BUFFY: You know, it's probably none of my business but I just gotta ask...
 
BUFFY: You smell this bad when you were alive?
 
BUFFY: 'Cause if it's a post-mortem thing, then boy, is my face red...
 
BUFFY: But just so you know, the fast-growing field of personal grooming has come a long way since you became a vampire.

ROCKER VAMPIRE: You're going? But you were having so much fun a minute ago!

RILEY: Buffy! What happened?

BUFFY: I can't believe I passed out. Do you think I'm a total wuss now?
 
RILEY: Oh, yeah. I like a girl who can play a few hard sets of tennis with a major stab wound.
 
BUFFY: You said it wasn't that bad.
 
RILEY: I said I've seen worse. There's a difference.
 
BUFFY: Well, at least no major organs got kebabed.
 
RILEY
I still think you need to see a real doctor.
 
BUFFY: That would put me in a real hospital which would get my real mom real freaked out. I can't do it. Don't worry. Accelerated healing powers come with the Slayer package. And the boyfriend who comes complete with combat medical training? That's just a Buffy Summers bonus.
 
RILEY: So tell me about the bad guy- or guys. What do you think they were?
 
BUFFY: Vampire.
 
RILEY: How many?
 
BUFFY: One.
 
RILEY: So... what? He was like a super-vampire or something?
 
BUFFY: No, he was the regular kind. He just beat me.
 
RILEY: That ever happen before?
 
BUFFY: I'm in the best physical shape of my life. I mean, if you're asking how it happened, I don't-

BUFFY: Dawn!
 
DAWN: Sorry to interrupt the sex-capades. I just wanted to tell you that Mom's coming.

JOYCE: Hi, Riley.
 
RILEY: Hey, Mrs. Summers. How're you feeling?
 
JOYCE: I'm fine, bordering on chipper and tomorrow planning on being obnoxious.
 
RILEY: Glad to hear it.
 
JOYCE: Buffy, when you have a minute I'd like to go over the grocery list for next week.
 
BUFFY: You got it.
 
JOYCE: Are you disinfecting something?
 
BUFFY: Huh? Oh, uh-
 
DAWN: Mine! Some nail polish experiments are doomed before they even begin.
 
JOYCE: But you keep pushing the envelope, honey.
 
DAWN: Did I just pull a Slayer-related Mom cover-up thing? Come on, who's the man?
 
BUFFY: You are. A very short, annoying man.
 
BUFFY: If I show you something, you promise you won't tell?
 
DAWN: Oh, cool! (off Buffy's look) I mean, gross!
 
BUFFY: And Mom cannot know. Okay? You'll help me with the household stuff?
 
DAWN: Oh, sure. I save your butt and you dump all your chores on me. (off Buffy's look) I got it. You're covered. We're good. Just lucky it's not bikini season.
 
RILEY: So Dawn takes household duty. I'll take tonight's patrol.
 
BUFFY: By yourself?
 
RILEY: Just a sweep.
 
BUFFY: Do me a favor? Will you take the gang along with?
 
RILEY: Okay. I will patrol with the group tonight.
 
DAWN: When do I get to patrol?
 
BUFFY: Not until you're never.
 
XANDER: What's with the hand move? Does that like mean something?
 
WILLOW: It's code. I think it breaks down to "choo-choo".
 
ANYA: It means to follow him. That, or wait here for him.
 
WILLOW: Ask.
 
XANDER: Hey, Riley! What's the (hand gesture) all about?
 
RILEY: It means yell real loud so the vampires who don't know we're coming will have a sporting chance.
 
XANDER: See, now he's all mean and sarcastic.
 
WILLOW: That's because you were doing all the yelling, Mr. Stealthy-Pants.
 
ANYA: It's their fault.
 
RILEY: Guys, I'm thinking if we split up, we could cover more ground. Tell you what? I'll take the cemeteries, you guys get the Bronze.
 
ANYA: Are we not being covert enough?
 
XANDER: We're sorry!
 
WILLOW: Sorry.
 
XANDER: We'll be sneakier. Promise.
 
RILEY: Okay. Just ditch the chips and watch my back.
 
WILLOW: Done.
 
XANDER: You know what he's like? He's like a cat. You know, a big jungle cat. How come I'm not like that? It's just so cool.
 
WILLOW: I think you're cool.

GILES: Here's another one. Early 18th Century Slayer.
 
Buffy closes her book with a sigh and sets it on the stack.
 
BUFFY: Good. Let's hope she'll be more helpful than this last one.
 
GILES: Why? What does it say?
 
BUFFY: Same as all the others. Slayer called... blah, blah... great protector... blah, blah... scary battles... blah, blah... oops! She's dead. Where are the details?
 
GILES: Details? Well, it says this Slayer forged her own weapons.
 
BUFFY: Gotta love a gal with an anvil. But where are the details of the Slayer's last battle? You know, what made that fight special? Why did she lose?
 
GILES: You didn't lose last night, Buffy. You just-
 
BUFFY: Got really close. I slipped up, Giles. I've been training harder than ever and still I... (beat) And there's nothing in any of these books to help me understand why. I mean... look, I realize that every Slayer comes with an expiration mark on the package. But I want mine to be a long time from now. Like a Cheeto. If there were just a few good descriptions of what took out the other Slayers, maybe it would help me to understand my mistake, to keep it from happening again.
 
GILES: Yes, well, the problem is after a final battle, it's difficult to get any... well, the Slayer's not... she's rather...
 
BUFFY: It's okay to use the D-word, Giles.
 
GILES: Dead. And hence not very forthcoming.
 
BUFFY: Why didn't the Watchers keep fuller accounts of it? The journals just stop.
 
GILES: Well, I suppose if they're anything like me, they just find the whole subject too-
 
BUFFY: Unseemly? Damn. Love ya but you Watchers are such prigs sometimes.
 
GILES: Painful... I was going to say.
 
GILES: But you're right. Accounts of the final battles would be very helpful. But there's no one left to tell the tales.
 
GILES: What?

SPIKE: Ow! (beat) Wait. Not ow. You feeling all right, Slayer? This stuff usually hurts.
 
BUFFY: Don't even start, Spike.
 
SPIKE: What do you want?
 
BUFFY: Slayers. You killed two of them.
 
SPIKE: I did.
 
BUFFY: You're gonna show me how.

SPIKE: You know, there quite a few American beers that are highly underrated. This unfortunately is not one of them.
 
BUFFY: Update, Spike. We're not here to discuss the fine choice of hops. It's about two Slayers: one in China during the Boxer Rebellion, one in New York.
 
BUFFY: Both got killed by you. Tell the tale, you get the cash.
 
SPIKE: Right. You want to learn all about how I bested the Slayers and you want to learn fast. Right, then. We fought. I won. The end. Pay up.
 
BUFFY: That's not what I-
 
SPIKE: What did you want, eh? A quick demo? A blow-for-blow description you can map out and memorize? It's not about the moves, love. And since I agreed to your little proposition, we can do this my way. Wings.
 
BUFFY: What?
 
SPIKE: Spicy buffalo wings. Order me up a plate. I'm feelin' peckish.
 
BUFFY: Excuse me-
 
SPIKE: As I thought. Some nasty thing got a taste of you.
 
BUFFY: Don't get all excited. I'm fine.
 
SPIKE: Oh, right. Stuck in a dark corner with a creature you loathe, diggin' up past uglies, 'cause you're fine.
 
BUFFY: Just tell me what I want to know.
 
SPIKE: I told you. No one's narrating on an empty stomach here.
 
BUFFY: Were you born this big a pain in the ass?
 
SPIKE: What can I tell you, baby? I've always been bad.

SPIKE: Luminous... oh, no, no, no. Irradiant's better.
 
WAITER: Care for an hors d'oeuvre, sir?
 
SPIKE: Oh, quickly! I'm the very spirit of vexation. What's another word for "gleaming"? It's a perfectly perfect word as many words go but the bother is nothing rhymes, you see.
 
SPIKE: Cecily...

ARISTOCRAT #1: I mean to point out that it's something of a mystery and the police should keep an open mind.
 
ARISTOCRAT #2: Ah, William! Favor us with your opinion. What do you make of this rash of disappearances sweeping through our town? Animals or thieves?
 
SPIKE: I prefer not to think of such dark, ugly business at all. That's what the police are for. (looks at Cecily) I prefer placing my energies into creating things of beauty.
 
ARISTOCRAT #3: I see. Well, don't withhold, William.
 
ARISTOCRAT #1: Rescue us from a dreary topic.
 
SPIKE: Careful. The inks are still wet. Please, it's not finished.
 
ARISTOCRAT #3: Don't be shy. (reads) "My heart expands/'tis grown a bulge in it/inspired by your beauty, effulgent." (laughs) Effulgent?
 
ARISTOCRAT #2: And that's actually one of his better compositions.
 
ARISTOCRAT #1: Have you heard? They call him William the Bloody because of his bloody awful poetry!
 
ARISTOCRAT #3: It suits him. I'd rather have a railroad spike through my head than listen to that awful stuff!

SPIKE: Cecily?
 
CECILY: Oh. Leave me alone.
 
SPIKE: Oh, they're vulgarians. They're not like you and I.
 
CECILY: You and I? I'm going to ask you a very personal question and I demand an honest answer. Do you understand?
 
CECILY: Your poetry, it's... they're... not written about me, are they?
 
SPIKE: They're about how I feel.
 
CECILY: Yes, but are they about me?
 
SPIKE: Every syllable.
 
CECILY: Oh, God!
 
SPIKE: Oh, I know... it's sudden and... please, if they're no good, they're only words but... the feeling behind them... I love you, Cecily.
 
CECILY: Please stop!
 
SPIKE: I know I'm a bad poet but I'm a good man and all I ask is that... that you try to see me-
 
CECILY: I do see you. That's the problem. You're nothing to me, William. You're beneath me.
 
SPIKE: Watch where you're going!
 
DRUSILLA: And I wonder... what possible catastrophe came crashing down from heaven and brought this dashing stranger to tears?
 
SPIKE: Nothing. I wish to be alone.
 
DRUSILLA: Oh, I see you. A man surrounded by fools who cannot see his strength, his vision, his glory. (beat) That and burning baby fish swimming all around your head.
 
SPIKE: That's quite close enough. I've heard tales of London pickpockets. You'll not be getting my purse, I tell you.
 
DRUSILLA: Don't need a purse.
 
DRUSILLA: Your wealth lies here... and here. In the spirit and... imagination. You walk in worlds the others can't begin to imagine.
 
SPIKE: Oh, yes! I mean, no. I mean... mother's expecting me.

DRUSILLA: I see what you want. Something glowing and glistening. Something... effulgent.

SPIKE: Effulgent.
 
DRUSILLA: Do you want it?
 
Spike has never wanted anything more.
 
SPIKE: Oh, yes! (touches her chest) God, yes.

RILEY: Guys...
 
XANDER: What you got?
 
RILEY: That's him. Let's go.

XANDER: It sounds like a party in there.
 
RILEY: Forget about crashing. There's too many of them. We'll come back at daybreak when they're asleep and we're better armed. It's okay. We can kill them just as dead in the morning.
 
BUFFY: So you traded up on the food chain. Then what?
 
SPIKE: No, please. Don't make it sound like something you'd flip past on the Discovery Channel. Becoming a vampire is a profound and powerful experience. I could feel this new strength coursing through me. Getting killed made me feel alive for the very first time. I was through living by society's rules. Decided to make a few of my own. Of course, in order to do that... I had to get myself a gang.
 
ANGELUS: Perhaps it's my advancing years that makes me so forgetful, William. Remind me. Why don't we kill you?
 
SPIKE: ...ike.
 
ANGELUS: What's that?
 
SPIKE: It's Spike now.
 
SPIKE: You'd do well to remember it, mate.
 
ANGELUS: I'm not your mate. And when did you start talking like that?
 
DARLA: Look, we barely got out of London alive because of you. Everywhere we go, it's the same story and now-
 
ANGELUS: You've got me and my women hiding in the luxury of a mine shaft, all because William the Bloody likes the attention. This is not a reputation we need.
 
SPIKE: Oh, I'm sorry. Did I sully our good name? We're vampires.
 
ANGELUS: All the more reason to use a certain amount of finesse.
 
SPIKE: Bollocks! That stuff's for the frilly cuffs-and-collars crowd. I'll take a good brawl any day.
 
ANGELUS: And every time you do, we become the hunted.
 
DARLA: I think our boys are going to fight.
 
DRUSILLA: The King of Cups expects a picnic! But this is not his birthday.
 
DARLA: Good point...
 
SPIKE: Yeah, you know what I prefer to being hunted? Getting caught.
 
ANGELUS: That's a brilliant strategy really... pure cunning.
 
SPIKE: Sod off! (laughs) Come on. When was the last time you unleashed it? All out fight in a mob, back against the wall, nothing but fists and fangs? Don't you ever get tired of fights you know you're going to win?
 
ANGELUS: No. A real kill. A good kill. It takes pure artistry. Without that, we're just animals.
 
SPIKE: Poofter!

SPIKE: Now you're gettin' it!
 
ANGELUS: You can't keep this up forever. If I can't teach you, maybe someday an angry crowd will. That... or the Slayer.
 
SPIKE: What's a Slayer?
 
SPIKE: After that, I was obsessed. I mean, to most vampires, the Slayer was the subject of cold sweat and frightened whispers. But I never hid. Hell, I sought her out. I mean, if you're looking for fun, there's death, there's glory and sod all else, right? (shrugs) I was young.
 
BUFFY: So how'd you kill her?
 
SPIKE: Funny you should ask.
 
SPIKE: Lesson the first: a Slayer must always reach for her weapon.

SPIKE: I've already got mine.
 
SPIKE: A good thing, too. Become a vampire, you've got nothing to fear. Nothing but one girl. That's you, honey. Back then... it was her.

SPIKE: Just like I pictured it. This good for you?

SLAYER: Tell my mother I'm sorry...
 
SPIKE: I'm sorry, love, I don't speak Chinese.
 
SPIKE: A fella could get used to this.

DRUSILLA: Oh, Spike, look at the wonderful mess you've made. That's a Slayer you've done in. Naughty... wicked... Spike.
 
SPIKE: You ever hear them saying the blood of a Slayer is a powerful aphrodisiac?
 
SPIKE: Here, now... have a taste.
 
DARLA: So where have you two been?
 
DRUSILLA: May I tell?
 
SPIKE: No need to be humble.
 
DRUSILLA: My little Spike just killed himself a Slayer.
 
ANGEL: Congratulations. I guess that makes you one of us.
 
SPIKE: Don't be so glum, mate! The way you tell it, one Slayer snuffs it, another one rises. I figure there's a new Chosen One getting all chosen as we speak. I tell you what... when and if this new bird does show up, I'll give you first crack at her.
 
DRUSILLA: I smell fear.
 
ANGEL: Yeah, this whole place reeks of it.
 
DRUSILLA: It's intoxicating!
 
ANGEL: Let's get out of here. This rebellion's starting to bore me.

SPIKE: That was the best night of my life.
 
SPIKE: And I've had some sweet ones. (off her look) What are you looking at?
 
BUFFY: You got off on it.
 
SPIKE: Well, yeah. I suppose you're telling me you don't? (laughs) How many of my kind reckon you've done?
 
BUFFY: Not enough.
 
SPIKE: And we just keep coming. But you can kill a hundred, a thousand, a thousand thousand and the enemies of Hell besides and all we need is for one of us- just one- sooner or later to have the thing we're all hoping for.
 
BUFFY: And that would be what?
 
SPIKE: One... good... day.
 
SPIKE: Hey! You asked and I'm tellin'. The problem with you, Summers, is you've gotten so good, you're starting to think you're immortal.
 
BUFFY: Not really. I just know I can handle myself.
 
SPIKE: Oh? Then how do you explain this?
 
BUFFY: So that's it? Lesson over?
 
SPIKE: Not even close. Come on.

ROCKER VAMPIRE: Killed with her own weapon!
 
ROCKER VAMPIRE: They ought to put this in a museum!
 
RILEY: You know what they put in museums? Mostly dead things.

BUFFY: Give it to me.
 
BUFFY: What?
 
SPIKE: Lesson the second ask the right questions. You want to know how I beat 'em?
 
SPIKE: The question isn't "How'd I win?". The question is "Why'd they lose?".
 
BUFFY: What's the difference?
 
SPIKE: There's a big difference, love.
 
BUFFY: How'd you kill the second one?
 
SPIKE: Hmm? A bit like this.

BUFFY: That didn't hurt?
 
SPIKE: I knew I couldn't touch you. If there's no intent to hurt you, then that chip they shoved up my brain never activates. If, on the other hand...

SPIKE: See, now that hurt.
 
BUFFY: Yeah? This hurt too?

BUFFY: How'd you kill 'em, Spike?

SPIKE: You're not ready to know.
 
BUFFY: I'm ready.
 
SPIKE: Okay, then. Went like this.

SPIKE: The first was all business but the second, she had a touch of your style.
 
SPIKE: She was cunning, resourceful... oh, did I mention? Hot. I could have danced all night with that one.
 
BUFFY: You think we're dancing?
 
SPIKE: That's all we've ever done.
 
SPIKE: And the thing about the dance is, you never get to stop.
 
SPIKE: Every day you wake up, it's the same bloody question that haunts you: is today the day I die?
 
SPIKE: Death is on your heels, baby, and sooner or later it's gonna catch you.

SPIKE: And part of you wants it... not only to stop the fear and uncertainty, but because you're just a little bit in love with it.
 
SPIKE: Death is your art. You make it with your hands, day after day.
  
SPIKE: That final gasp. That look of peace. Part of you is desperate to know What's it like? Where does it lead you? And now you see, that's the secret. Not the punch you didn't throw or the kicks you didn't land. Every Slayer... has a death wish.
 
SPIKE: Even you.
 
SPIKE: The only reason you've lasted as long as you have is you've got ties to the world... your mum, your brat kid sister, the Scoobies. They all tie you here but you're just putting off the inevitable.
 
SPIKE: Sooner or later, you're gonna want it. And the second- the second- that happens...
 
SPIKE: You know I'll be there. I'll slip in... have myself a real good day.
 
SPIKE: Here endeth the lesson. I just wonder if you'll like it as much as she did.
 
BUFFY: Get out of my sight. Now.
 
SPIKE: Oh... did I scare ya? You're the Slayer. Do something about it. Hit me. Come on. One good swing. You know you want to.
 
BUFFY: I mean it.
 
SPIKE: So do I. Give it me good, Buffy. Do it!
 
BUFFY: Spike...
 
BUFFY: What the hell are you doing?
 
SPIKE: Come on. I can feel it, Slayer. You know you want to dance.
 
BUFFY: Say it's true. Say I do want to.
 
BUFFY: It wouldn't be you, Spike. It would never be you.
 
BUFFY: You're beneath me.

HARMONY: Spike, what are you doing?
 
SPIKE: Beneath me... I'll show her.
 
SPIKE: Put her six bloody feet beneath me. Hasn't got a death wish? Bitch won't need one.

HARMONY: Okay, I'm trying to be supportive here so don't drive a stake through my heart like last time, but you can't kill Buffy. She's the Slayer. She is so gonna kick your ass.
 
SPIKE: I've got two barrels here that'll prove you wrong.
 
HARMONY: I knew you'd take this personally. You are so sensitive! How are you going to kill her? Think! The second you even point that thing at her, you're gonna be all ahhh!
 
HARMONY: And then you'll get bitch-slapped up and down Main Street unless she's had enough and just stakes you!
 
SPIKE: Sure, it'll hurt like hell for about two hours...
 
SPIKE: But she'll be dead just a little longer than that.
 
HARMONY: Fine! But don't come crying to me when you fail. You couldn't kill her before you got the chip. You had plenty of chances!

DRUSILLA: Why can't you kill her?

SPIKE: You're the one who keeps bringing her up!

SPIKE: I haven't said a word about the bloody Slayer since we left California. She's on the other side of the planet, Dru!
 
DRUSILLA: But you're lying! I can still see her floating all around you, laughing. Why? Why won't you push her away?
 
SPIKE: But I did, pet. I did it for you. You keep punishing me. Carrying on with creatures like this.
 
CHAOS DEMON: Okay, you guys obviously have a thing going on here.
 
DRUSILLA: I have to find my pleasures, Spike. You taste like ashes.
 
SPIKE: So this is my fault now?
 
CHAOS DEMON: I didn't know she was seeing somebody. (off Spike's look) I should take off.
 
SPIKE: Yeah, why don't you do that?
 
DRUSILLA: You can't blame the ghoul, Spike. You're all covered with her. I look at you... all I see is the Slayer.
 
BUFFY: Hey, I put together that grocery list for you.
 
JOYCE: Oh, great. Thanks, hon.
 
BUFFY: Are you okay?
 
JOYCE: I'm fine. Have you seen my conditioner?
 
BUFFY: Did you look under the sink?
 
BUFFY: Where are you going?
 
JOYCE: Oh, I was hoping to put this off but... you know the nothing that I've been dealing with the last couple of weeks? It might not be nothing.
 
BUFFY: What is it?
 
JOYCE: I'm staying overnight at the hospital for observation. I'm getting a CAT scan. 
 
JOYCE: It's only one night and they say even if there is something, it's still very early if they didn't see it before. I'm going to be fine.
 
BUFFY: I know you will.
 
BUFFY: What do you want now?
  
SPIKE: What's wrong?
 
BUFFY: I don't want to talk about it.
 
SPIKE: Is there something I can do?
