Buffy Episode #56: "Graduatoin Day" (Part 2) Transcript

Willow: "What are you doing?" 
Oz: "Panicking." 
Oz and Willow in bed after Oz is done panicking. 
In the library the Mayor throws the rapier back to Giles, who catches it.  
Mayor:  "See you at the Graduation." 
Buffy and Angel in the sewers.  
Buffy:  "I want my life to be with you."  
Angel: "I don't."  
Buffy:  "I can't believe you're breaking up with me." 
On the street in front of the Professor's place Angel gets shot and collapses. 
In the library Buffy pulls out the arrow, Giles smells it.  
Angel: "It's poison.  I can feel it." 
Angel collapses on the floor. 
Oz:  "The only way to cure this thing is to drain the blood of a Slayer." 
Buffy and Faith fighting in her apartment.  
Buffy:  "If Angel needs to drain the blood of a Slayer then I'll bring him one." 
Buffy and Faith fall through the window.  Buffy stabs Faith.  
Faithr:  "You killed me."  
Faith falls and lands on the bed of a truck driving by.
Buffy lays down the knife looking shocked then walks over to a ladder and climbs down the outside of the building. 
Pan over and up to the Mayor looking out through the broken window.  The Mayor turns around as a vampire comes up behind him and says:  
Vampire: There is no one here, Sir." 
Mayor:  "No.  No, she took the fight outside.  My Faith doesn't like to be cooped up."  
Walks over to the vampire.  
Mayor: "We have to find them.  Put everyone on it.  Do it now."  
Turns away from the vampire. 
Vampire:  "But Sir, the ascension…" 
Mayor spins back around and screams at the vampire:  
Mayor: "Find them!"  
The vampire leaves. 
The Mayor starts pacing around, clearly very worried, talking to himself 
Mayor: "Faith's a good girl.  She can take anything they'll throw at her.  She's going to be all right.  She'll be all right.  She'll be all right."

Part 2

Library  Giles comes out of his office massaging his right shoulder, while Xander walks in carrying a Styrofoam cup. 
Xander:  "Any word from Buffy?" 
Giles:  "Not yet." 
Xander:  "Here is your cup of coffee.  Brewed from the finest Colombian lighter fluid" 
Sits down across form Giles. 
Giles:  "Thank you." 
Takes a sip.  
Giles: "Horrible." 
Takes another sip. 
Xander:  "Aren't you supposed to be drinking tea anyway?" 
Giles:  "Tea is soothing.  I wish to be tense." 
Xander:  "Okay.  But you are destroying a perfectly good cultural stereotype here."
Giles:  "Look through the, ah… Kepler (?) volumes."  
Xander picks up a book.  
Giles: "Any reference to the demon Olvukan."  
Xander opens the book.  
Giles: "Powers, weaknesses, hat size, anything.  There's got to be something." 
Xander:  "Still batting zero?" 
Giles looks at him. 
Xander: "But I mean, ah… in cricket?" 
Cordelia walks into the library looking upset. 
Xander:  "Cordy!  What's up?" 
Cordelia:  "I demand an explanation." 
Xander:  "For what?" 
Cordelia:  "Wesley." 
Xander:  "Uh - inbreeding?" 
Cordelia:  "So very funny.  Any minute I am sure to laugh.  I just got off the phone with him.  He could hardly speak he was so upset.  He said there was something about a fight?  And he is leaving the country." 
Giles:  "Should I assay remorse?" 
Cordelia:  "Just tell me what's going on." 
Giles:  "Buffy has quit the council.  She'll not be working with Wesley from now on." 
Cordelia:  "But he is her Watcher." 
Giles:  "Buffy no longer needs a Watcher." 
Cordelia:  "Well, does he have to leave the country?  I mean, you got fired, and you still hang around like a big loser.  Why can't he?" 
Xander:  "Cordelia.  We are trying to stop a massacre here.  Want to give us a hand?" 
Cordelia hesitates a moment then walks over to a chair taking off her jacket.  
Cordelia: "Sure.  -  This is just *such* a Buffy thing to do." 
Sits down.  
Cordelia: "She is *always* thinking of herself."

Cut to the mansion.  Angel is laying in bed.  The arrow wound looks red and inflamed.  He is twisting restlessly, clearly in pain, and moaning softly.  Willow dabs at his sweaty forehead with a wet rag.  Angel opens his eyes. 
Willow:  "You're awake." 
Angel:  "You've been watching over me?"  
Willow nods.  Angel takes her hand and starts kissing it.  He lays his other hand on  Willows right arm. 
Willow:  "Well, - we've been taking turns." 
Angel:  "I thought… - I thought I'd never see you again" 
Willow looks at him surprised and confused.  
Angel: "I can't leave you.  I was wrong.  I need you."
Willow:  "Oh!"   
she pats his hand  
Willow: "You mean you need Buffy!" 
Angel:  "Willow?' 
Willow:  "Yes, - right!"  
She points at herself smiling  
Willow: "Willow!" 
Angel trying to sit up
Angel: "Where is she?" 
Willow pushes him back down worried
Willow: "She'll be back soon."  
Angel sinks back and closes his eyes. 
Willow gets up and walks out into the main room where Oz is waiting for her. 
Oz:  "Any change?" 
Willow:  "He's delirious.  He thought I was Buffy." 
Oz:  "You too, huh?" 
Willow:  "I hope she gets here soon.  She better if… " 
Oz: "Yeah." 
Willow:  "I feel so… I feel so guilty." 
Oz:  "Guilty?" 
Willow:  "Well, things are so terrible, and things are coming apart, - but in some ways, this is the best night of my life." 
Oz blinks and reaches for her hand with a half smile
Oz: "Us." 
Willow smiles, nods and moves closer to him
Willow: "Us." 
They kiss.  The door opens, Buffy walks in slowly, staring at the ground.  Willow and Oz break apart guiltily. 
Willow:  "I just checked on him, just now.  We're watching." 
Buffy walks up to then, looking unhappy.  The left corner of her bottom lip is busted. 
Oz:  "Did you find Faith?"  
Buffy just looks at them saying nothing. 
Willow:  "You didn't…  She's not here?" 
Buffy shakes her head slightly
Buffy: "How is he?" 
Oz:  "He comes in and out.  I think the - pain is - less.  Now." 
Buffy frowns slightly
Buffy: "Would you guys… - I'd like to be alone with him." 
Oz and Willow look at each other.  
Oz:  "Of course."  
As they walk past Buffy Willow turns to her and says
Willow: "We'll try to find another cure." 
Buffy quietly as they leave the house
Buffy: "Thanks."

Cut to Angel lying on his bed.  Buffy sits down and takes his hand. 
Angel:  "Buffy."  
Buffy lays her right hand against the side of his face  
Angel: "Is that you?" 
Buffy gives him a slight smile
Buffy: "It's me." 
Angel tries to smile in return
Angel: "I didn't want to go, without seeing you."
Buffy puts a finger on his lips to stop him from talking. 
Buffy:  "Angel, I can cure you." 
Angel:  "It's okay. - I'm ready." 
Buffy:  "Angel listen to me."
Takes a hold of his shoulders.
BuffyL "Sit up."
Angel scoots up a little higher, but he is weak and moving clearly hurts a great deal. 
Buffy:  "You're gonna live.  You have to live." 
Angel:  "What way?" 
Buffy:  "Drink…"  
Angel frowns at her.  Buffy takes off her jacket, a determined expression on her face.  
Buffy: "Drink me." 
Angel stares at her in shock, he shakes his head rejecting the idea
Angel: "No." 
Buffy:  "It's the only way." 
Angel keeps shaking his head and forces himself up out of the bed, pushing Buffy aside
Angel: "No. - Get away." 
Buffy takes a hold of his right arm as he stands up, looking up at him
Buffy: "It'll save you." 
Angel is looking down at the floor
Angel: "It'll kill you." 
Buffy:  "Maybe not. -. Not if you don't take it all." 
Angel keeps shaking his head, still not looking at her
Angel: "You can't ask me to do that." 
Buffy:  "I won't let you die.  I can't."  
He still won't look at her.  
Buffy: "Angel the blood of a Slayer is the only cure." 
Angel finally glances at Buffy
Angel: "Faith…" 
Buffy swallows and answers quietly
Buffy: "I tired. - I killed her." 
Angel shakes his head and lurches away from Buffy
Angel: "Then it's over."
Angel stumbles into the main room.  He has trouble walking straight.  Bumps into the wall, then stumbles and catches himself on the sofa table, spilling a pewter pitcher and plate onto the floor.  Buffy grabs him by the arms and pulls him up to face her. 
Buffy:  "It is never over!  I won't let you die.  Drink!" 
Angel glances up at her swaying in her grip
Angel: "Please…" 
Buffy looks at him, then pulls back her right fist and hits his left temple.  His head snaps around but he stays on his feet.  He turns back to look at Buffy and she hits him again.  He still doesn't go down, but it takes him a little longer to come back up.  Buffy hits him a third time and this time Angel spins back with a growl vamped out.  He just stands there, staring at her, while Buffy pulls down the shoulder strap of her shirt, then grabs him by the hair at the back of his head.  She looks at him for a moment then firmly pulls his head down against her neck and holds him there.  For a moment they remain like this.  Then we see a close-up of his yellow eye looking down and he suddenly bites down.  Buffy gasps with the pain but holds still.  Angel is holding on to her now and you get to hear all those sucking and drinking noises.  Close-up of his mouth on Buffy's neck. Some blood is running out beneath his lips and running down her shoulder.  Buffy's face scrunches up, she mouths what looks like 'Oh Lord' and slowly sinks backwards to the floor.  With Angel lying on top still drinking, Buffy's left hand reaches out and finds the pewter pitcher.  She crushes it in her hand.  The camera keeps jerking around the whole time, and Buffy is clearly not enjoying the experience.  She puts her hands against his sides as if she was going to push him off, but kicks out with her left leg instead, breaking the sofa table in half.  She stares up into the camera a tear in the corner of her left eye.  Then her eyes drift shut and her head sinks to the side just as Angel finally rolls off her, panting.  His face morphs back to human and he pushes himself up looking over at Buffy.  The redness around the arrow wound is gone. 
Angel: "Buffy?"  
She lies motionless eyes closed. 
Angel:  "Buffy!"

Part 3

Angel runs into the hospital carrying a limp Buffy in his arms. 
Angel: "I need some help!  She lost a lot of blood." 
Nurse:  "What happened?" 
Angel runs into the ER
Angel: "She needs blood." 
Nurse:  "Try to stay calm.  We're going to take care of her." 
Angel lays Buffy down on a bed
Angel: "Something bit her.  She needs a transfusion." 
Doctor:  "You found her?"  
Angel: "Yes."  
Doctor:  "Was she conscious?" 
Angel:  "Yes."  
Doctor:  "Are you *sure*?"  
Angel:  "I'm sure." 
Doctor:  "Okay. I need a type, I need cross-match.  Get her on two lines of Wringer's lactate, and watch for hyper-bulimic shock. Tell me: What - happened?" 
Angel:  "Something bit her.  I don't know what." 
Doctor:  "Okay.  I need a rabies shot treatment. Any allergies?" 
Angel:  "None."  
He rips the handle of the door without really noticing what he's doing. The doctor jumps back surprised.  Angel (clearly upset and at the end of his patience)
Angel: "*Just* help her." 
Doctor:  "You two been doing drugs? (Angel just looks at him) You want her to live, you have to be straight with me." 
Angel:  "She's clean." 
Doctor:  "All right.  Wait outside.  Let us work." 
Angel:  "A phone." 
Doctor:  "Right out there." 
With a last look at Buffy laying on the bed Angel leaves the room and goes over to a payphone digging some change out of his pocket.  There is a police officer standing in the hall.  While Angel dials we hear a different 
Doctor:  "The bones are set, and the damage to the kidneys is repairable."  
Camera pans through a nearby door to show a doctor talking to a distraught looking Mayor. 
Doctor: "But the head trauma, its… well its simply to severe.  You know, it’s a wonder she's alive at all, with the blood loss. - I… I'm sorry Sir, there is almost no chance at all that she is ever going to regain consciousness." 
Camera pans over to show Faith laying in a hospital bed.  She looks badly bruised.  She is wearing an oxygen tube, an IV, and several monitoring devices.  You can hear a heart monitor beeping.  The Mayor reaches down and gently brushes her hair from her forehead and strokes her cheek. 
Mayor:  "It's your day."  
Camera pans to show a nurse coming up to the doctor behind him. 
Nurse:  "We have another girl with severe blood loss.  Doctor Pal wants you to prep this on an anti cubal cut down (??)." 
Doctor:  "I'll be right there." 
Camera pans back to the Mayor, who realizes just who that other girl must be.  He leaves the room and walks over to Buffy's bed.  He puts his left hand over her mouth, also blocking her nose.  Buffy starts to move her head with a soft protest. 
A nurse comes in and tries to pull his hand away, but is unable to budge him. 
Nurse: "Oh, my God.  Sir!  No!"  
She turns and runs out of the room shouting
Nurse: "Somebody call security!" 
Close up on Buffy struggling harder.  A pair of hands grab the Mayor and push him away from the bed. 
Angel:  "Don't do that!" 
The Mayor stumbles back, then gets right into Angel's face
Mayor: "I will.  I do that and *worse*.  Murderous little fiend!  Did you see what she did to my Faith?" 
Angel:  "Hadn't any plans to weep over that one." 
Mayor:  "Well, I'd get set for some weeping if I were you.  I'd get set for a *world* of pain!  Misery loves company, young man, and I'm looking to share that with you and your *whore*!" 
Angel's hands shoot forward and he throws him clear across the room.  The Mayor impacts with a window looking onto the corridor, breaking it, then drops to the floor overturning a small metal hospital table holding various implements.  The noise brings two nurses to see what's going on.  The Mayor looks up at a mad Angel and picks himself up laughing. 
Mayor brushing off his suit and gesturing towards Angel
Mayor: "Looks like somebody has been eating his spinach. No, its okay, folks.  It's all right.  The show's not over, but there will be a short intermission. Don't want to miss the second act. All kinds of excitement!" 
Angel:  "I'll be there."  
Swallowing hard he looks back at Buffy laying still on the bed.

Cut to the hallway. Angel is crouched down next to the door to Buffy's room, his back against the wall.  The door at the end of the hallway opens.  Giles, Willow, Oz and Xander come in.  Angel gets up. 
Giles:  "How is she?" 
Angel:  "She's fine.  She's asleep." 
Oz:  "Well, you seem all right, too." 
Angel looks down and wraps his arms around himself
Angel: "Yeah." 
Xander looks him up and down
Xander: "What happened?" 
Willow:  "When we left her she was fine.  Did Faith…" 
Angel interrupts her still not looking at any of them
Angel: "Faith's out of the picture.  Buffy put her into a coma." 
Xander takes a deep breath and stares at Angel
Xander: "And?" 
Angel shaken and still not meeting their eyes
Angel: "Buffy cured me. - Made me…" 
trails off. 
Giles:  "You fed off her." 
Angel looks up at him, takes a deep breath and nods his head once
Angel:  "Yes." 
Giles:  "How much?"  
Xander swallows hard and looks away. 
Angel:  "She's gonna be fine." 
Willow:  "She won't be a vampire?" 
Angel:  "No. - She didn't feed off me." 
Xander:  "Well, its just good to know that when the chips are down and things look grim you'll feed off the girl who *loves* you to save your own *ass*!" 
Angel says nothing.  Willow and Oz just look at him. 
Giles:  "You better go, Angel.  We'll watch over her." 
Angel:  "I don't want to…" 
Giles:  "The sun will be up soon." 
Angel hesitates, clearly reluctant to leave, glances up at Giles.  Swallows hard and nods looking down, half looks towards Buffy's room, then slowly walks away. 
Xander:  "Gosh, I'm really going to miss him when he leaves town." 
Giles:  "Let's go find out how Buffy's doing." 
They walk out of the picture as Angel leaves through the door at the end of the hallway.

Cut to Buffy walking through Faith's apartment her arms crossed in front of her.  There are cardboard boxes stacked everywhere.  Buffy stops and sees a cat jump up on Faith's bed. 
Buffy:  "Who's going to look after him?" 
Faith:  "It's a she.  And aren't these things supposed to take care of themselves?" 
walks up behind Buffy and stops next to her. 
Buffy:  "A higher power guiding us?" 
Faith looks at her then turns away and keeps walking towards the camera
Faith: "I'm pretty sure that's not what I meant." 
Buffy looking down
Buffy:  "There's something I'm supposed to be doing." 
Faith:  "Oh yeah. - Miles to go - Little Ms. Muffet counting down from 7-3-0." 
Buffy:  "Great. - Riddles." 
Faith standing in front of the broken window looking out
Faith:  "Sorry, it's my head.  A lot of new stuff." 
Buffy looks at her with a half smile.  The cat on the bed turns for a split second into the image of a girl (Faith?) laying on the bed in white gown at the same time as Faith still looking out the broken window says
Faith: "They are never going to fix this, are they?" 
Buffy:  "What about you?" 
Faith turns around and gestures at her head
Faith: "Scar tissue.  It fades.  It all fades." 
Buffy looks down with a frown.  For a split second Faith's bloody knife appears in the palm of her hand. 
Faith as Buffy looks back up
Faith: "You want to know the deal?  Human weakness - never goes away.  Not even his." 
Buffy with a half smile
Buffy: "Is this your mind or mine?" 
Faith with a short laugh
Faith: "Beats me."  
Buffy gives a little laugh in return and looks down.  Faith walks towards her
Faith: "Getting towards that time." 
Buffy looks at all the boxes and the weapons laid out on the table beside her
Buffy: "How are you going to fit all this stuff?" 
Faith:  "Not gonna.  It's yours." 
Buffy:  "I can't use all of this!" 
Faith:  "Just take what you need."
reaches her right hand up to touch Buffy's cheek
Faith: "You're ready?" 
Flash to white and to Buffy waking up in the hospital.  She gets out of bed and slowly walks over to where Faith lies.  She looks down at her then softly kisses her forehead.

Cut to Buffy, fully dressed, walking down the corridor where Xander is pacing while the others are sitting on a bench.  They see her and get up to greet her. 
Willow:  "Buffy!" 
Xander:  "Are you okay?" 
Giles:  "How do you feel?" 
Buffy:  "Is Angel here?" 
Oz:  "He had to go.  It got kinda sunny." 
Buffy:  "Get him.  Get everyone." 
Xander:  "What exactly is up?" 
Giles:  "Buffy, are you sure you're all right?" 
Buffy:  "I'm ready." 
Willow:  "Ready for what?" 
Buffy:  "War."

Part 4

In front of Sunnydale High: there are benches set up for the graduation and a podium for the speaker.  Snyder stands at a table holding a box full of diplomas, tapping one of them in his hands and looking around, then sticking it into the box with the others.

Cut to the library Buffy is sitting on a chair with her back to the door, facing the others.  Giles and Xander on the right side of the table, Willow and Oz on the left, Cordelia standing just left of the steps, while Angel is over against the wall on the right side of the steps in the shadows.

Buffy:  "So, am I crazy?" 
Willow:  "Well, 'crazy' is such a *strong* word." 
Giles:  "Let's not rule it out though." 
Buffy:  "You don't think it can be done?" 
Giles:  "I didn't say that.  I might, - but not yet." 
Cordelia:  "I personally don't think it's impossible to come up with a crazier plan." 
Oz:  "We attack the Mayor with humus."  
Everyone looks at him. 
Cordelia:  "I stand corrected." 
Oz:  "Just trying to keep things in perspective." 
Cordelia:  "Thank you. - My point however is, crazy or not, it's pretty much the only plan. - Besides, it's Buffy's, - and she's slay gal, - you know, Ms little Likes-to-fight.  So.." 
Xander:  "I think there was a 'yea' vote buried in there somewhere." 
Buffy:  "Well, I'm going to need every single one of you on board.  Especially you Xander.  You're sort of the key figure here." 
Xander:  "Key? - Me?  (takes a deep breath) Okay, - pride, - humility, - and here is the mind numbing fear.  (sighs)  What do I have to do?" 
Buffy:  "Do you remember any of your military training from when you became soldier guy?" 
Xander:  "Uh, rocket launcher?" 
Buffy:  "Rocket launcher not going to get it done.  I mean, it took a volcano to kill one of these things last time." 
Giles gets up and walks towards her
Giles:  "Um, Buffy, all of this is rather depended on your being able to control the Mayor." 
Buffy:  "Faith told me to play on his human weakness." 
Willow:  "Faith told you?  Was that before or after you put her into a coma?" 
Buffy:  "After."  
Willow:  "Oh."  
Then looks confused over at Oz. 
Giles:  "His weakness."  
Buffy:  "Right."  
Giles:  "Which is…?" 
Buffy:  "You know I do all this planing.  I'm in charge here, even though I am really not at my best…" 
Giles puts his glasses back on
Giles: "Well, let's… let's…ah, let's think." 
Oz:  "Well, Angel, you hung with him the most.  Is there something that he's afraid of?"  
Buffy's looking down uncomfortably. 
Angel:  "Well, he's not crazy about germs." 
Cordelia:  "Of course, that's it.  We attack him with germs!" 
Buffy:  "Great!  We'll corner him and then you can sneeze on him." 
Cordelia:  "No!  No, we'll get a box with the Ebola virus and… and….  Or it doesn't even have to be real, we can just get a box that says Ebola on it and… uhm (snaps her fingers) chase him… with the box…" 
(Oz frowns and no one else says anything)
Xander:  "I'm starting to lean towards the humus offensive." 
Oz:  "He'll never see it coming." 
Angel:  "Faith."  
Buffy: "Faith?" 
Angel:  "At the hospital he was grieving.  Seriously crazed, and not just in a homicidal I want to be a demon way.  She is his weak link." 
Wesley comes in the door behind Buffy
Buffy:  "Faith.  I can work that." 
 looks up at Giles)
Wesley coming up behind her
Wesley: "You haven't an enormous amount of time." 
Xander:  "Hey it's Mr. States-the-Obvious." 
Buffy:  "The council is not welcome here.  I have no time for orders.  If I need someone to scream like a woman I'll give you a call." 
Wesley comes to stand next to her
Wesley: "I'm not here for the council.  Just tell me how I can help."  
Buffy looks up at him. 
Cordelia:  "That is so classy!  Isn't he just so classy?" 
(looks around at the others)
Buffy:  "It's a start." 
Wesley:  "So there is something I can do… besides scream like a woman." 
(Get up off her chair) 
Buffy:  "There is plenty.  There is chores for everyone.  Okay, this is…" 
Cut to the Mayor speaking to his hench-vamps
Mayor:  "…how it's going to lay out.  The transformation should begin at exactly 3:28.  I'll just be finishing my speech - you know, it's too bad you fellows have to miss that, because I think it speaks to everyone of us.  I mean, heck, I've been working on it for a hundred years.  It better be good.  (laughs)  They'll try to run, of course, and this is when I'll need you boys in flanking position." 
Vampire:  "But Sir, the sun!" 
Mayor:  "Not a problem."  
Blends into the library and Wesley reading
Wesley: "Darkness will follow and day becomes night." 
Buffy stands next to him with her arms crossed
Buffy: "An eclipse." 
Wesley:  "Standard procedure for an ascension?" 
Angel steps up to them
Angel: "That puts me back into the game." 
Buffy:  "Yea, it does.  You and Xander are going to have to work together now.  Can you guys handle that?" 
Neither one of them looks precisely overjoyed at the prospect. 
Xander:  "But I'm still key-guy, right?"  
Buffy: "Right."  
Xander:  "Then Angel, - in his non key-guy capacity, - can work with me." 
Angel:  "What fun." 
Xander:  "Hey!  Key-guy is still talking…" 
Buffy:  "Oh, that's good!  Start bickering.  That's going to look great for us."
Buffy walks past them towards the steps
Buffy:  "You guys are like little old ladies!" 
Cut to the Mayor pointing at a map
Mayor: "You come up through the sewers here.  The important thing is containment.  I'll need to feed.  It's crucial in the first few minutes to sustain the change.  What does that mean?  (shakes his finger at them)  No snacking.  I see blood on your lips, it's a visit to the wood shed for you boys.  Kill.  Don't feed." 
Cut to Buffy coming to look over Oz' and Willow's shoulders as they are looking through some books on the table of the library.  
Buffy:  "So, how are we coming on vulcano detail?" 
Oz:  "I think we can work it out." 
Willow:  "Fun with chemistry." 
Buffy:  "Xander said he should be able to get the materials." 
Oz:  "Who's going to stoke it up?" 
Buffy turns to Giles coming up beside them
Buffy: "You feel up to it?" 
Giles taking off his glasses
Giles: "Ah, I suppose it should be I.  It's strangely fitting in a grotesque fashion." 
Buffy:  "Okay guys, start reaching out.  Giles weapons, weapons, weapons."  
Starts walking out. 
Giles:  "Ah, what about you?" 
Buffy:  "There is something I have to get." 
Mayor:  "Remember: fast and brutal.  It's going to be a whole new world come nightfall, don't want to weaken now.   (the vampires start leaving his office)  And boys? - Let's watch the swearing." 
Cut to Xander walking into a classroom where Harmony is talking with two other girls. 
Xander takes her by the arm
Xander: "Harmony, listen, I need to talk to you for a second." 
Harmony:  "You mean in front of other people?"  
Xander grimaces and pulls her out of the room. 
Cut to Percy wearing his graduation gown
Percy: "Are they serious?  I'm going to look stupid in this!" 
Willow comes up behind him
Willow: "Percy!" 
Percy turns to her
Percy: "Do I look stupid in this?  Be honest." 
Willow:  "You look great.  You got a sec?" 
Cut to Wesley and Cordelia putting books into boxes in the library.  The glance at each other a couple of times when the other isn't looking, but continue packing. 
Wesley straightens up and says firmly
Wesley: "Cordelia." 
Cordelia spins around to face him
Cordelia: "Yes." 
Wesley:  "You know that… when this is over…"  
Cordelia:  "Yes." 
Wesley:  "uhm, well, should we prevail… I'll be going back to England." 
Cordelia turns back to the shelf and take down another book
Cordelia:  "I know." 
Wesley shifting awkwardly
Wesley: "With Buffy no longer working for the council, there really is… no place for me here." 
Cordelia turns back around and steps closer to him
Cordelia:  "I guess not." 
Wesley takes a step towards her clasping his hands in front of him
Wesley:  "No… reason to stay."  
Cordelia inches closer
Cordelia:  "No."  
Wesley inches close as well
Wesley: "No.  No… cause to hope that…"
(takes off his glasses while Cordy looks down)
Wesley: "I might be needed?"  
Cordy looks up at him
Cordelia:  "Needed?"  
Wesley:  "Or… wanted…"  
Cordelia:  "Wanted…" 
Wesley takes a deep breath and leans down to kiss Cordy putting his hands behind his back.  Cordy puts a hand on his shoulder and tries to kiss him.  They bump noses and juggle awkwardly.  Wesley waves his hand s around in the air beside Cordy.   Cordy tries to wrap her arms around his back to pull him (unsuccessfully) closer.  They maneuver around a bit more then pull back to look at each other breaking apart.  Cordy looks to the side and wipes her mouth.  They try again but with about as much success.  They break back apart and Cordy sighs in frustration and disappointment.  She wipes her mouth again and looks back up at him taking a deep breath
Cordelia:  "Good look in England." 
Wesley nods and puts his glasses back on
Wesley: "Yes, uhm, I'll drop you a line some time." 
Cordy smiles at him
Cordelia: "That'll be neat." 
Wesley smiles back at her
Wesley:  "Yes, hmm…" 
Wesley wipes his mouth as they turn away from each other and go back to packing up the books.

Cut to Larry and Jonathon taking sacks of fertilizer (?)  from Oz and Willow out of Oz's black van and putting them into a shopping cart. 
Oz:  "Okay, put these with the others.  Don't touch anything." 
Jonathon:  "Uh, wha… what do we do then?" 
Oz:  "Nothing." 
Willow:  "Just relax.  Have a good time." 
Jonathon:  "O… Okay." 
Larry:  "Okay, it's clear.  Lets move."  
Starts moving off with the shopping cart while Jonathon shuts the van's sliding door. 
Cut inside the van. 
Willow:  "I guess that's it.  Won't be long now." 
Oz:  "You nervous?" 
Willow:  "Only in a… terrified way." 
Oz takes her hand
Oz: "We'll make it through this." 
Willow:  "Are you sure?" 
Oz considers
Oz: "I sound pretty sure, don't I?" 
Willow smiles
Willow:  "Yeah." 
Oz half smiles
Oz: "Then I must be sure." 
Willow frowns at him
Willow:  "Is that just a comforting way of not answering the question?" 
Oz blinks and almost shrugs.  Willow and oz lean forward and they kiss softly.  Oz puts his hand up to caress the side of her head.  They kiss some more. 
Willow pulls away just a little and slowly opens her eyes
Willow:  "How long till graduation?" 
Oz:  "A little while." 
Willow moves to kiss him again.

Cut to Buffy walking into Giles office where Angel is sorting through weapons.  When she sees Angel she hesitates for a moment, then continues in. 
Angel with out turning around to see who came in
Angel: "Did you get what you needed?" 
Buffy coming up next to him
Buffy:  "Yeah, I did."
Buffy looks at the weapons
Buffy: "This isn't going to be enough." 
Angel still looking down at the stuff on the table
Angel: "Giles is on it."
(as Buffy turns and starts to leave he turns and asks quickly)  
Angel: "How are you?" 
Buffy stops and slowly turns towards him avoiding his eyes she says quietly
Buffy: "I heal fast.  Like you."  
then louder
Buffy: "So, are we sure that everyone knows what their position…" 
Angel interrupts her looking down at the table, quietly
Angel:  "I'm not going to say good-bye."  
Buffy looks up at him with a frown, which slowly dissolves.  Angel glances up at her, looks back down, swallows then looks back up
Angel: "If we get through this… I'm just going to go." 
Buffy slowly looks down. 
Angel:  "You understand?"
(Buffy nods slightly and swallows hard)  
Angel: "There is just too much to…"  
Buffy puts up a hand to stop him.  Angel hesitates a moment then puts down the crossbow bolt he has been playing with and turns to leave quietly.  Buffy takes a slow breath then looks down at her hands and unwraps the white cloth in her hand to reveal Faith's knife with some dried blood still coloring the blade.

Cut to the quad and the student taking their seats.  The music stops and the students sit down. 
Snyder at the podium
Snyder:  "Congratulations to the class of 1999.  You all proved more or less adequate.  This is a time of celebration, so sit still and be quiet. Spit out that gum. - Please welcome our distinguished guest speaker Richard Wilkins the 3rd.  I saw that gesture.  You see me after graduation."  
Turns and claps. 
Cut to the students clapping and Willow and Oz running to take their places.  Willow sits down next to Buffy. 
Willow:  "Am I late?  To the fight?" 
The Mayor shakes Snyder's hand and steps up to the podium.  Smiles and takes out some cue cards. 
Mayor clears his throat and surveys the students
Mayor: "Well.  What a day this is! - Special day.  Today is our centennial the one hundreds anniversary of the founding of Sunnydale, and I know what that means to all you kids: not - a darn thing.  Because today something much more important happens. today you all graduate from high school.  Today all the pain, all the work, all the excitement is finally over.  And what's a hundred years of history compared to that?  You know what kids? …" 
Buffy:  "Oh my God.  He's going to do the entire speech." 
Willow:  "Man, just ascend already." 
Buffy:  "Evol!" 
Mayor:  "… for all of you it may be that there is a place in Sunnydale's history, whether you like it or not.  It's been a long road getting here.  For you… for Sunnydale.  There has been achievement, joy, good times,… and there has been grief.  There's been loss.  Some people who should be here today… aren't. But we are. - Journey's end.  And what is a journey?  Is it just… distance traveled?  Time spent? No.  It's what happens on the way, it the things that happen to you.  At the end of the journey you're not the same.  Today is about change. Graduation doesn't just mean your circumstances change, it means you do.  You ascend… to a higher level.  Nothing will ever be the same.  Nothing."  

He looks up.  Buffy and the other students look up to see the sun being totally blocked.  The Mayor flinches in pain.  Then swallows and continues his speech
Mayor: "And so as we look back on… on the events that brought us to this day" 
Buffy with her hat off
Buffy: "Come on." 
Mayor:  "We…"
(stops in pain again  all the students are watching tensely)  
Mayor: "we must all…"
(screams) (the students and the faculty look at each other uneasily)  
Mayor: "It has begun.  My destiny.  It's a little sooner then I expected I had this whole section on civic pride… But I guess we'll just skip to the big finish!" 

Buffy and Willow look at each other as the Mayor starts to grimace and stretch and grow.  His suit splits around him and Snyder is leaning back in his seat looking taken aback.  The Mayor suddenly transforms into a big snake-like demon with clawed mandibles surrounding its mouth.  It keeps growing, stretching higher as the faculty abandons their seats.  The students get up but stay in place staring up at the Mayor, who seems to stretch up above the roof of the school.

Part 5

The Students stare up as the parents in the back to panic and leave.  A group of vampires comes up the steps behind the students. 
Buffy:  "Now!" 
All the students take off their gowns revealing crosses, axes, and other assorted weaponry. 
Buffy:  "Flame units." 
Several students including Larry point flame throwers at the Mayor and start flaming him.  The Mayor sways above the students screaming.  Buffy nods at Xander. 
Xander:  "First wave! Fire!"
(a group of students including Willow aim cross bows loaded with lance points at the Mayor)  
The Mayor screams and sways then lunges down and swallows a student in the first row.  Buffy stares in shock, as some of the students start milling around. 
Snyder:  "This… this is simply unacceptable!"
Three up the students break and run right into the group of vampires waiting on the steps.  Oz looks over as they are quickly killed by the vampires. 
Oz turns back around
Oz:  "Xander?" 
Xander:  "Arm bow men Fire!" 
(Oz and some others pick up long bows and arrows.  The vampires slowly move up the steps as the kids lit their arrows on fire and take aim)
The students let fly a mass and several vampires are hit and turn into flaming dust.  Xander looks back at the students in front of the Mayor.  Jonathan comes flying through the air and lands on top some students knocking them down. 
Buffy:  "Fall back!" 
Xander:  "Fire!"

The students let fly with the fire arrows again and several more vampires get hit.  The vampires turn to leave only to find themselves confronted by another group of students led by Angel who is flanked by Percy and Wesley.  They look at each other for a moment then Angel's group attacks.  Angel starts beat up some vampires.  Wesley runs up and right into a vampires fist, falls on his back (ala clothes line trick).  Angel fights two or three vampires at once easily holding his own.  The flame units once more shoot fire at the Mayor.  Larry's flame thrower cuts out or jams and after a moment he put is down and takes up a lance.  The Mayor's tail whips around, throwing Larry up in the air.  He lands hard in front of the podium. 
Cut to Angel throwing some vampires around.  Cut to Buffy getting up on a chair and looking up at the Mayor.  Cut to 
Snyder:  "This is not orderly.  This is not discipline!"  
Cut to the Mayor's snake head whipping around.  Cut to Snyder talking to the Mayor
Snyder: "You're on my campus buddy!" 
Cut to view point of the Mayor looking down at Snyder.  
Snyder:  "And when I say I want quiet, I want…" 
Cut to the Mayor's head coming down and swallowing Snyder.  Buffy and Xander look on in horror. 
Buffy to the students around her
Buffy: "Fall Back!  Get back! Go!"  
Willow:  "Good luck!" then leaves. 
Buffy:  "Xander take 'em down." 
Xander pulls a stake out of his back pocket
Xander:  "Everyone: hand to hand!"
(Buffy reaches into her jacket)  
Xander: "Everyone!  Lets go!  Move!  Move!" 
Cut to Angel sending a vampire flying, then taking care of two others.  His group is driving the vampires back up the steps.  One of them turns around and yells
Vampire:  "Get the kids!"  
The other vampires turn to follow his lead only to find themselves confronted with a mass of armed and angry teenagers with baseball bats, crosses and stakes.  Harmony gets bit, but another girl starts whaling on her attacker with a bat.  Jonathon jumps a vampire and falls down the steps with him. 
Xander struggling with another vampire
Xander: "Right flank close in.  Close! Jason and Paul you guys are right flank!" 
Cut to Angel punching another two vampires.  Cut to Cordy staking a vampire coming at her in good form.  Cut to Oz moving down the steps.  Cut to Wesley still laying on his back lifting a hand and looking around. 
Wesley:  "How about some help here…"  
We see feet rushing past him.  Cut to students fighting. 
Cut to the Mayor's head swing in the air. 
Buffy:  "Hey!"
(holds Faith's knife in her right hand) 
Buffy: "You remember this?"
(Close on Buffy looking up at the Mayor)  
Buffy: "I took it from Faith.  Stuck it in her gut."
(Looks at the knife then back up at the Mayor)  
Buffy: "Just slid in her like she was butter."  
Cut to the Mayor gnashing his teeth and growling. 
Buffy:  "You want to get it back from me Dick?" 
Camera from Mayor's PoV  Buffy turns and runs into the school with the Mayor in pursuit. 
Cut to the hall  Buffy opens the door and runs in.  The Mayor barrels down the door and some of the surrounding wall as he pursues her.  Buffy keeps running towards the library while the Mayor tears through the school like a freight train.  Buffy runs into the library, vaults a banister looking back at the Mayor.  The Mayor looks around the library and sees the barrels of diesel fuel and bags of fertilizer stacked everywhere.  Buffy keeps running and jumps out of a window.  Cut to the Mayor looking around and growling. 
Mayor (in his own voice that sounds like it is coming from the bottom of a rain barrel)
Mayor:  "Well, gosh."
Cut to Buffy crouching down next to Giles who pushes down the plunger.  Cut to a fire cloud erupting from the top of the school.  Cut to Xander and Angel looking up at the explosion.  Cut to some more explosions erupting from the school.  Cut to Percy laying on the steps looking up at them.  Cut to Jonathon protectively wrapping his arms around a girl as he looks at another explosion.  Cut to more explosions erupting all along the school.  Cut to Buffy and Giles nest to the plunger.  Close on Buffy staring then looking over at Giles. 
Cut to police cars and fire trucks parked in front of the school.  The air is dark and smoky.  We see two fire men wheeling a gurney with a groaning Wesley over towards an ambulance. 

Wesley:  "If I could… could just get something for the pain.  It's rather a lot of pain, actually.  Aspirin?  If you would… uh… ah…"
(The fire men start sliding the gurney into the ambulance)  
Wesley: "Perhaps I could just be knocked unconscious."  
More groaning as they slide him into the ambulance.  Pan to Xander and Buffy walking by.  Xander watches Wesley being put in the ambulance.  Buffy keeps looking around her. 
Xander:  "We got off pretty cheap… considering." 
Buffy still looking around
Buffy:  "Seems like we did." 
They walk a few more steps then Buffy stops still looking around.  Xander stops beside her his hands buried in his pockets. 
Xander:  "He made it through the fight."
(Buffy whips around to look at him)  
Xander: "Guess maybe he took off after."  
Buffy blinks and looks down.  Xander makes a grimace then turns and walks away.  Buffy stand there, again looking around, and Giles comes up to her. 
Giles puts a hand on her shoulder
Giles:  "Are you all right?" 
Buffy lays her head to one side
Buffy: "I'm tired." 
Giles smiles
Giles:  "I should imagine so.  It's been quite a couple of days." 
Buffy tiredly
Buffy:  "I haven't processed everything yet.  My brain isn't really functioning on the higher levels. It's pretty much fire bad; tree pretty." 
Giles shakes his head
Giles: "Understandable.  Well, when it's working again congratulate it on a good campaign.  You did very well." 
Buffy nods
Buffy:  "Thank you.  I will." 
Giles puts his glasses on
Giles:  "I ah… I managed to ferret this out of the wreckage.  Now, it may not interest you, but…"
(reaches into his jacket and pulls out a high school diploma)
Giles:  "I'd say you earned it."  
Hands it to Buffy who looks at it and takes it. 
Giles taking a deep breath and looking around
Giles:  "There is a certain dramatic irony that's attached to all this.  A Synchronicity that borders on… on predestination, one might say." 
Buffy:  "Fire bad; tree pretty.' 
Giles:  "Yes, s…sorry. I'm going to see to Wesley, see if he's… is still… whimpering."  
Walks off and Buffy looks after him.  Suddenly she turns around a slight frown on her face.  Her eyes lock on something and her face clears.  Cut to Angel standing beside a fire truck looking at her.  Close on Angel's face.  Close on Buffy's face.  Both just staring at each other.  Buffy blinks and her face falls.  She hugs herself a little closer.  Close on Angel, first obscured by some firemen walking by, then by a cloud of smoke.  The smoke blows by and he steps back, slowly turns around and walks off.  Cut to Buffy watching him leave.  Cut to Angel disappearing into the smoke.

Cut to Willow sitting on a stone bench in front of the school, Xander sitting beside her on the ground and Oz standing behind her.  Cordelia come walking up to them. 
Cordelia:  "Well, that’s the most fun you can have without having any fun." 
Willow:  "How about the part where we kicked some demon ass."
  (Oz strokes her hair from behind)  
Willow: "I didn't hate that." 
Xander:  "Hear, hear!" 
Buffy come walking up
Buffy: "You guys want to take off?  I think we've done pretty much all we can." 
Cordelia raises her eyebrows and nods
Cordelia:  "I'm for it." 
Willow looks up at Buffy
Willow:  "Are you okay?" 
Buffy nods and says in a small voice
Buffy:  "Yeah… I'm okay. - I could use a little sleep though." 
Willow nods and agrees emphatically
Willow: "Yeah." 
Buffy sits down on the bench next to her
Buffy:  "If someone could just wake me when it's time to go to college, that'd be great." 
Willow smiles at her. 
Oz his hands in his pockets
Oz: "Guys take a moment to deal with this: - we survived."  
Xander nods. 
Buffy:  "It was a hell of a battle!" 
Oz:  "Not the battle high school." 
They all look quietly at the school and listen to the crickets chirping. 
Oz:  "We're taking a moment"
  (Willow and Buffy get up from the bench.  Oz looks at Cordy)  
Oz: "and we're done." 
Xander get up and walks off next to Cordelia
Xander: "Well, School's done." 
Oz puts an arm around Willow as they all walk off together.  
Xander:  "It's ssso… Cool!" 
Willow:  "Why do demons even come here any more?  I mean, don't they know…" 
Camera pans down to show a maroon Sunnydale High 99 yearbook with the word 'The Future Is Ours' on it. 
Fade out.
