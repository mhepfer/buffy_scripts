PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>    Now, guys, look, we can settle this one of two ways. You can repaint the walls,     or I can suspend you and report this little incident on your permanent record."
PUNK #1,"<br>    Fine. Do that."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>    OK, I was bluffing. I hadn't really thought that one through. (leans forward)     Listen, this whole permanent record thing is such a myth anyway.

So, listen, I-I could suspend you, (stands, walks around desk) but     that would mean calling your parents, alerting your teachers, filling out     paperwork, and, quite possibly, having to talk to the school board&#151;(sits     on desk in front of them) all of which sounds positively exhausting to me.     No. No, I think it would be much easier if I just called the police, let them     deal with it.

DAWN,"<br>    Yeah, last night she was vomiting, and then this morning she was vomiting     some more, and then, just when we thought she was done, she was vomiting again.     (laughs)"
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>    Yeah, we got that stomach flu going around."
DAWN,"<br>    Her exact words were, &quot;I've got stuff coming out of both ends.&quot;"
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>    Thank you. That's very helpful."
DAWN,"<br>    (smiles) Sure. No problem. (to kids) Hey, guys. How's it going?"
PUNK #2,"<br>    Pretty good."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>    Um, tell your sister not to worry about it. We'll soldier on without her here.     Just, um, tell her to concentrate on getting better."
