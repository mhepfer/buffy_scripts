"1EXT.WOODS -     NIGHT<br>    A teenage girl is running through the woods at night, running for her life.     Bringers are chasing her. She sees an old pick-up truck driving down a dirt     road through the woods, and she runs in front of it, waving it down emphatically     with both arms. The driver slows and stops the truck; the girl goes to the     passenger door and speaks to him through the open window.","</p>  <p><b>MAN</b><br>  (wearing a black shirt with priest's collar, speaking in a southern drawl) What's   goin' on?"

BUFFY,"<br>  Hey."
CLEM,"<br>  Can you believe this mishegaas?"
BUFFY,"<br>  Yeah. You'd think these people had never seen an apocalypse before. (chuckles)   What about you? Just going for a quick spin to 7-Eleven... in Nebraska?"
CLEM,"<br>  It's getting bad here. Really bad. Hellmouth acting up again, people feeling   it, getting crazier. You can't swing a cat without hitting some kind of demonic   activity. Not that I swing cats, or eat&#151;nope. Heh. Cuttin' way back. Cholesterol&#151;morals.   I mean, morals."
BUFFY,"<br>  Right."
CLEM,"<br>  We've seen some bad stuff in this town before but, you know, this time, it's   like it just seems different, more powerful. (shakes his head) I don't think   anyone's gonna be able to stop it. (catches himself) I mean, I'm sure you'll   do fine. Complete confidence in you. Heh. Uh, if anyone can do it, you can,   because you...rock! If you save the world, I'll come back, we'll have drinks.   When. When, I mean. When you save the world. (Buffy nods) It's gonna be great   with all the... rocking. (sincerely) Maybe... maybe you should just get out   of town this time."

WILLOW,"<br>  (looking over at the man) Ow."
OFFICER,"<br>  Uh, people are acting up, getting nuts. Man, you just let us know if you need   help with your guy 'cause we are itching to hand out some justice."
WILLOW,"<br>  (looking back toward the man) He&#151;he doesn't seem like much of a threat."

BUFFY,"<br>  And that you should expect to see some bruising when you remove the bandages.   Bruising around the&#151; area. The, uh, bone structure and musculature was hit   pretty hard."
XANDER,"<br>  OK."
BUFFY,"<br>  Um, also they said that the&#151;the meds may cause you some stomach discomfort,   so we're gonna have to be careful with your diet."
XANDER,"<br>  I can't taste anything right now anyway. I keep waiting for my other senses   to improve 50%. Yeah, they should kick in any day now."
BUFFY,"<br>  (smiling) Well, we're looking at a possible release as early as tonight. Um,   we're just waiting for your labs to get back, and Dr. Kallet said that should   be a couple of hours."
XANDER,"<br>  That's great."
BUFFY,"<br>  (nods) OK. Um, I think we're all caught up then. (holding the files, to Willow)   Thank you for this. This was, um, really great work."

WILLOW,"<br>  (holding Xander's hand) So, I guess you're stuck with me then, huh? (tries to   sound chipper) Let's order some cherry-flavored off-brand gelatin, and then   I think we'll be up for a rousing game of&#151;"

XANDER,"<br>  Well, to go with the eye patch, to really complete the look. I think I still   have that costume from Halloween."
WILLOW,"<br>  Yeah, and don't underestimate the impact of a peg leg. Maybe the hospital can   hook you up with a nice one. Maybe they have a 2-body-parts for the price of   one kind of deal."
XANDER,"<br>  Oh, you know what the best part is? No one will ever make me watch jaws 3-D   again."
WILLOW,"<br>  Yeah, and, (tries to smile) you'll never have to... (tries to stifle her tears   as they well up in her eyes, squeezes Xander's hand tighter)"

ANDREW,"<br>  (writing in red) Hard...to...kill."
ANYA,"<br>  But I have been out talking to some of my old contacts, and they've provided   some surprising bits of news. Yay for them! (Andrew draws a picture of an Ubervamp)   Uh...OK. For example, Ubervamps can be staked... right through the heart. Zing&#151;poof.   (Andrew writes &quot;steak&quot; then crosses it out and writes &quot;stake&quot;   beside it) Just like regular vamps. Um...we didn't know this. (Andrew draws   a red arrow from the word &quot;stake&quot; to the torso of his Ubervamp drawing)   Of course, these guys have incredibly strong sternums, so it's a lot like driving   a wooden stake through solid steel. But you guys are all super-strong, right?"
KENNEDY,"<br>  (scoffs) Um...no."
ANYA,"<br>  Right. OK. Um... but still, heart information, still good to know since holy   water seems to run off these guys like they've been scotch-guarded. And, well,   sunlight would work, but guess what&#151; they're not coming out during the daytime.   (Andrew flips to a clean sheet of paper and draws a yellow smiling sun) Uh,   also, beware of their, uh, teeth and the claws they use to shred flesh. (Anya   holds up her hand, fingers spread, like she's clawing and shredding with her   hand; Andrew writes &quot;teeth, claws&quot;)"
RONA,"<br>  OK, you know what? I used to be really afraid of these Ubervamp guys. But then   the scary preacher blew into town, and now I'm mostly terrified of him."
ANYA,"<br>  (flips her note cards) Right, well, um... we're working on getting info on that   guy."
AMANDA,"<br>  Why bother? Nothing works. Nothing will."
ANYA,"<br>  (shuffling her note cards) OK... I know you're all upset... and I, myself, would   much rather be sitting at the bedside of my one-eyed ex-fiance than killing   time here with you people in this over-crowded and might I add increasingly   ripe-smelling basement. And I would be, too, if not for a certain awkward discussion   he and I recently had right over there on that cot immediately following some   exciting and unexpected breakup sex. (some of the girls seem grossed out and   move off the cot; Andrew writes &quot;breakup sex&quot; on the paper, underlining   it) But...I need to give him some space... so I'm doing what I can do, contributing   any way I can... and so will all of you. You still need to know this information.   We can't stop just because something else is trying to kill you, too."

KENNEDY,"<br>  (takes some chips) Probably. (hands the bag back to Faith)"
FAITH,"<br>  All right. Playin' hooky. Score one for the boarding school brat. Anya's technique's   probably a little different than what you're used to."
AMANDA,"<br>  (walks upstairs from the basement into the kitchen) Do you think there are gonna   be questions about her sex life on the test? 'Cause I really hope I don't have   to study all that."
FAITH,"<br>  Yeah. (grins) Whenever she starts talking about getting all sweaty with Xander   like that I just remind her I had him first. Shuts her right the hell up."
KENNEDY,"<br>  Thing is&#151; what's the point? Studying demon hot zones and pressure points doesn't   do a hell of a lot of good when preacher man's out there, ready to finish the   job he started."

BUFFY,"<br>  Yeah. I figure we start with California. We don't find anything there, we'll   expand the search. But a guy like Caleb didn't just get in the game. He's been   playing for a while, and I wanna know where. Whatever it takes. (to Dawn) You   good to help?"
