character,dialogue
Angelus,Daniel. Where were you going?
Daniel,(afraid) You! You're not human.
Angelus,"(agreeably) Not of late, no."
Daniel,(begs) Wh-what do you want?
Angelus,"Well, it happens that I'm hungry, Daniel, and seeing as that  you're somewhat in me debt..."
Daniel,"(frightened) Please, I can't!"
Angelus,"A man playing at cards should have a natural intelligence or a  great deal of money, and you're sadly lacking in both."
Angelus,So I take me winnings me own way.
Daniel,"(looking up, terrified) The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not  want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures..."
Angelus,"(interrupts) Daniel, be of good cheer. It's Christmas!"
Weatherman,"It's going to be sunny and warm with temperatures  continuing in the high 70s (about 25C) throughout the holiday weekend.  Just a little warm to light the Yule log, but it should make for a very  nice Christmas."
Santa,Merry Christmas!
Angel,Hi.
Buffy,Angel...
Buffy,"So, are you shopping? (realizes how silly that sounds) You're  probably not shopping."
Angel,I couldn't sleep.
Buffy,"Vampires probably not that big on Christmas, now that I think  about it."
Angel,Not as a rule.
Buffy,But you're good?
Angel,"I'm, I'm alright. You?"
Buffy,"Yeah! (smiles) Yeah, I'm good. I, um, (looks down at the boxes  she's carrying) I was just getting some Christmas gifts for the gang."
Buffy,"Um, I'd better go before the magic store closes."
Buffy,Angel?
Buffy,What is it?
Buffy,And then he just bailed. He didn't say anything. He just took  off. It was so weird.
Xander,Angel? Weird? What are the odds? (gets a look from Buffy)
Willow,Do you think something's wrong? Maybe you should tell Giles.
Buffy,No. I don't wanna bug Giles. He's still kinda twitchy when it  comes to the subject of Angel.
Xander,"Well, it must be that whole Angel-killed-his-girlfriend-and- tortured-him thing. Hey, Giles is pretty petty when it comes to stuff  like that."
Buffy,"Xander, enough, okay?"
Willow,Maybe Angel just has the holiday blues. Everybody gets 'em.  Especially when they're alone.
Buffy,"It's just so frustrating. I'm trying to do the right thing and  stay away from him and get over it, and then *boom*, there he is. I just  want a nice, quiet Christmas vacation."
Xander,"So, you doing anything special?"
Buffy,Tree. Nog. Roast beast. Just me and Mom and hopefully an excess  of gifts. What are you doing for Christmas?
Willow,"Being Jewish. Remember, people? Not everybody worships Santa."
Buffy,(smiles) I just meant for vacation.
Willow,Mm. Nothing fun.
Willow,Oz and I had planned... but I guess that's off.
Xander,"(with false heartiness) Well, I'll be enjoying my annual  Christmas Eve camp-out. See, I take my sleeping bag outside and I go to  sleep on the grass."
Willow,Sounds fun.
Xander,"Yeah, I like to look at the stars, you know? Feel the whole  nature vibe."
Cordelia,(smiling smugly) I thought you slept outside to avoid your  family's drunken Christmas fights.
Xander,Yes. And that was a confidence I was hoping you would share  with everyone. (smiles sarcastically)
Cordelia,"Well, I'll be in Aspen. Skiing. With actual snow."
Buffy,I hear that helps.
Cordelia,"It must be a drag to be stuck here in Sweatydale, but I'm  thinking of you. Okay, I'm done."
Buffy,She certainly has reverted to form.
Willow,"It's not her fault. Mm, after what happened, we gotta cut her  some slack."
Xander,That's the Christmas spirit.
Willow,"Hello, still Jewish. Chanukah spirit, I believe that was?  Anyway, forgiveness is pretty much a big theme with me this year, 'cause  of the..."
Oz,Hey.
Willow,Hey. (looks at him hopefully)
Oz,"Okay. The thing is... seeing you with Xander, it was... Well, I  never felt that way before... when it wasn't a full moon... but I know  you guys have a history."
Willow,"But it's a history that's in the past. Well, I-I guess most  history is in the past. But it's over."
Oz,"Well, I don't know. I don't know that it... ever will be between  you two."
Willow,"(imploringly) Oz, please believe me."
Oz,"(looks at her) This is what I do know: I miss you. Like, every  second. Almost like I lost an arm, or worse, a torso. So, I think I'd be  willing to... give it a shot."
Willow,(stands up and smiles tentatively) Really?
Oz,(stands up and smiles) Yeah.
Willow,Do you want us to... to hug now? (looks at him hopefully)
Oz,"(smiles) Yeah, I'm good for that."
Shopper,"Take the other one, then."
Joyce,Do you wanna get one with snow on it? Be very Christmasy.
Buffy,I think those are just for display.
Joyce,"Oh. You know, honey, I was thinking. Maybe we should invite  Faith to spend Christmas Eve with us."
Buffy,I don't know. Faith and I don't really hang out. Or talk or make  eye contact lately.
Joyce,(looks over another tree) Do you really wanna let her spend  Christmas Eve all by herself in that dingy little motel room?
Buffy,"(smiles) You're still number one with a guilt trip, Mom."
Joyce,I try.
Buffy,(gives in) I'll ask her.
Joyce,You're a doll.
Buffy,"What about Giles? I mean, he doesn't have any fam..."
Joyce,"(interrupts) No, I'm sure he's fine."
Buffy,We could at least ask him and see...
Joyce,He doesn't wanna spend Christmas Eve with a bunch of girls.  (takes a deep breath) Let's split up.
Buffy,"No, thank you."
Joyce,"(from a distance) Oh, honey, this one's perfect!"
Faith,Yeah?
Faith,"Hey, what's up? (to the TV) Work, damn it!"
Buffy,(closes the door) Hey.
Faith,What's going on? Scary monsters?
Buffy,"No. Um, (steps further in) we're having Christmas Eve dinner at  my house, and I thought that, um, if you didn't have plans..."
Faith,"(smiles sharply) Your mom sent you down, huh?"
Buffy,(taken aback) No.
Faith,"Well, thanks, but I got plans. There's this big party I've been  invited to. It should be a blast. (smiles evasively)"
Buffy,"(unconvinced) Okay. Cool. But if you change your mind, the  offer..."
Faith,"That's nice of you. Thanks. But I got... I got that big party  that I've been invited to, so... (smiles dismayingly)"
Buffy,(quietly approving) I like the lights.
Faith,"Yeah. Well, 'tis the season. Whatever that means."
Giles,Just a minute!
Giles,Hello.
Angel,Um... I'm sorry to bother you.
Giles,Sorry. Coming from you that phrase strikes me as rather funny.  'Sorry to bother me.'
Angel,I need your help.
Giles,(straight-faced) And the funny keeps on coming.
Angel,"(swallowing his pride) I understand I have no right to ask for  it, but there's no one else."
Giles,Alright.
Angel,I... I can't come in unless you invite me.
Giles,I'm aware of that.
Giles,Come in.
Angel,"I've been seeing... (distracted) I've... I've had dreams lately  about the past. It's... It's like I'm living it again. It's, it's so  vivid, I... I need to know. (pleading) I need to know why I'm here."
Giles,Here? Back on Earth?
Angel,I should be in a demon dimension suffering an eternity of  torture.
Giles,I don't feel particularly inclined to argue with that.
Angel,"But I'm not. I was freed, and I don't understand why."
Giles,Knowing why you were back would give you peace of mind?
Angel,It might.
Giles,You think that's something you ought to have?
Giles,"Because, sir, to be blunt, the last time you became complacent  about your existence turned out rather badly."
Giles,What?
Angel,Don't you see her?
Giles,Who?
Angel,I can't!
Margaret,"(nervous) Sir, please, I should return to the party."
Angelus,"Margaret, Margaret, there's no hurry."
Margaret,(trying to pull away) Mistress will be wondering...
Angelus,Shh. Mistress will be wondering how to get the good Reverend  Chalmers into bed and will not notice the absence of canape'. (strokes  her chin) Stay with me.
Margaret,"(worried) Sir, people might talk. I'll be put out in the  streets. My little boy would... I can't lose this job."
Angelus,(grabs her firmly) Then you must keep quiet.
Margaret,You're hurting me!
Angelus,Ah! Cry out. Call for help. I'm sure Mistress will believe  your behavior beyond reproach. (sneers)
Margaret,Please!
Angelus,"(shakes her) Come, make a scene, huh? Shall *I*?"
Margaret,(thinks better of it) No.
Angelus,"No, no. We'll be as quiet as mice."
Angelus,No matter what.
Margaret,(terrified) Sir! My son!
Angelus,"Oh, he'll make a fine dessert, huh?"
Jenny,(with false sympathy) Trouble sleeping?
Angel,You're not here.
Jenny,(slowly comes closer) I'm always here.
Angel,Leave me alone.
Jenny,I can't. You won't let me.
Angel,What do you want?
Jenny,"I wanna die in bed surrounded by fat grandchildren, but guess  that's off the menu."
Angel,(can't face her) I'm sorry.
Jenny,"You're sorry? For me? Don't bother. I'm dead. I'm over it.  (crouches down next to him) If you wanna feel sorry for someone, you  should feel sorry for yourself. Oh, but I guess you've already got that  covered."
Angel,I am sorry... for what I've done. What else can I say to you?
Daniel,I just want to show you who you are.
Giles,You had a dream about Angel.
Buffy,I was *in* Angel's dream.
Giles,(takes off his glasses) I'm not sure that's...
Buffy,"Giles, there was stuff in this dream that I couldn't possibly  know about. It was Angel's past, he was dreaming it, and somehow I got  sucked in."
Buffy,There's something wrong with him.
Giles,I know. I've seen him. He wanted to know why he was back.
Buffy,Is there a way for us to find that out?
Giles,"Uh, possibly. I-I've been looking. (puts his glasses back on)"
Buffy,"Well, let me look, too."
Buffy,"I'm not seeing him anymore. I'm trying to put all this behind  me, and I'm not gonna be able to as long as we're both doing guest spots  in each other's dreams."
Buffy,So we'll help him?
Giles,(realizes he has no choice) Yes.
Xander,(walks into the office) Where do we start?
Xander,"(abashed) Look, I'm aware I haven't been the mostest best  friend to you when it comes to the whole Angel thing, and, um, I don't  know, maybe I finally got the Chanukah spirit."
Giles,"(stands up) Well, we start, not surprisingly, with research.  (goes to a small bookcase) Xander, um, (hands him a book) the Black  Chronicles. And, uh, Buffy, (hands her a book) the diary of Lucious  Temple, an acolyte of Acathla, expert on demons. You can skip the  passages on his garden unless you're keen on growing heartier beets."
Buffy,Are you sure this is how you wanna spend your Christmas  vacation?
Xander,"Yeah, this is actually the most exciting thing I've got  planned. Who else can claim that pathetic a social life?"
Willow,"(walks in smiling) Hey, guys. What are we doing?"
Willow,He's gonna come over on Christmas Eve 'cause my parents are out  of town. We're gonna watch videos.
Buffy,"That's good, right? (they exchange a look) You guys are back."
Willow,"It's good. It's perfect. In an awkward, uncomfortable sort of  way. (Buffy gives her a sympathetic look) I just don't know how to make  Oz trust me."
Buffy,Xander has a piece of you that Oz just can't touch. I guess now  it's just about showing Oz that he comes first.
Willow,"(considers that) I guess. Thanks. (reads) Hey, he likes beets."
Buffy,I read that one already. (sighs) We're not getting any closer.
Businessman,"The thing I remember most was thinking how artful it was.  In the dark, they looked just like they were sleeping. It wasn't until I  bent down and kissed them good night that I felt how cold they were. You  grabbed me, and I thought, (faces Angel) who would go to so much trouble  to arrange them like that?"
Margaret,"But you see, that's what makes you different than other  beasts. They kill to feed, but you took more kinds of pleasure in it  than any creature that walks or crawls."
Angel,"Oh, God!"
Margaret,"(mocking him) Yeah, cry out. Make a scene."
Daniel,"I was to be married that week, but then, as I recall, you knew  that."
Angel,It wasn't me.
Jenny,It wasn't you?
Angel,A demon isn't a man. I was a man once.
Jenny,"(derisively) Oh, yes, and what a man you were."
Margaret,"A drunken, whoring layabout, and a terrible disappointment to  your parents."
Angel,I was young. I never had a chance to...
Margaret,To die of syphilis? You were a worthless being before you  were *ever* a monster.
Angel,Stop it! Stop...
Jenny,"I don't wanna hurt you, Angel, but you have to understand.  Cruelty's the only thing you ever had a true talent for."
Angel,That's not true.
Jenny,"Shh. (leads him to the coffee table) Rest. (gently gets him to  lie down) Rest. (walks around him) You mistake it for a curse, Angel,  but it's not. It's your destiny."
Jenny,I'll show you. I'll show you.
Jenny,You want her?
Angel,(panting) No.
Jenny,"(insistently) Take her. Take what you want. Pour all that  frustration and all that guilt into *her*, and you'll be free."
Angel,No.
Jenny,You can't live for eternity with *all that pain*. This is what  you are. This is why we brought you back. Take her! And then you'll be  ready... (moves in to his ear) ...to kill her.
Giles,"Here, Buffy. Take a look."
Giles,"These letters contain references to a, a, an ancient power known  as The First."
Buffy,First what?
Giles,"Evil. Absolute evil, older than man, than demons. It could have  had the power to bring Angel back."
Buffy,"These guys, (picks up one of the letters with sketches of the  eyeless priest) I-I saw them in my dream. I, I fell asleep up there."
Giles,You had another dream? With Angel? (Buffy nods) What happened?
Buffy,"(evasively) Oh, we don't need to get sidetracked. Who are these  guys?"
Giles,"Um, they're known as the, uh, (sits) as the Bringers o-o-or  Harbingers. They're high priests of The First. They, uh, they can  conjure spirit manifestations and set them on people, influence them,  haunt them."
Buffy,These are the guys working the mojo on Angel?
Xander,We gotta stop them.
Giles,"Y-you can't fight The First, Buffy. It's not a-a physical being."
Buffy,"Well, I-I can fight these priest guys."
Xander,If we can find them.
Willy,"(loudly so everyone hears) Hey! It's the Slayer. What brings  the, uh, Slayer down here?"
Buffy,"(goes up to the bar) Hey, Willy, how you been?"
Willy,"(pours a drink for a customer) Keeping out of trouble, as God is  my witness. (comes over to them) So, w-what can I do for you? Couple of  drinks?"
Xander,"Yeah. Let me get a double shot of, um... (exchanges a look with  Buffy) (aggressively to Willy) of information, pal."
Buffy,Three priests. They call themselves...
Xander,(interrupts) The Bringers.
Buffy,"(shoots Xander a look) Bringers, Harbingers. They have a 'no  eyes' kinda look."
Willy,Doesn't ring a bell.
Xander,(menacingly) How about I ring that bell for you? (hopefully to  Buffy) Does the threatening come now?
Buffy,Maybe you shouldn't help. (to Willy) They would've come to town  recently. They'd be holed up somewhere summoning the spirit of The  First.
Willy,"Well... I heard a few things, you know, from the underground."
Xander,The underground?
Willy,"Yeah, you know. From things that live under the ground.  Apparently there's been a lot of migration out of Sunnydale from the  lower inhabitants. Something's scaring them off, and these are things  that aren't easily scared. Could be your priest guys are underground."
Buffy,Underground where?
Willy,(regretfully) I do not know.
Buffy,Okay. Thanks.
Xander,See you around.
Willy,"(to Xander) Hey. (Xander faces him) You did great, by the way. I  was very intimidated by you."
Xander,Really? (smiles)
Xander,(smiles widely) Thanks!
Buffy,(takes Xander's arm) Let's go. (leads him away)
Willy,"Hey, kid. (Buffy faces him) Merry Christmas."
Xander,"Man, is it hot. It was so nice and cool in there."
Buffy,"Yeah, a nice cool waste of time."
Xander,We know underground. That's a start.
Buffy,"Sure, in a town with fourteen million square miles of sewer."
Xander,"Plus a lot of natural cave formations and a gateway to Hell.  Yeah, this does resemble square one."
Buffy,I don't know what to do.
Xander,"I think right now the best plan is to deck the halls with  boughs of holly. Look, we'll catch the bad guys... sooner or later."
Oz,Willow? (closes the door) I got videos. (holds them up)
Willow,Hi. (pats the sofa next to her) Why don't you come s-sit down?
Lyrics,<I>I've heard people say that</I>
Lyrics,"<I>Too much of anything is not good for you, baby</I>"
Oz,"You ever have that dream where you're in a play, and it's the  middle of the play and you really don't know your lines, and you kinda  don't know the plot?"
Willow,"Well, we're alone, and we're together. I-I just wanted it to be  special."
Oz,How special are we talking?
Willow,"(a bit nervous) Well, you know, we're alone, and we're both  mature younger people, and, and so... w-we could... I-I'm ready to... w- with you. (whispers) We could do that thing."
Willow,Where are you going?
Oz,"No, I'm not going. Just a dramatic gesture. That's, that's pretty  special."
Willow,"(stands also) Oz, I-I wanna be with you. First."
Oz,I think we should sit down again.
Willow,Oz?
Willow,I-I'm ready.
Oz,"Okay. Well, don't take this the wrong way... but I'm not."
Willow,(confused) Are you scared? 'Cause I thought you had...
Oz,"(shyly) No, I have, but this is different. I mean, you look great.  You know, and, and you got the Barry working for you, and, and it's  all... good. But when it happens... I want it to be because we both need  it to for the same reason. You don't have to prove anything to me."
Willow,I just wanted you to know.
Oz,I know. (smiles) I get the message.
Joyce,There we go.
Buffy,Nothing like a roaring fire to keep away the blistering heat.
Joyce,"Oh, come on. It's lovely. Maybe I should turn the air  conditioning on."
Joyce,"So, angel's on top again?"
Buffy,(startled) What?
Joyce,(holds up an angel and a star) Angel or star?
Buffy,"Oh, uh... star. Star."
Faith,(uncertainly) Hey.
Buffy,Hi!
Faith,"Uh, looked like that whole party thing was gonna be kind of a  drag. (drops her eyes for an instant) I didn't really have anything...  You know."
Buffy,(sincerely) I'm glad you came.
Faith,(smiles) Uh... Here. (hands Buffy gifts)
Buffy,Why don't you come in from the entire lack of cold?
Faith,Mm.
Faith,"Uh, that one (points) is for your mom. They're pretty crappy."
Joyce,"Faith, you made it. (takes the gifts from Buffy) Oh, that is so  thoughtful."
Faith,"(smiles, embarrassed) They're crappy."
Buffy,"You know, I'm gonna go upstairs and get your gifts. Excuse me."
Joyce,"Uh, would you like some nog?"
Buffy,"Okay, Mom, don't touch yours, though, 'cause then you're gonna  know what it is."
Buffy,Angel.
Angel,Huh... Buffy.
Buffy,What is it?
Angel,"I gotta... I... look, I, uh, I had to see you, um..."
Angel,"I don't know, I... You shouldn't be..."
Buffy,Just tell me what's going on.
Jenny,She wants you to touch her. What are you waiting for?
Angel,You have to stay away from me.
Buffy,(bewildered) You came to see me to tell me that I can't see you?
Buffy,"Angel, something is doing this to you."
Buffy,"(worried and frightened) You just have to control it, okay? I-I  know that you're confused."
Angel,I think you're the one who's confused. I think you need to...
Jenny,She wants you to taste her. Think of the peace. You'll never  have to see us again.
Buffy,"(imploringly) Angel, how can I help you?"
Angel,Leave me alone!
Buffy,I just need you to stay with Mom in case he comes back. (makes  strides for the door)
Faith,"Yeah, I'll play watchdog. I don't really get it, though."
Buffy,I'll explain later. Everything. I promise.
Faith,(concerned) Watch your back.
Buffy,"Giles, we have to do something. Soon. Now."
Giles,I'm still not sure what.
Buffy,(desperate) Find me these priest guys. Find me something I can  pummel.
Giles,Let's not lose our heads.
Buffy,"Giles, he's slipping."
Buffy,(voice faltering) I think we're losing him.
Giles,"Look... (puts on his glasses) You realize if he... truly becomes  a danger, you may have to kill him. Again. Can you do that?"
Angel,I can't do it.
Jenny,You have to do it. (tauntingly) What else are you good for?
Angel,(panting hard) Get away from me!
Jenny,"(appears behind him) Couldn't you just... feel her? (leans close  to him) Couldn't you almost smell her skin? You never were a fighter,  Angel, don't start trying now. (steps away) Sooner or later you will  drink her."
Angel,I'll never hurt her.
Jenny,You were born to hurt her. (scornfully) Have you learned  nothing? As long as you are alive...
Angel,(flatly) Then I'll die.
Jenny,(pauses to consider) You don't have the strength to kill  yourself.
Angel,I don't need strength. I just need the sun to rise.
Jenny,You're not supposed to die. This isn't the plan.
Jenny,But it'll do.
Buffy,"'A child shall be born of man and goat and have two heads, and  The First shall speak only in riddles...' No wonder you like this stuff.  (closes the book) It's like reading The Sun."
Giles,(finds something) Yes. Ah.
Buffy,(looks up at him) Priests?
Giles,"Um... Yes, but, uh, more, more posturing, I'm afraid. Um,  (reads) 'For they are the Harbingers of death. Nothing shall grow above  or below them. No seed shall flower, neither in man nor...' (gestures  that it goes on and on) They're rebels and they'll never ever be any  good. Nothing specific about their haunts."
Buffy,Let me see that.
Buffy,(reads) '...the Harbingers of death. Nothing shall grow above or  below...'
Giles,What?
Buffy,"Alright, ten more minutes of chanting and then you guys have to  go to bed."
Buffy,(defiantly) You won't get Angel.
Buffy,"(loses her patience) Alright, I get it. You're evil. Do we have  to chat about it all day?"
Buffy,No.
Buffy,(dripping with sarcasm) Lemme guess. Is it... evil?
Buffy,Angel!
Buffy,Angel.
Angel,I bet half the kids down there are already awake. Lying in their  beds... sneaking downstairs... waiting for day.
Buffy,"(out of breath) Angel, please. I need for you to get inside. Th- there's only a few minutes left."
Angel,I know. I can smell the sunrise long before it comes.
Buffy,(anxiously and hurried) I don't have time to explain this. You  just have to trust me. That thing that was haunting you...
Angel,(interrupts) It wasn't haunting me. It was showing me.
Buffy,(confused) Showing you?
Angel,What I am.
Buffy,(insistently) Were.
Angel,And ever shall be. I wanted to know why I was back. Now I do.
Buffy,You *don't* know. Some great evil takes credit for bringing you  back and you buy it? You just give up?
Angel,"(harshly) I can't do it again, Buffy. I can't become a killer."
Buffy,Then fight it.
Angel,It's too hard.
Buffy,"(desperately) Angel, please, you *have* to get inside."
Angel,It told me to kill you. You were in the dream. You know. It told  me to lose my soul in you and become a monster again.
Buffy,I know what it told you. What does it matter?
Angel,"(raises his voice) Because I wanted to! Because I want you so  badly! I want to take comfort in you, and I know it'll cost me my soul,  and a part of me doesn't care."
Angel,"Look, I'm weak. I've never been anything else. It's not the  demon in me that needs killing, Buffy. It's the man."
Buffy,"You're weak. Everybody is. Everybody fails. Maybe this evil did  bring you back, but if it did, it's because it needs you. And that means  that you can hurt it."
Buffy,"(pleadingly) Angel, you have the power to do real good, to make  amends. (raises her voice) But if you die now, then all that you ever  were was a monster."
Buffy,"(begging frantically) Angel, please, the sun is coming up!"
Angel,Just go.
Buffy,I won't!
Angel,"What, do you think this is simple? You think there's an easy  answer? You can never understand what I've done! Now go!"
Buffy,You are not staying here. (grabs his arm) I won't let you!
Angel,I said LEAVE!
Angel,"(quietly to himself) Oh, my God..."
Buffy,No! No!
Angel,"Am I a thing worth saving, huh? (shakes her) Am I a righteous  man? (shakes her) The world wants me gone!"
Buffy,(tearfully) What about me? I love you so much... And I tried to  make you go away... I killed you and it didn't help.
Buffy,"(crying) And I hate it! I hate that it's *so* hard... and that  you can hurt me *so* much. (sobs, then harshly) I know everything that  you did, because you did it to me. Oh, God! I wish that I wished you  dead. I don't. (whispers) I can't."
Angel,"Buffy, please. Just this once... let me be strong."
Buffy,"Strong is fighting! It's hard, and it's painful, and it's every  day. It's what we have to do. And we can do it together."
Buffy,"(resolvedly) But if you're too much of a coward for that, then  burn. If I can't convince you that you belong in this world, then I  don't know what can. But do *not* expect me to watch. And *don't* expect  me to mourn for you, because..."
Weatherman,"And while most of Southern California is enjoying a balmy  Christmas, an extreme cold front has sprung up out of nowhere around  Sunnydale, where they are reporting heavy snowfall for the first time  in, well, ever."
Weatherman,"Sunnydale residents shouldn't expect to see the sun at all  today. That cold front isn't going anywhere. With temperatures in the  high 30s (about 3C), means you better bundle up if you're planning to go  outside and enjoy the change in the weather."
