Xander,"You know how I feel about you. It's, uh, pretty obvious, isn't  it? There's never been anyone else for me... but you. And we're good  friends, and it's time to take the next step."
Xander,"Would you, um... date me? Oh that's good! Date me! It's  terrible, right?"
Willow,"(comes back to earth) Huh? Oh, no! Oh, yes, 'date me' is  silly..."
Xander,"See, what I should do is I should just start with talking about  the dance. (clears his throat) Y'know, Buffy, Spring Fling just isn't  any dance. It's a time for students to choose, um... a mate and then we  can... observe their... mating rituals and tag them before they migrate.  Just kill me!"
Willow,You're doing fine!
Xander,"Why's it so hard? I should just walk up to her and say, 'Hey, I  like you. Let's go to the dance together.'"
Willow,Direct and to the point.
Xander,I'm ready. I wanna do it now. I *gotta* do it now.
Willow,"Oh, Buffy's not here. You can practice on me some more."
Xander,"No, no, I can't wait until tomorrow, I-I'll be thinking about  it too much. Why didn't Buffy show up tonight? What's she doing?"
Willow,"Oh, you know, the usual."
Cordelia,What was that?
Kevin,What was what?
Cordelia,Someone's out there.
Kevin,That's silly! Who would be out there?
Buffy,Three in one night. Giles would be so proud.
Giles,"Ho korias phanaytie toutay... tay nuktee. 'The Master shall  rise...' Yes, yes, this is it! 'The Master shall rise, and the  Slayer...' (looks up in disbelief) My God!"
Xander,Under the stairs! Under the stairs!
Master,"Yes! YES! Shake, Earth! This is a sign! We are in the final  days! My time has come! Glory! GLORY!"
Master,Whadaya think? 5.1?
Buffy,Morning!
Buffy,Wow. The damage looks fairly structural. Are we safe in here?
Giles,Buffy!
Buffy,What? Do I have something on my face? (pats her face)
Giles,"No! Uh, and, and yes, we're, we're safe. (indicates the stacks)  Uh, but probably best not to go up there."
Buffy,"How're you doin' there, Giles? Get much sleep last night?"
Giles,Um... I-I-I've been working.
Buffy,"Me, too. I went hunting last night, and it is awfully sweet of  you to ask. It's getting hairy out there, Giles. I killed three vampires  last night, and one of them was practically on school grounds."
Giles,Their numbers are increasing.
Buffy,"And they're getting cockier. Look, I'm not loving it. Last night  was a pretty close call."
Giles,(distracted) Yes.
Buffy,"Giles, care? I'm putting my life on the line battling the  undead. Look, I broke a nail, okay? I'm wearing a press-on. The least  you could do is exhibit some casual interest. You could go, 'hmm'."
Giles,"(still distracted) Hmm? Oh, sorry. Um, yes, I'm very glad that  you're alright. Uh, I-I need to verify, um... I just can't really talk  right now."
Buffy,Fine. That's okay. I can't put it off any longer. I have to meet  my terrible fate.
Giles,(turns around quickly) What?!
Buffy,Biology.
Buffy,(exhales) Wow. That was boring.
Xander,I don't feel that boring covers it.
Buffy,"No, boring falls short."
Willow,Even I was bored. And I'm a science nerd.
Buffy,Don't say that.
Willow,"I'm not ashamed. It's the computer age. Nerds are in. They're  still in, right?"
Xander,"Willow, don't you have a thing?"
Willow,A thing? (remembers) The thing! That I have! Which is... a  thing that I have to go to.
Willow,See ya later. (waves and departs)
Buffy,What on earth is her deal?
Xander,"Uh, she's Willow. (laughs) So, uh, Buffy, I wanted to, um...  There was this thing I wanted to ask you, to talk to you about."
Buffy,"Okay, what's up?"
Xander,"Uh, let's go over here and sit."
Buffy,"Okay, now you're making me nervous."
Xander,"Oh, no, no, there's nothing to be nervous about. Really, it's  silly. Ha, ha! (laughs nervously)"
Xander,(to the boy) Hey. (the boy looks up) Leave. (the boy leaves)  Thanks. (they sit)
Buffy,Well?
Xander,"Um... You know, Buffy, uh, Spring Fling is a... time for  students to gather and... Oh, God! (takes a breath) Buffy, I want you to  go to the dance with me. You and me, on a date."
Buffy,(speechless) I-I don't know what to say.
Xander,"Well, you're not laughing. So that's a good start. Buffy, I  like you. A lot. And I know we're friends, and we've had experiences...  We've fought some blood-sucking fiends, and that's all been a good time.  But I want more. I wanna dance with you."
Buffy,"Xander, you're one of my best friends. You and Willow..."
Xander,"Well, Willow's not looking to date you. Or if she is, she's  playing it pretty close to the chest. (laughs nervously)"
Buffy,I don't want to spoil the friendship that we have.
Xander,"Well, I don't want to spoil it either. But that's not the  point, is it? You either feel a thing or you don't."
Buffy,"(looks down a moment, then back up) I don't. Xander, I'm, I'm  sorry. I-I just don't think of you that way."
Xander,"Well, try. I'll wait. (smiles weakly)"
Buffy,Xander...
Xander,"Nah. Forget it. (gets up) I'm not him. I mean, I guess a guy's  gotta be undead to make time with you."
Buffy,That's really harsh.
Xander,"Look, I'm sorry. I don't handle rejection well. Funny!  Considering all the practice I've had, huh?"
Buffy,"Xander, I'm sorry, I don't know..."
Xander,You know what? Let's just not.
Giles,"Hello. Uh, this is Giles. Uh... Uh, Rupert Giles."
Giles,"(into the phone) I-I need to see you. No, I-I realize that.  Uh... Come after sundown. Good. I'll see you then. (hangs up)"
Giles,"Sorry, uh... I'm not really up to, uh, socializing just now."
Giles,(turns around and gets up) What do you know?
Giles,I don't know if I can trust you.
Giles,The Anointed One? He's dead!
Giles,"Uh, who is this monk?"
Giles,"I need you to talk to him, find out everything he knows."
Giles,Just do it! I'll e-explain later.
Kevin,I'll get everything tonight after practice. The guys'll help me.
Cordelia,"Well, it's all in the A-V room. The sound system, and the  decorations... And, oh, Aura needs help, um, moving the coolers."
Kevin,Don't sweat it!
Cordelia,"Well, bring everything to the Bronze, and I'll meet you there  in the morning!"
Kevin,Done!
Cordelia,(giggles) You're so sweet! Why're you so sweet?
Kevin,I dunno! 'Cause I'm usually mean as a snake!
Cordelia,Willow! (to Kevin) I'll see you in the morning.
Kevin,Okay. (leaves)
Cordelia,Willow! I really like your outfit!
Willow,"No, you don't."
Cordelia,"No, I really don't, but I need a favor."
Willow,What kind?
Cordelia,"Well, the Bronze won't let us use their sound system, and I  need someone who knows how to hook one up. If you could just show up  tomorrow morning..."
Cordelia,"...I'd be really, really grateful! I mean, I'd talk to you at  the dance and everything."
Willow,Sure. (looks back at Xander)
Cordelia,Great! Tomorrow at ten?
Willow,Sure.
Willow,Hey!
Xander,Hey! (throws the ball)
Willow,How'd it go?
Xander,(throws the ball) On a scale of one to ten? It sucked. (throws  the ball)
Willow,Oh.
Xander,"Well, I guess it could be worse. (throws the ball) I could have  gangrene on my face. (throws the ball)"
Willow,"Well, what'd she say?"
Xander,"Apart from 'no', does it really matter? She's still jonesin'  for Angel, and could care less about me."
Willow,At least now you know.
Xander,"Yeah, you're right. The deal's done. The polls are in, and it's  time for my concession speech. (has an idea and brightens) Hey, I know  what we'll do! We can go! Be my date! We'll, we'll have a great time!  We'll dance, we'll go wild... Whadaya say?"
Willow,No.
Xander,Good! What?
Willow,There's no way.
Xander,"(exhales) Willow, come on!"
Willow,You think I wanna go to the dance with you and watch you wish  you were at the dance with her? You think that's my idea of hijinks? You  should know better.
Xander,(exhales) I didn't think.
Willow,I'm sorry it didn't work out for you. I'll see you on Monday.  (leaves)
Xander,"That's okay. I don't wanna go. I'm just gonna go home, lie down  and listen to country music. The music of pain."
Buffy,"(to herself) Giles, you are not gonna believe this."
Giles,"It's clear. It's what's gonna happen. Uh, it's happening now!"
Buffy,Angel?
Angel,It can't be. You've gotta be wrong.
Giles,I've checked it against all my other volumes. It's very real.
Angel,"Well, there's gotta be some way around it."
Giles,"Listen. Some prophecies are, are a bit dodgy. They're, they're  mutable. Buffy herself has, has thwarted them time and time again, but  this is the Codex. There is nothing in it that does not come to pass."
Angel,Then you're reading it wrong.
Giles,"I wish to God I were! But it's very plain! Tomorrow night Buffy  will face the Master, and she will die."
Angel,"Well, have you verified the text?"
Buffy,"So that's it, huh? I remember the drill. One Slayer dies, next  one's called! Wonder who she is. (to Giles) Will you train her? Or will  they send someone else?"
Giles,"Buffy, I..."
Buffy,They say how he's gonna kill me? Do you think it'll hurt?
Buffy,Don't touch me! (to Giles) Were you even gonna tell me?
Giles,I was hoping that I wouldn't have to. That there was... some way  around it. I...
Buffy,I've got a way around it. I quit!
Angel,It's not that simple.
Buffy,"I'm making it that simple! I quit! I resign, I-I'm fired, you  can find someone else to stop the Master from taking over!"
Giles,I'm not sure that anyone else can. All the... the signs  indicate...
Buffy,The signs? (throws a book at him) READ ME THE SIGNS! (throws  another one) TELL ME MY FORTUNE! YOU'RE SO USEFUL SITTING HERE WITH ALL  YOUR BOOKS! YOU'RE REALLY A LOTTA HELP!
Giles,"No, I don't suppose I am."
Angel,I know this is hard.
Buffy,What do you know about this? You're never gonna die!
Angel,You think I want anything to happen to you? Do you think I could  stand it? We just gotta figure out a way...
Buffy,"I already did. I quit, remember? Pay attention!"
Giles,"Buffy, if the Master rises..."
Buffy,"(yanks the cross from her neck) I don't care! (calms down) I  don't care. Giles, I'm sixteen years old. I don't wanna die."
Lyrics,<I>I fall to pieces</I>
Lyrics,<I>Each time I see you again</I>
Lyrics,<I>I never knew what enough was</I>
Joyce,"Hi, honey. You alright?"
Lyrics,<I>Until I'd had more than my share</I>
Buffy,Sure.
Joyce,Probably just full from that bite of dinner you nearly had.
Lyrics,<I>I let the darkness in</I>
Joyce,Feel like telling me what's on your mind?
Lyrics,<I>And it was then I lost the dare</I>
Buffy,"(turns to her mom) Mom, let's go away! (smiles)"
Joyce,What?
Buffy,"Anywhere, just for a while, all weekend!"
Joyce,"Honey, I..."
Buffy,"No, it'll be great! You and me, a mother-daughter thing... We  can talk about all the embarrassing things you love to bring up."
Joyce,You know the gallery's open on weekends.
Buffy,"Mom, please!"
Joyce,"Isn't the Prom tomorrow night? Or Spring Fling, whatever they're  calling it?"
Buffy,I-I guess.
Joyce,Nobody asked you?
Buffy,"Oh, someone..."
Joyce,"But not the right someone. See, sometimes I actually do know  what you're thinking. (goes over to Buffy's closet) Well, then, uh, this  probably isn't the best time for this, but, uh..."
Joyce,I saw you eyeing it at the store. I figured...
Buffy,"(gets up) Mom, we can't afford this."
Joyce,"The way you've been eating, we can afford it."
Buffy,(comes over to look at it) It's beautiful.
Joyce,I think you should wear it. To the dance.
Buffy,"No, I-I can't go to the dance."
Joyce,"Says who? Is it written somewhere? You should do what you want.  Homecoming, my freshman year of college. I didn't have a date, so I got  dressed up and I went anyway."
Buffy,Was it awful?
Joyce,It was awful. For about an hour.
Buffy,Then what happened?
Joyce,(smiles) I met your father.
Buffy,He didn't have a date either?
Joyce,"He did. And that's a much funnier story that you will *not* get  to hear. Oh, but it was a beautiful night! (exhales)"
Buffy,And you had your whole life ahead of you.
Joyce,Yeah.
Buffy,Must be nice.
Cordelia,"Oh, Kevin said that he'd bring everything to the Bronze last  night. He promised! We'll never get everything ready in time."
Willow,He probably forgot. It's not *that* big a deal.
Cordelia,"Uh, you don't understand. I'm not mad! He totally flaked on  me. On me! And I don't even care. God help me, I think it's cute! Oh..."
Cordelia,There they are! They're watching cartoons. That's so cu...  That's not cute. That's annoying. I'm annoyed.
Willow,Right. I'm furious.
Cordelia,Men. I don't know why we put up with them.
Willow,I hear ya.
Cordelia,"Obviously, Kevin has underestimated the power of my icy  stare."
Cordelia,"(screams) Oh, my God! Kevin! (kneels by him) No!"
Cordelia,Kevin!
Joyce,Buffy?! There's something on the news. Willow.
Willow,I've seen so much.
Willow,"I thought I could take anything. But, Buffy, this... this was  different."
Buffy,It'll be alright.
Willow,I'm trying to think how to say it... to explain it so you  understand.
Buffy,It doesn't matter as long as you're okay.
Willow,"I'm not okay. I knew those guys. I go to that room every day.  And when I walked in there, it... it wasn't our world anymore. They made  it theirs. And they had fun. (a tear rolls down her cheek) What are we  gonna do?"
Buffy,"What we have to. (gets up and exhales) Promise me you'll stay in  tonight, okay?"
Willow,Buffy?
Willow,(smiles through her tears) I like your dress.
Buffy,Take care. (leaves)
Master,Soon.
Master,Soon!
Giles,"Yes. That about sums it up, yes."
Giles,"You know how to get in touch with this, uh, brother Luca chap?"
Giles,What did it say?
Giles,"'The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down  with the kid, the calf, the lion and the fatling together, and the  little child to lead them.'"
Giles,"Well, that depends where he's leading them to. Aurelius wrote of  the Anointed One, 'The Slayer will not know him, and he will lead her  into Hell.'"
Giles,"If the vampire that Buffy killed was in fact not the Anointed,  then it may well be."
Giles,I don't intend involving her at all.
Giles,Buffy's not gonna face the Master. I am.
Buffy,"No, you're not."
Buffy,"So, I'm looking for a kid, huh? And he'll lead me to the Master?"
Giles,"Buffy, I'm not gonna send you out there to die. Now, you were  right. I-I've waded around in these old books for so long, I've  forgotten what the real world is like. I-it's time I found out."
Buffy,You're still not going up against the Master.
Giles,I've made up my mind.
Buffy,So have I.
Giles,"I made up my mine first! I'm older and wiser than you, and  just... just do what you're told for once! Alright?"
Buffy,That's not how it goes. I'm the Slayer.
Giles,"I don't care what the books say. I defy prophecy, and I am  going. There's nothing you can say will change my mind."
Buffy,I know.
Buffy,"When he wakes up tell him... I don't know. Think of something  cool, tell him I said it."
Buffy,Maybe. (picks up the crossbow) Maybe I'll take him with me.
Collin,Help me...
Buffy,It's okay. I know who you are.
Xander,She what?
Willow,I told you there was something going on with her.
Xander,"And she knew about this prophecy of yours? (Giles nods) Aw,  man, what do we do?"
Giles,"We stay calm, first thing."
Xander,Calm?
Willow,I think he's right.
Xander,"I'm sorry, calm may work for Locutus of the Borg here,  (indicates Giles) but I'm freaked out, and I intend to stay that way."
Willow,Xander...
Xander,How could you let her go?
Giles,"As the soon-to-be-purple area of my jaw will attest, I did *not*  *let* her go!"
Willow,"Well, how can we help her?"
Xander,Do you mind?
Willow,How come she's in the club?
Xander,"Uh, uh, I don't care. I'm sorry, I don't. Right now I gotta  help Buffy."
Giles,We don't even know where she's gone.
Xander,No. But I can find out.
Angel,Oh. Look who's here.
Xander,Mind if I come in? (comes in)
Angel,(closes the door) Make yourself at home.
Xander,She's gone.
Angel,Whadaya mean?
Xander,"Buffy, she's gone to fight the Master."
Angel,He'll kill her.
Xander,Rumor has it. Only we're not gonna let it happen.
Angel,"Well, what do you propose we do about it?"
Xander,"Look, I know you can find this Master guy. He's underground,  right? Take me to him."
Angel,"You're way outta your league, kid. The Master'll kill you before  you can even breathe. If you're lucky."
Xander,How can I say this clearly?
Xander,"I don't like you. At the end of the day, I pretty much think  you're a vampire. (lowers the cross) But Buffy's got this big old yen  for you. She thinks you're a real person. And right now I need you to  prove her right."
Angel,You're in love with her.
Xander,Aren't you?
Giles,The Master is as old as any vampire on record. There's no  telling how powerful he'll be if he reaches the surface.
Giles,Yes.
Giles,"Good point. Uh, well, look, you have a look through the Black  Chronicles... (hands her one of the books)"
Giles,"Uh, Willow? Willow?"
Willow,Huh?
Giles,"(sits down at the table) Could you look through the local  histories, please. Check for any common denominators, uh, locations of  incidences and such."
Willow,"Right, okay."
Master,Welcome.
Buffy,Thanks for having me.
Buffy,"Y'know, you really oughtta talk to your contractor. Looks like  you got some water damage."
Master,"Oh, good. The feeble banter portion of the fight. Why don't we  just cut to the..."
Master,Nice shot.
Angel,(quietly) This way. (looks at Xander) What?
Xander,You were looking at my neck.
Angel,What?
Xander,You were checking out my neck! I saw that! (starts following)
Angel,"No, I wasn't!"
Xander,"Just keep your distance, pal."
Angel,I wasn't looking at your neck!
Xander,I told you to eat before we left.
Master,You're not going to kill me with that thing.
Buffy,Don't be so sure.
Master,"You still don't understand your part in all this, do you? You  are not the hunter. You are the lamb."
Giles,"Well, let's think about this, then. The vampires have been  gathering, they know he's coming, they will be his army."
Willow,"Well, the last time the Master tried to rise was the Harvest.  He sent a bunch of vampires to get him fresh blood."
Giles,The Bronze.
Willow,The Prom!
Giles,We have to warn them.
Giles,"Stay close together, and for goodness' sake, be careful!"
Willow,We will.
Buffy,"You know, for someone who's all powerful, you sure do like to  hide."
Master,I'm waiting for you. I want this moment to last.
Buffy,"Well, I don't."
Master,I understand.
Willow,What if they get to the Bronze before we do? (looks behind  them)
Willow,(catches up) Why not?
Master,"You tried. It was noble of you. You heard the prophecy that I  was about to break free and you came to stop me. But prophecies are  tricky creatures. They don't tell you everything. (whispers) You're the  one that sets me free! (gloats) If you hadn't come, I couldn't go.  (whispers) Think about that!"
Master,"Oh, God! The power!"
Master,And by the way...
Master,I like your dress.
Xander,What was that?
Angel,It's too late. He's gone up.
Angel,She's dead!
Xander,No. She's not dead.
Angel,She's not breathing.
Xander,"But if she drowned, uh, there's a shot! CPR!"
Angel,You have to do it. I have no breath.
Xander,C'mon. C'mon!
Willow,Not caring!
Cordelia,Get in!
Xander,C'mon! Breathe! Breathe!
Xander,C'mon!
Xander,Buffy!
Xander,Buffy.
Buffy,Xander?
Xander,Welcome back.
Cordelia,"I was sitting where Kevin and I used to park, and all of a  sudden these things are coming at me!"
Willow,We've gotta get to the library!
Cordelia,Library! Great!
Willow,"Of course, we generally walk there."
Giles,What the...
Giles,What's happening?
Giles,Why are they coming here?!
Master,"My world! Oh, my beautiful world!"
Xander,Easy. Easy.
Buffy,(standing now) The Master?
Angel,He's gone up.
Xander,No. You're still weak.
Buffy,"(stops) No. No, I feel strong. I feel different. (looks back at  them) Let's go!"
Giles,(points) They're coming in through the stacks!
Giles,My office...
Cordelia,Somebody help!
Xander,"So, how do you know where the Master's going?"
Buffy,I know.
Buffy,"Oh, look, a bad guy."
Buffy,"Okay, you two wait here, keep the rest of the vampires off me."
Xander,Right.
Buffy,"Angel, better put on your game face."
Angel,(vamped out) I'm ready.
Buffy,"One way or another, this won't take long."
Cordelia,See how *you* like it!
Willow,This won't keep 'em out for long!
Giles,The Hellmouth!
Master,"Yes. Come forth, my child. Come into my world."
Buffy,I don't think it's yours just yet.
Master,You're dead!
Buffy,"I may be dead, but I'm still pretty. Which is more than I can  say for you."
Master,You were destined to die! It was written!
Buffy,What can I say? I flunked the written.
Master,Come here!
Master,Did you really think you could best me here when you couldn't  below? (lets go of her neck)
Buffy,(looks at him curiously) You have fruit punch mouth.
Master,What?
Buffy,Save the hypnosis crap for the tourists.
Master,Where are your jibes now?
Master,You laugh when my Hell is on Earth?
Buffy,You're that amped about Hell... (grabs him by the neck) Go  there!
Giles,The vampires?
Cordelia,Gone.
Angel,The Master?
Giles,Dead. The Hellmouth is closed. Buffy... Buffy?
Buffy,"Oh, sorry. It's just been a really weird day. (smiles)"
Xander,"Yeah! Buffy died, and everything!"
Willow,Wow! Harsh.
Giles,I should have known that wouldn't stop you.
Giles,"I don't know about the rest of you, but I'd like to get out of  this place. I don't like the library very much anymore."
Xander,Hey! I hear there's a dance at the Bronze tonight. Could be  fun.
Cordelia,Yeah!
Willow,Buffy?
Buffy,"Sure! We saved the world. I say we party! (looks down at her  dress) I mean, I got all pretty."
Buffy,(looks at the Master) He's not going anywhere. Loser.
Giles,"(to Ms. Calendar) I'm not dancing, though."
Willow,"(to Angel) You can come with us, Angel."
Buffy,I'm hungry.
Xander,So what's the story with the car?
Cordelia,"Oh, that was me, saving the day!"
Willow,(to Angel) Get something to drink.
Buffy,Is anybody else hungry?
Willow,"(to Angel) Well, no, don't do that. Just hang."
Buffy,"I'm really, really hungry."
Angel,"By the way, I really like your dress."
Buffy,"Yeah, yeah. Big hit with everyone."
