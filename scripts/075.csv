Giles,Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer...
Willow,Oz... don't you love me?
Oz voiceover,The wolf is inside me... all the time.
Oz voiceover,"Until I figure out what that means, I shouldn't be around"
Buffy,"The Initiative created this thing and they can't stop it, but we will."
Riley voiceover,The implant works. Hostile 17 can't hurt any living
Spike in the Bronze,"I get this chip out, you and me are gonna have a"
Willow,I just like having something that's ... mine.
Tara,"I am, you know. Yours."
Episode begins,
TARA,Do you like cats?
WILLOW,"I'm more of a dog person myself. But I'm not like, ""death to all"
TARA,Cause I was thinking of getting one.
WILLOW,Can you have one in the dorms?
TARA,"No, but this would be a sneaky cat."
WILLOW,That would be cool. You mean it'd be sort of like a familiar?
TARA,"Actually, I-I was thinking it would be sort of like a pet. You know,"
WILLOW,And we could make kitty go bonkers with string and catnip and stuff?
TARA,Absolutely.
WILLOW,Fun! I'm in.
TARA,"So, you're not allergic or anything."
WILLOW,Nope.
TARA,"Good, cause ... I want my room to be Willow-friendly."
WILLOW,Me too.
TARA,So I'm excited about the Scooby meeting ... I think. What's it about?
WILLOW,I'm not sure. Probably just your garden-variety disaster.
BUFFY VOICE-OVER,Zippo.
BUFFY,Patrol's been totally uneventful. My kill count's way down.
WILLOW,(to Tara) She means there's been less bad-guy activity.
GILES,"Well, we know what that often indicates."
XANDER,Buffy doesn't make her quota. (Shakes finger at Buffy) Bad slayer!
GILES,"Well, I wish it were that innocuous, but with Adam around, I feel"
WILLOW,"(to Tara) When things get slow, it's usually because there's some"
RILEY,"Except the weird thing is, we've been busy at the Initiative. Our"
WILLOW,(to Tara) That's a metaphor.
TARA,"(smiling) I got it, thanks."
WILLOW,"I'm overhelping, aren't I?"
GILES,(coming out of kitchen with bowl) So the activity's shifted but not
ANYA,"To an extremely bored person, maybe."
ANYA,"Well, that was a thrilling hour."
GILES,"(rising) You know, I really don't appreciate your snide remarks, Anya."
GILES,"Now, I have a great deal of experience in these matters..."
GILES,"...and if I say there is a matter of some import brewing, I-I-"
OZ,Hey.
WILLOW,Oz.
TARA,(understanding) Oz.
WILLOW,"When, when did you get back?"
OZ,Pretty much now.
XANDER,"Oz, man. Hate to sound grandma, but... you don't call, you don't write."
OZ,"Yeah, sorry."
BUFFY,"So are you here here, or are you just passing through?"
GILES,"Well, um, let's not, uh, bombard the poor chap with, uh, questions"
OZ,"I'll pass, thanks."
OZ,"Look, I'm going to Devon's to see if he's got a place I can crash."
WILLOW,I guess so.
OZ,I'll come by your place?
WILLOW,Okay.
OZ,It's great to see you guys again. Really.
ANYA,Everyone's uncomfortable now.
BUFFY,You okay?
WILLOW,I-
TARA,"I just, um - I realized, um, I'm-I'm late for study group."
WILLOW,"Tara, wait."
TARA,"No, no, it's okay. You-you should be with your friends, and, and I-I"
WILLOW,Wait...
RILEY,"So, um, I was missing something this afternoon, wasn't I?"
RILEY,"I mean, breakups are tough, but when Oz walked in, it seemed like"
BUFFY,Oz and Willow had a rough breakup.
DEMON,Grr.
RILEY,Hold that thought.
RILEY,"Man, that was record time."
BUFFY,(pouting) It's no fun when they're that easy.
RILEY,"(grinning) Speak for yourself. (Takes out radio) Base, this is Agent"
RADIO,"[unintelligible], Finn. We'll get there as soon as we can."
BUFFY,"So, I was just about to say something fascinating."
RILEY,Oz and Willow.
BUFFY,"Right. They had a rough breakup. Some stuff came up, and Oz pretty"
RILEY,I remember.
BUFFY,"The thing is before that, they were doing great. I mean, she was"
RILEY,"Whoa, wait."
RILEY,"Oz is a werewolf, and Willow was dating him?!"
BUFFY,Yes. Hence the high emotions.
RILEY,You're kidding me. Gotta say I'm surprised. I didn't think Willow
BUFFY,What kind of girl?
RILEY,Into dangerous guys. She seems smarter than that.
BUFFY,Oz is not dangerous. Something happened to him that wasn't his
RILEY,"(stopping her) Whoa, hey, how did we get to bigot? I'm just saying"
BUFFY,"Yeah, well love isn't logical, Riley. It's not like you can be"
BUFFY,God knows I haven't been.
RILEY,I'm not talking about you.
BUFFY,How about we don't talk about this at all? Okay? Let's just patrol.
OZ,Hey.
WILLOW,(nervous) Hey.
WILLOW,So... you wanna come inside?
OZ,"Actually, I want you to come outside. I wanna show you something."
WILLOW,Oz... (He stops walking too)  This is all so weird.
WILLOW,I-I-I feel like... this isn't really happening. Like it's a dream
OZ,It's real. Look up.
WILLOW,What?
OZ,(smiling) Look at the sky.
OZ,I guess you stopped keeping track of 'em after I left.
WILLOW,"Full moon. (Looks at Oz, back up at moon)"
OZ,Full moon.
WILLOW,"Full moon, but-but how? I mean (smiling) you did it! How, how did"
OZ,It's a long story.
WILLOW,"(looks up again, then down, smiling) Oh my god, Oz!"
WILLOW,"This is... I mean, it's wonderful for you."
OZ,"I talked to Xander, and he said you didn't have a new guy."
WILLOW,No. No new... guy.
OZ,"I know what I put you through, and I'm not gonna push. But I am... a"
OZ,That's what I want. That's why I'm here.
COMMANDO 1,Sir.
WILLOW,I love this.
OZ,A woman in Tibet traded it to me for the Radiohead record. Got a lot of
WILLOW,So Tibet was your favorite?
OZ,"Well, it's where I stayed the longest. This warlock in Romania sent me"
WILLOW,"Good, 'cause you were such a spaz before. (Smiles.) So that's it?"
OZ,"No, there's more. I take some herbs and stuff. Some chanting. A couple"
WILLOW,It's incredible. You've been all around the world. You've had this
OZ,Doesn't mean you haven't gone through a lot.
WILLOW,"It's true. Some of it, you know, was me telling myself I hated you"
OZ,"Well, thanks for that."
WILLOW,"And, I don't know, I - I think I'm getting better at my spells and"
WILLOW,It's so light out.
OZ,"Yeah, we talked all night."
WILLOW,"Well, I believe a manly sized breakfast is in order, don't you?"
OZ,Or we could just... (puts his hand on hers) sleep a little while.
OZ,Whatever you want.
WILLOW,I'll have the less confusing waffles right now.
OZ,Breakfast it is.
WILLOW,"Lemme just, ah, freshen up."
TARA,"Oh, sorry, I-I-I'll come back."
OZ,Are you looking for Willow? She's just in the bathroom down the hall.
TARA,"No, no. No, it's, it's okay. (Backing away)"
OZ,I saw you at Giles' yesterday.
TARA,Yeah. Sometimes Willow takes me with her to the s-scoobies.
OZ,You sure you don't wanna come in?
WILLOW,What?
OZ,Your friend came by. The blonde girl? But she wouldn't stay.
OZ,So what do you think? Where you wanna go?
RILEY,Morning.
BUFFY,Morning.
BUFFY,"Those like, regulation? Do you have to do those every morning?"
RILEY,"No, just a good way to start the day."
BUFFY,"Great, then you can have your perfectly balanced breakfast, and then"
RILEY,"Okay, I'm up less than a minute, and somehow I've managed to piss"
BUFFY,I should go home.
RILEY,"No, come on. Is it that whole thing about Willow last night? (He"
BUFFY,"You sounded like Mr. Initiative. Demons bad, people good."
RILEY,Something wrong with that theorem?
BUFFY,There's different degrees of-
RILEY,Evil?
BUFFY,It's just... different with different demons. There are creatures -
RILEY,Name one.
FORREST,"Rye, we need you downstairs. Beta team got hit."
RILEY,(stands up) Bad?
FORREST,We lost Willis.
RILEY,Graham?
FORREST,He's walking.
FORREST,We're going on a hunt.
BUFFY,(to Forrest) What kind of demon was it?
RILEY,(angry) Does it matter? (Walks past her holding his shirt. He and
BUFFY,Hey.
WILLOW,Hey. You okay?
BUFFY,"(rubbing her neck) Yeah, I just - I don't wanna talk about it. I"
WILLOW,I was with him all night.
BUFFY,All night? (Grins) Oh my god. (Sits on Willow's bed.) Wait. Last
WILLOW,Yup.
BUFFY,"Either you're about to tell me something incredibly kinky, or-"
WILLOW,"No kink. (Smiling) He didn't change, Buffy. He said he was gonna"
BUFFY,"(smiling) Oh my god. I can't believe it. (Pause) Okay, I'm all with"
WILLOW,"No, there's ""woo"" and, and ""hoo."" But there's ""uh-oh,"" and... ""why"
BUFFY,Why complicated?
WILLOW,"(sighs, steels herself) It's complicated... because of Tara."
BUFFY,(frowns) You mean Tara has a crush on Oz? No.
BUFFY,Oh!
BUFFY,"Oh. Um... well... that's great. You know, I mean, I think Tara's a,"
WILLOW,She is. And... there's something between us. It-it wasn't something
BUFFY,"Well, there you go, I mean, you know, you have to - you have to"
WILLOW,Why do you keep saying my name like that?
BUFFY,"(with false cheer) Like what, Will?"
WILLOW,(sits up) Are you freaked?
BUFFY,"What? No, Will, d- (stops herself, sighs) No. (Sits on bed) No,"
BUFFY,I'm glad you told me. What did you say to Oz?
WILLOW,"I was gonna tell him ... but then we started hanging out, and ... I"
WILLOW,"He's Oz, you know?"
BUFFY,Yeah. I know.
WILLOW,"I don't wanna hurt anyone, Buffy."
BUFFY,"No matter what, somebody's gonna get hurt.  And the important thing"
SPIKE,"(not opening his eyes) From the sound of those massive mud flaps,"
ADAM,"Spike, I want you to come with me."
SPIKE,"Do you? (Shrugs) Well, let's go then. (Turns as if to leave, then"
SPIKE,Ow.
ADAM,Come. (Steps forward; Spike steps back) You're going to help me with
SPIKE,Why is that exactly?
ADAM,I'm going to help you with yours.
WILLOW,Hi.
TARA,Hi.
WILLOW,I can only stay for a minute. I have class.
TARA,"Me too, I-I-I have class too."
WILLOW,"I just want you to know that what you saw this morning, it wasn't-"
TARA,"No, it's okay. I-I always knew that if he came back-"
WILLOW,We were just talking. Nothing happened.
TARA,(hopeful smile) Oh. (Pause) Really?
WILLOW,"But, you know, it was intense. Just talking. We have a lot to talk"
TARA,"(struggles for a moment) Whatever, you know, happens ... I'll still"
WILLOW,Of course we'll be friends! That's not even a question.
TARA,"(upset) But I'm saying, I know what Oz means to you."
WILLOW,"How can you, when I'm not even sure? I mean, I know what he meant"
TARA,What?
WILLOW,(teary) I don't know. I just - life was starting to get so good
TARA,Do what makes you ... h-h-happy.
OZ,"Hey. I thought I sm...ah, heard Willow."
TARA,"Hey. (notices Oz holding books) You're um, you're coming back to"
OZ,Pretty much. Feeling ... oddly motivated. (He still sniffs the air and
TARA,"That's um, that's great. I mean, that's, that's great for you and"
OZ,I hope so.
TARA,"(nervous) Good, that's, because-"
OZ,Is that her sweater?
TARA,"(looks down) I just, I just hope that you guys'll be very ... happy."
OZ,(moves closer) You smell like her. (Tara still doesn't look at him)
TARA,I can't. I-I can't talk about this. (Tries to walk away. Oz grabs her
OZ,But there's something to talk about? (Angrier)
OZ,Are you two involved?!
TARA,"I have, I, I, I have to go."
OZ,Cause she never said anything to me like that. We talked all night and
OZ,"(yelling) Is she in love with you? Tell me, is she?! (Shakes her by the"
OZ,Run.
FORREST,Are you okay?
TARA,What's going on?
FORREST,We'll take it from here.
COMMANDO 2,This thing looks like it may be one of the demons that took out
RILEY,"We'll take it back. We'll make an ID. If it is, we'll put him down."
TARA,"You don't understand, that's - (stuttering)"
FORREST,"Listen, we know what we're doing. You're in shock."
TARA,But-
FORREST,We'll handle it. (Walks away.)
TARA,No.
SPIKE,"Well, that sounds like a lot of fun."
ADAM,"You see my problem, though. Total annihilation of the humans doesn't"
SPIKE,I get that. I'm still not sure how the Slayer fits in.
ADAM,The humans need a leader... a champion. The Slayer can do that.
SPIKE,(skeptical) Yeah... the thing about the Slayer is... she is a whiny
ADAM,Then I guess you should be on her side.
SPIKE,"This all goes down, the chip comes out, yeah? No tricks."
ADAM,Scout's honor.
SPIKE,*You* were a Boy Scout?
ADAM,Parts of me.
WILLOW,What's up? You okay?
TARA,"Oz. We were talking and, he changed. Right in front of me."
WILLOW,What? It's daylight.
TARA,"I know, but it happened."
WILLOW,"Oh my god, are you all right?"
TARA,"I'm fine. Riley and the commando guys, they stopped him. But they"
WILLOW,When? Just now?
TARA,I think they might hurt him.
WILLOW,"I, I have to go, I have to find Buffy."
TARA,I know.
WILLOW,Tara said they took him right before she found me.
ANYA,"So that's good, right? I mean, they probably haven't had time to"
XANDER,"An, you can help by making this a quiet time."
GILES,Once again we're faced with a fairly daunting prospect of having to
XANDER,It'd be great if we knew someone dating a man on the inside.
XANDER,"Oh, wait! (Gestures at Buffy)"
BUFFY,He's still not answering his pages. I left him another message.
WILLOW,So what do we do?
BUFFY,"Well, we need to move fast. So we make a plan without Riley... (Shot"
FORREST,"What's the word, Doc? Is this the animal that took apart our men?"
DOC 1,"We don't know yet, soldier."
RILEY,What's the holdup? I thought Graham gave you a full description.
DOC 1,The holdup is that he described characteristics present in over 40
RILEY,(impatient) And how long is that gonna take?
DOC 1,(annoyed) I have no idea.
RILEY,I don't need a bunch of tests to know that this thing's a killer.
RILEY,"Hey, he's coming to. Oz!"
DOC 1,He won't be able to talk for a while. We gave him Haldol to keep him
RILEY,Why? He's not a threat now.
DOC 1,"I allowed you to stay as long as you let us do our work, Agent Finn."
DOC 2,I always suspected that stuff about werewolf transformations being
RILEY,"Oh, hey, that's enough. Come on, the guy's a student, I know him."
DOC 1,(points to the other soldiers) Take him out.
COMMANDO 3,Yes sir.
DOC 2,See that? Transformation related to negative stimulation.
BUFFY,Something's wrong. Riley usually returns my phone calls by now.
XANDER,We can't wait much longer.
BUFFY,"I know. (Looks at Willow) Okay. Xander, you and I are gonna go in."
WILLOW,I'm going with you.
BUFFY,"No. Look, it's too dangerous, Will. Besides, I need you to help"
WILLOW,"Giles can do it without me. I can give him all the instructions, I"
GILES,Of course.
WILLOW,I-I can't just sit here.
BUFFY,"Okay. Okay, you can back us up. (Sighs) Now, the only way I know"
XANDER,"So we grab a guy, make him take us."
SPIKE,Or you could just use the back way.
SPIKE,Hell of a lot less bother.
GILES,How did you get in?
SPIKE,"Door was unlocked. You might wanna watch that, Rupert. Someone"
BUFFY,Or someone formerly dangerous and currently annoying.
SPIKE,"(extremely amused and pleased with himself) Now, now. None of that."
GILES,"Short of cash, Spike?"
SPIKE,"I happen to be seeking monetary gratification, yeah. But I also get"
BUFFY,"Uh-huh. So what's the going rate on a wild goose chase, Spike?"
SPIKE,"Fine, if you're not interested. But I was stuck in that hole,"
RILEY,"Oz. Put these on, man. (Gives Oz some clothes.)"
FORREST,End of the line.
COLONEL,At ease.
RILEY,"Permission to speak, Colonel."
COLONEL,Denied.
COLONEL,"Being new around here, Finn, I had a look at your record and"
RILEY,"Sir, the prisoner-"
COLONEL,You will speak when I tell you to!
COLONEL,Tomorrow I am going to institute a court-martial to investigate
COLONEL,No woman is worth that.
BUFFY,"I've mentioned how much I'm gonna kill you if this is a scam, right?"
SPIKE,"Look, would I wear this if I wasn't on the up-and-up?"
WILLOW,You do sorta look like an evil olive.
XANDER,Guys... check it out.
SPIKE,"For a nasty town like Sunnydale, nobody seems to mind their locks."
BUFFY,You first.
GILES,Try typing in.... (looks at paper maps of the area) X-H-4-J-7 for
ANYA,Slap my hand now! (Chuckles and holds up hand)
GILES,Beg your pardon?
ANYA,In celebration.
GILES,Oh... (slaps her hand) Yes.
ANYA,Ow!
BUFFY,Hey! (Points her crossbow in his face. He pulls his arm back)
BUFFY,You know who I am?
COLONEL,"(looks from her to Xander, to Spike and Willow in the doorway) Yeah."
BUFFY,Then you know I'm pretty good with this thing. Take us to him.
Colonel,Finn stays in the brig. Helping an HST escape is a court-martial
BUFFY,Riley tried to help Oz escape?
COLONEL,(looks from one to the other) That's who you came for. The wolf.
XANDER,Guess we're two for one.
BUFFY,Get dressed.
GUARD,"Hey, you dropped-"
RILEY,How'd you get in? (Buffy opens his cell door)
BUFFY,Talk later. Stealthy escape now.
RILEY,"Buffy... (She turns back to him) I leave now, I can't ever come back."
RILEY,I just wanted to hear that out loud.
VOICE,Hold it!
BUFFY,Stay back... or I'll pull a William Burroughs on your leader here.
XANDER,You'll bore him to death with free prose?
BUFFY,"Was I the only one awake in English that day? (Slowly, like you'd"
WILLOW,Oz....
OZ,"Will, get back."
BUFFY,Let's go.
COLONEL,"You're a dead man, Finn."
RILEY,"No, sir. I'm an anarchist."
BUFFY,"I hope everybody else is okay. It was better to split up, right? I"
RILEY,"It was better. Besides, I think it's mostly me the Initiative wants now."
BUFFY,Probably. So what should we do?
RILEY,(puts his head in his hands) We'll be safe for tonight at least. The
BUFFY,"Quite a day, huh?"
BUFFY,You woke up to a big bowl of Wheaties. Now you're a fugitive. (Comes
RILEY,I don't know. I'm sorry it ended that way. But I am glad it's done.
RILEY,I was wrong about Oz. I *was* being a bigot.
BUFFY,No you weren't. You were thrown. You found out that Willow was in...
RILEY,"Still... I was in a totally black and white space, people versus"
BUFFY,I have to tell you some stuff... about my past. And it's not all
RILEY,You can tell me anything.
BUFFY,I think so. (Smiles) I think I can.
WILLOW,"This thing looks pretty good, considering you drove it overseas."
OZ,"Well, it broke down outside of Mexico, and I traded my bass to have it"
OZ,I shouldn't have come back now.... I just thought I'd changed.
WILLOW,You have changed. (Smiles) You stopped the wolf from coming out. I
OZ,"But I couldn't look at you. (He still can't.) I mean, it turns out..."
WILLOW,It was my fault. I upset you.
OZ,"Well, so we're safe then, (sarcastic) cause you'll never do that again."
OZ,But... you're happy?
WILLOW,(smiles) I am. I can't explain it-
OZ,It may be safer for both os us if you don't.
WILLOW,"I missed you, Oz. I wrote you so many letters... but I didn't have"
WILLOW,I couldn't live like that.
OZ,It was stupid to think that you'd just be... waiting.
WILLOW,I was waiting. I feel like some part of me will always be waiting
OZ,"I know. (Pause) But now is not that time, I guess."
WILLOW,(shakes her head) No.
WILLOW,What are you gonna do?
OZ,I think I better take off.
WILLOW,When?
OZ,Pretty much now.
WILLOW,"No candles? Well, I brought one. It's extra flamey."
WILLOW,"Tara, I have to tell you..."
TARA,"No, I-I understand. You have to be with the person you l-love."
WILLOW,(smiles) I am.
TARA,You mean...
WILLOW,I mean. (pause) Okay?
TARA,"Oh, yes."
WILLOW,I feel horrible about everything I put you through. A-and I'm gonna
TARA,(starts to smile) Right now?
