BUFFY,Ha! Touchdown! Oh yeah. Go team me. (She does a victory dance)
RILEY,Anybody ever tell team you the quarterback throws like a girl? (Throws the ball back)
BUFFY,"(catches the ball, frowning) I do?"
BUFFY,"(concerned) Ooh, sorry!"
BUFFY,"No, don't, no - (shrieks as Riley tackles her)"
XANDER,I'm exhausted just looking at those two. All the splashing and jumping and running... Shouldn't relaxing involve less exertion?
ANYA,Absolutely. Exertion can lead to sweatiness.
TARA,Which can cause the pain and heartbreak of stinkiness. Better to just stay put.
WILLOW,I think we've just put our finger on why we're the sidekicks.
WILLOW,Game over?
RILEY,"Uh, Buffy slayed the football. (Holds up the deflated ball, then tosses it aside)"
BUFFY,Where's my burger? (Xander is still trying to light the fire)
RILEY,"Yeah, man, I'm starving. Cow me. (He and Buffy sit)"
XANDER,"The, uh, fire's not cooperating. It's comforting to know that I lack the culinary finesse of a caveman."
WILLOW,(gestures at fire) <I>Ignis incende.</I>
BUFFY,"Willow, check you out! Witch-fu."
WILLOW,"It's no big. You just have to balance the elements so when you affect one, you don't wind up causing..."
WILLOW,I didn't do it! I didn't do it!
They all grab their stuff and run off. Cut to,
GUY1,"Come on, hurry it up, I'm getting soaked."
GUY2,"I'm trying. Geez, this thing weighs-"
GUY1,(annoyed) Nice. Good job.
GUY2,(kneels to check out the broken corner) Look at this. Guy's carting dirt around.
GUY1,"Leave it. We'll, we'll turn it on its side."
GUY2,"Dirt. Man, rich people are-"
A hand bursts out of the box and slashes his throat. He screams and staggers backward. The other guy watches in horror as a body begins to burst out of the box. Cut to,
WILLOW,There you go. All set.
GILES,"Thank you, Willow. Obstinate bloody machine simply refused to work for me. (Walks off)"
WILLOW,"Just call me the computer whisperer. (Stands up, putting something in the scanner) Let's get scannin'. I want to see this puppy go."
GILES,Start with those.
WILLOW,(scowls) Start? Where is finish?
GILES,"Willow, it's essential that we begin archiving the library. I mean, most of these texts have no duplicates."
WILLOW,But ... now? Doesn't winter seem more like archiving season?
GILES,"(looks surprised) Well, you don't have to, Willow, I mean, you're, you're welcome to leave if, uh..."
WILLOW,"No. It's fine. (Sits back down) It's just, you've been Mr. Project all summer. You know? Labeling the amulets and indexing your diaries. (Giles gives a little smile) I draw the line at making giant rubber band balls. That's when you'll just have to get a life. (Opens the scanner and takes out whatever is in it)"
GILES,"(clears throat) That's what I'm trying to do, actually, is, um, get a life. (Sits down)"
WILLOW,"(not looking at him, doesn't realize he's turned serious) It might go better if you left the house."
GILES,"Willow, um... you mustn't repeat what I'm about to say. Especially not to Buffy. (Willow looks confused and concerned)"
WILLOW,Uh-oh.
GILES,You promise?
WILLOW,"Oh, god. Well, I guess. Now that I know there's something to know, I can't *not* know, just because I'm afraid somebody'll know I know, you know?"
GILES,Did that mean yes?
WILLOW,Yeah.
GILES,"We're doing all this because I, I want you and the others to have everything you need at your fingertips. You see, I'm, I'm going back to England."
WILLOW,You're ... what? But you can't! You're ... Buffy's Watcher!
WILLOW,"I mean, in a fired way, but..."
GILES,"Well, it's become quite obvious that Buffy doesn't need me. I-I don't say that in a self-pitying way, I'm, I'm quite proud, actually. (Smiles gently)"
WILLOW,"But what about the rest of us? We still need to be watched! Personally, I can't get through a day without a little hairy eyeball."
GILES,"(laughs softly) I appreciate the sentiment, but it's, it's just not so. You'll be fine. You all will. (Gets up) And you know, we'll, we'll stay in touch. You can always call me whenever you like."
WILLOW,When are you gonna tell Buffy?
GILES,"Soon. It won't be easy, but, um... I know she'll understand."
BUFFY,"Thanks, Mom. Everything was yummy. (Put her napkin on the table)"
JOYCE,"Hey, you up for dessert? We could, uh, take a drive, get some ice cream."
BUFFY,"(stands) You know, I, I would, but I kinda have to get out on patrol. (Begins gathering up dishes)"
JOYCE: Now? It's 8,30.
BUFFY,"Well, vamps don't really care what time it is. You know, dark equals dinner bell. (Begins carrying dishes to kitchen. Joyce stays seated)"
JOYCE,"Right, of course. (Look around empty table) You know, I'm gonna have to get used to this place without you again. It gets so quiet."
BUFFY,"You know, maybe we should make a regular date of this, when school starts."
JOYCE,(nods) Mm.
BUFFY,I'm sorry. (Kisses Joyce on cheek) Duty calls. It's a total drag. (Leaves)
MAN,Very impressive hunt.
MAN,Such power.
BUFFY,That was no hunt. That was just another day on the job.
BUFFY,Care to step up for some overtime?
MAN,We're not going to fight.
BUFFY,Do you *know* what a slayer is?
MAN,Do you? (Smirking)
BUFFY,Who are you?
MAN,I apologize. I assumed you knew. I am Dracula.
BUFFY,Get out!
WILLOW,"Xand ... what if somebody had a secret, and that somebody promised somebody else that they wouldn't tell anyone."
XANDER,"(nodding) News flash, Will. Everybody knows."
WILLOW,"No, thi-this isn't about me and Tara."
XANDER,"Oh. Well, not that I wouldn't be all ears if you wanted to tell me a secret about you two. Even if it was very, very naughty."
WILLOW,"(grins) Sorry, this is of the non-naughty variety. And I'm not telling you. (Nods firmly)"
XANDER,Okay. Want to see if Buffy's hanging around the headstones?
WILLOW,"Sure. So if I was gonna tell you, which I'm not going to...."
BUFFY,"So lemme get this straight. You're ... (in Dracula's accent) ""Dracula."" The guy, the count."
DRACULA,I am. (We can see his fangs now.)
BUFFY,And you're sure this isn't just some fanboy thing? Cause ... I've fought more than a couple of pimply overweight vamps that called themselves Lestat.
DRACULA,"(looks a little annoyed) You know who I am. As I would now without question that you are Buffy Summers. (Walks toward her, looming over her.)"
BUFFY,You're heard of me?
DRACULA,Naturally. You're known throughout the world.
BUFFY,(smiles bashfully) Naw. Really?
DRACULA,Why else would I come here? For the sun? I came to meet the renowned ... killer.
BUFFY,"Yeah, I prefer the term slayer. You know, killer just sounds so..."
DRACULA,Naked?
BUFFY,"Like I ... paint clowns or something. I'm the good guy, remember?"
DRACULA,"Perhaps, but your power is rooted in darkness. You must feel it."
BUFFY,No. You know what I feel? Bored.
BUFFY,"Okay, that's cheating."
XANDER,"Hey Buff, what's up?"
WILLOW,You look like you just-
BUFFY,Get out of here. Now.
XANDER,"Fine, but I was gonna give you a sip of my double-mint mocha, but.. (We see Dracula reappearing behind him)"
BUFFY,Behind you.
WILLOW,Hi.
XANDER,"Nice. Look who's got a bad case of dark prince envy. (Behind him we see Buffy holding her stake, looking concerned)"
DRACULA,I have no interest in you. Leave us.
XANDER,"No, we're not going to (in Dracula's accent) ""leave you."" And where'd you get that accent, Sesame Street? (As the Count on Sesame Street) Vun, two, three -- three victims. Mwa ha ha!"
BUFFY,"(whispering) Xander, I'm pretty sure that's Dracula."
XANDER,"Wow, really? (Hurries to stand behind Buffy) Hey, sorry, man, I was ... just jokin' around."
DRACULA,This is not the time. (Locks eyes with Buffy) I will see you soon.
BUFFY,"Bat! Ooh, bat!"
The bat squeaks and flies away again. Cut to,
XANDER VO,"And then Buffy's all, ""Look out!"""
XANDER,And then frigging Dracula's standing right behind us. (Sits on sofa where Anya and Willow are already sitting. We see Buffy and Riley standing around.)
WILLOW,"And then, he lunges at us, like whoosh! (With hand gestures)"
XANDER,He totally looked shorter in person.
BUFFY,"I told you he'd heard of me, right? I mean, can you believe that? (Shot of Giles nodding patiently) Count Famous heard of me."
RILEY,"I couldn't believe it the first twenty times you told us, but it's starting to sink in now."
BUFFY,I'm sorry. Am I repeat-o-girl? I was just ... blown away.
RILEY,"It's not that surprising that he's heard of you, Buffy. You are the slayer."
BUFFY,"I guess. Just - the way he said it, you know, I mean, he made it sound so..."
WILLOW,Sexy? I bet he made it sound sexy. (Grinning. We see Tara coming up behind her.)
BUFFY,Kinda. He of the dark penetrating eyes and lilty accent. (Sits)
<u>XANDER VO,I wonder if he knows Frankenstein.</u>
TARA,(sits on arm of couch and gives Willow a glass of soda) You thought Dracula was sexy?
WILLOW,"Oh! No. He, he was ... yuck."
ANYA,"Right, except for the whole tall, dark, and handsome thing? Yucko."
XANDER,How would you know?
ANYA,"Well, we hung out a few times. (Xander looks jealous) Back in my demon days, you know, once or twice. He's pretty cool. (sighs wistfully, then remembers herself) You know, from, from a whole ... evil thing perspective."
XANDER,(scoffs) Please. He was no big whoop.
WILLOW,No big whoop?? What about that thing where he turned himself into a bat? That was awesome!
GILES,"It must have been, yes. (Everyone looks at him) I must admit, I'm sorry I missed that."
WILLOW,"(suddenly realizing) Me too! The whole time I was thinking, 'Gosh, I wish Giles were here, he'd know what to do!'"
WILLOW,(to the others) Didn't you guys ... think that?
BUFFY,"Actually, I was more thinking, 'Bat!' (Wiggles hands near her head)"
XANDER,(to Giles) How come he can do that?
GILES,"I, I have no idea. There's a great deal of myth about Dracula. I imagine the trick to defeating him lies in separating the fact from the fiction."
WILLOW,"Great point! That is so Giles, to think of something like that, you know? (To the others) That, that we ... would have never... (trails off)"
BUFFY,"So we should take things slow with Dracula. I mean, he said that we would meet again, but I would like to avoid that until we do some serious homework."
RILEY,"I don't know. I mean, he may have a bunch of swell party tricks, but he's still just a vampire. I say we load up with stakes and crossbows and go after him now."
XANDER,Second.
ANYA,"No, Buffy's right. Dracula's too slick to fall for the usual stuff."
BUFFY,So we hold off. No killing until we know exactly what we're dealing with.
RILEY,"You're not just saying that because of those dark penetrating eyes of his, are you?"
BUFFY,"Noooo, his eyes were -- (Gets up and goes over to Riley) There were - there was no penetration. (Embarrassed) Cross my heart."
GILES,"All right. Willow, you and Tara find out everything you can about the actual legend of Vlad the Impaler on the Internet, (Willow and Tara nod) and, uh, I'll check the library. (Everyone starts to get up)"
RILEY,"If the Initiative was still around, we'd be able to find everything on this guy in a few hours."
BUFFY,"We might not be as fast, but we'll find him. You guys, we'll reconvene here in the morning."
RILEY,What's your plan?
BUFFY,Big sleep. My count encounter wiped me out.
RILEY,(nods) I'm kinda wired. Maybe I should just let you get your rest.
BUFFY,"You sure? I mean, maybe if you just lie down with me... (suggestive look)"
RILEY,(grinning) Nothing you are about to say will lead to rest.
BUFFY,I guess you're right. I'll see you in the morning?
RILEY,Mm-hmm. With donuts.
BUFFY,Mm. Heaven. (Smooch) See? A little sugar and I'm all yours. Dracula schmacula.
ANYA,"I doubt he'd remember me. I was just a silly young thing. I mean, like seven hundred or so. But he did say that this guy I cursed was doomed forever, which was really sweet, don't you think?"
XANDER,Adorable.
ANYA,"It was a great spell. I made this jerk incredibly fat, like a human minivan."
ANYA VO,You should just mention my name if you see him again.
XANDER,"Or better yet, why don't you just go sit on top of a crypt and flaunt your neck cleavage until Dracula shows up? Then you two can talk private."
ANYA,"Oh please, don't tell me you're jealous."
XANDER,"Oh no, just because you're panting over the guy. (Stops walking)"
ANYA,I am not panting. Now stop being silly. I'll see you tomorrow. (Smooch)
XANDER,You don't wanna come back to my place?
ANYA,"It's whites day, remember? The bleach smell makes me nauseous. (Walks off)"
XANDER,"Fine. I suppose Dracula doesn't use bleach, huh? He's a darks-only man. (Walks off. We see the wolf still watching him.)"
XANDER,"(sighing) Great. Perfect. (suddenly deciding he's not scared) You know what? You're not so big. (Looks Dracula up and down) One round of old-fashioned fisticuffs, you'd fold like a bitty baby."
XANDER,"(rolls up sleeves) Okay, let's do it. And no poofing. Come on, puffy shirt. Pucker on up, cause you can kiss your pale ass-"
DRACULA,Silence.
XANDER,"Yes master. (Shakes head) No, that's not-"
DRACULA,"(lifts a hand) You will be my emissary, my eyes and ears in daylight."
XANDER,Your emissary?
DRACULA,Serve me well. You will be rewarded. I will make you an immortal. A child of darkness that feeds on life itself... on blood.
XANDER,"(in Dracula's accent) ""Blood""? (speaking very quickly) Yes! Yes! I will serve you, your excellent spookiness."
XANDER,(still speaking too quickly) Or master. I'll just stick with master.
DRACULA,<u>You are strange and off-putting.</u> Go now.
XANDER,"But master, how can I find- (Sees Dracula is gone) Brilliant. What an exit! Guy's a genius! (Giggles crazily and walks off)"
SPIKE,"Well, well."
SPIKE,"You can take the boy out of the Initiative, but you can't take the Initiative out of the boy."
RILEY,"I'd put that down, unless you're bucking for one hell of a headache."
SPIKE,I can't be too careful. I got quite a few demons after me these days.
RILEY,I'm looking for some information. <u>Might pay a little.</u>
SPIKE,(shrugs) I'll play. (Goes over to a couple of chairs)
RILEY,What can you tell me about Dracula?
SPIKE,"Dracula? (scoffs) Poncy bugger owes me eleven pounds, for one thing. (Puts a cigarette in his mouth)"
RILEY,You know him?
SPIKE,"Know him? We're old rivals. (Lights cigarette) But then he got famous, forgot all about his foes. (Points at Riley) I'll tell you what. That glory hound's done more harm to vampires than any slayer. His story gets out, and suddenly everybody knows how to kill us. (Sits down) You know, the mirror bit?"
RILEY,"But he's not just a regular vampire. I mean, he has special powers, right?"
SPIKE,"Nothing but showy gypsy stuff. What's it to you, anyway?"
RILEY,He's in town. Making his presence known.
SPIKE,(smiling) Drac's in Sunnydale-way? (Puts feet up on a cassock)  I guess the old boy needed closure after all.
RILEY,"Actually, he's gunning for Buffy. But I'm out to find him before he gets another shot at her. (Sits)"
SPIKE,"Tough talk, cowboy. But you're not gonna catch him napping in a crypt. No, the count has to have his luxury estate and his bug-eaters and his special dirt, don't he?"
RILEY,"So you're saying I should check out mansions, that sort of thing?"
SPIKE,"No. (stands) I'm saying ... you should go home to your superhoney. Have a nice, safe snog. You're out of your depth on this one, boy. (Turns his back on Riley)"
RILEY,"You've helped Buffy before, so she has a problem with killing you now that you're helpless. (Spike still turned away)"
RILEY,I don't.
SPIKE,I'd like to see you try.
RILEY,Would you?
SPIKE,Pfft.
SPIKE,(calls out as Riley is at the door) You're never gonna find him.
SPIKE,(to himself) Not before he gets to her.
Cut to,"Exterior shot of Joyce's house, night."
DRACULA,You are magnificent.
BUFFY,I bet you say that before you bite all the girls.
DRACULA,"No, you are different. Kindred."
BUFFY,"Kindred? Hardly, I-"
DRACULA,Pull your hair back.
<u>BUFFY VO,This isn't how I ... usually fight.</u>
BUFFY,You think you can just waft in here with your music video wind and your hypno-eyes... (trails off)
DRACULA,I have searched the world over for you. I have yearned for you. (Sits on the bed next to her) <u>For a creature whose darkness rivals my own.</u>
DRACULA,<u>You have been tasted.</u> (smiles slightly as he trails his fingers over her cheek)
BUFFY,He was-
DRACULA,"Unworthy. (Buffy stares at him, looks scared) He let you go. (Looks her in the eyes) But the embrace ... his bite ... you remember."
BUFFY,(uncertain) No.
DRACULA,Do not fight. (Puts his hand behind her neck) I can feel your hunger.
RILEY,"Here's a jelly one, you want it?"
BUFFY,No.
"XANDER: Got it! Got it. Mine, mine. (Note",throughout this scene Xander speaks each line very quickly and moves around a lot.)
WILLOW,"Well, I think we have Dracula factoids."
XANDER,(sitting on a stool eating the donut) Like any of that's enough to fight the dark master.
XANDER,...bator.
"WILLOW: A lot of it we already knew. (Riley walks to another chair opposite the couch) Turnoffs: wood, fire, crosses, garlic. Turnons","nice duds, minions, (wistful) long slow bites that last for days..."
RILEY,"Yeah, I did a little research too. (Shot of Buffy looking distracted) Dracula likes to live in style. Which means we can rule out the usual dumps vampires haunt."
XANDER,Ah! But he's smart enough to figure that we probably already know that. I'm guessing he's lying low. (Licks his donut. Giles comes out from the kitchen)
WILLOW,"Actually, my research backs Riley up. Drac isn't the lay-low type."
GILES,"(gives Riley a glass of milk) So we can, uh, check out the nicer places. Don't you think, Buffy?"
GILES,Buffy?
BUFFY,Yeah. We'll check all the swanky places first. What else did you guys get?
GILES,"Well, Willow has most of it, actually."
WILLOW,(sits up) Only because you gave me super pointers! I never would have...
GILES,"(puts up hand to stop her) Just go ahead, Willow."
WILLOW,"OK. Dracula's modus operandi is different from other vampires. He will kill just to feed, but he'd rather have a connection with his victims. And he has all of these mental powers to draw them in."
WILLOW,"He, he can read and control minds... appear in dreams..."
BUFFY,(distracted) Uh huh.
WILLOW,"Makes sense. That stare ... he just kinda ... looked right through you. Didn't you feel it, Buffy?"
BUFFY,"(pause) No. (gets up) No, I didn't."
XANDER,See! Buffy didn't feel it. I think you're drawing a low of crazy conclusions about the unholy prince.
XANDER,...bator.
GILES,"The point is, though he goes through the motions of an intimate seduction, the end result is the same. He turns them into a vampire."
XANDER,"Well. That *is* intimate. Dracula's gifting these ladies with his own blood. And blood -- (He notices a spider on the desk next to him, glances around to see if anyone's looking) Blood is life."
XANDER,According to them. (Slams his hand down on the spider)
GILES,"Um ... Just be aware that he, he tends to form a relationship with his prey. (When no one's looking, Xander scoops the spider into his mouth and chews) It's not enough for him to take her. She must want to be taken. She must ... burn for him. (Buffy looks uncomfortable, fiddling with her scarf.)"
BUFFY,That's ... interesting. I'm gonna go find him.
RILEY,"You shouldn't go by yourself, Buffy. I mean, this guy's seriously dangerous."
BUFFY,"It's cool, I got it. (Opens door, leaves.)"
RILEY,Hey. (grabs her arm and stops her) Take off that scarf.
BUFFY,What? No. (puts hand over scarf)
RILEY,"(gives an ""I knew it"" nod) You're under the thrall of the dark prince!"
BUFFY,(scoffs) I am not under the thrall of the dark prince.
RILEY,Then take off the scarf.
BUFFY,"Oh, let go of me! This is ridiculous. (tries to break arm out of Riley's grasp but he holds on)"
GILES,Why didn't you say anything?
XANDER,"Cause she didn't want to worry us, right Buffster? It's nothin'. Just a scratch."
WILLOW,"Two deep, puncture-y scratches."
BUFFY,"I'm not sure why I tried to hide it. Uh, there was just this voice, and it was, it was telling me to cover it."
RILEY,And what did I tell you? (to the others) That's thrall.
XANDER,"You're saying Dracula has some sort of freaky mind control over her? You're watching too many creature features, man."
BUFFY,"But it does seem like he has this ... control over me, I ... even though a big part of me is resisting."
RILEY,"No, that's okay. I shouldn't take this personally. I mean, what with Angel, I mean, it's understandable that there would be transference. I mean, they're both broody immortals."
BUFFY,"(firmly) I am not transfer-y. (quieter) I swear to you. I'm your girl, and I'm gonna stay that way."
RILEY,Okay. But you are not going anywhere near him again.
GILES,"Uh, Riley's right, you should - you should stay out of sight. Let the rest of us look for Dracula."
BUFFY,I can't go home. He already got inside once.
XANDER,You can come over to my place. I'll make sure you stay put.
GILES,"Good. Um, Riley and I can, uh, can... search for Dracula, and Willow, you and Tara could uh, could do a protection spell on Buffy's mother's house, and prevent him from returning."
WILLOW,(nodding) Got it. How'd he get inside anyway?
JOYCE,He seemed so nice and normal. A little pale.
WILLOW,A good Sunnydale rule of thumb? Avoid white-skinned men in capes.
JOYCE,"I'm not like this. I don't invite strange men over for coffee, it's just ... Oh, when you girls are older you'll understand. (Sits on stairs)  It's hard to date. Sometimes you just ... feel like giving up on men altogether."
Willow and Tara sneak little looks at each other and try not to grin. Cut to,
RILEY,Another bust. (crosses something off on notepad)
GILES,And it's getting dark. I should have turned up a better lead. There must be an easier way to find him.
RILEY,"Too late to worry about that now. If we hurry, we can hit these last places."
ANYA,How come I have to be here slayer-sitting while the other guys get to look for Dracula?
ANYA,"I mean, just because I'm-"
XANDER,What time is it?
ANYA,"(checks watch) Uh, almost six. (stands up so she's standing in front of the open closet door) Look, I mean, I'm the one who knows him, I-I'm the one who had a really good look at him, and so, I mean, what-"
ANYA,Hey! What?
XANDER,(still talking too fast) I'm supposed to deliver you to the master now.
XANDER,There's this whole deal where I get to be immortal. You cool with that?
BUFFY,Take me to him.
She stands. We still hear Anya pounding and yelling. Cut to,
XANDER,"Master? I deliver the slayer. She who you most desire. (Buffy walks in behind him, still looking kind of catatonic. Xander gives a little bow.)"
XANDER,"Sorry, whom."
XANDER,"So now comes the immortality, right? You do the thing, and-"
DRACULA,Leave us.
DRACULA,We must not be interrupted.
XANDER,You bet. (leaves)
DRACULA,I knew you'd come.
BUFFY,"Why? Because I'm under your thrall? (Whips out Mister Pointy and drops the dazed expression) Well, guess again, pal."
DRACULA,Put the stake down.
BUFFY,"Okay. (Puts it down, then looks at her hand in surprise) Right. That ... was not ... you. (Sounding unconvinced) I did that. I did that because ... I wanted to."
BUFFY,Maybe I should rethink that thrall thing. (looks around nervously and gives a little whimper)
RILEY,I've lived in Sunnydale a couple of years now. Know what I've never noticed before?
GILES,"Uh, a castle?"
RILEY,A big honking castle.
BUFFY,Stay away from me.
DRACULA,"Are you afraid I will bite you? (walking slowly toward her) Slayer, that's why you came."
BUFFY,No. Last night ... it's not gonna happen again.
DRACULA,(still walking toward her) Stop me. Stake me.
BUFFY,(backing up a little) I... (glancing at stake on the table) Any minute now.
DRACULA,Do you know why you cannot resist?
BUFFY,Cause you're famous?
DRACULA,Because you do not want to.
BUFFY,(shakes head nervously) My friends-
DRACULA,They're here. (she looks at him) They will not find us. We are alone.
DRACULA,Always alone.
DRACULA,"(begins to circle around her) There is so much I have to teach you. Your history, your power ... what your body is capable of..."
BUFFY,(shaking head) I don't need to know.
DRACULA,You long to. And you will have eternity to discover yourself. (Comes back around in front to face her) But first ... a little taste.
BUFFY,I won't let you.
DRACULA,I didn't mean for me.
XANDER,Nobody harms my master.
RILEY,Your master?
XANDER,You want him? You come through me.
RILEY,Okey-dokey.
GILES,"Oh, good show, Giles. Uhh... at least you didn't get knocked out for a change. (Turns over on his back with a groan)"
GILES,"Oh ... oh, ladies."
GILES,"You would ... be the three sisters, yes?"
GILES,"E-excellent, right. Uh, I'd heard that you were myth ... obviously erroneous."
GILES,"Aah! Ooh, that's, uh, that, uh... (giggling) tickles! Ooh, uh... oh, dear god. (Panting)"
BUFFY,What are you-
DRACULA,All those years fighting us. Your power so near to our own... (Cuts his arm with a fingernail till blood wells up) ...and you've never once wanted to know what it is that we fight for? (Holds his arm out to Buffy) Never even a taste?
BUFFY,(looks conflicted) If I drink that-
DRACULA,I have not drunk enough for you to change. You must be near death to become one of us. And that comes only when you plead for it.
BUFFY,(staring at his wrist) I'm not hungry.
DRACULA,No. Your craving goes deeper than that.
DRACULA,(whispering) You think you know ... what you are ... what's to come. You haven't even begun.
DRACULA,Find it. The darkness. Find your true nature.
BUFFY,(softly) Wow.
BUFFY,(normal voice) That was gross.
DRACULA,You are resisting.
BUFFY,Looks like.
DRACULA,Come here. Come to me. (holds out hand)
BUFFY,"You know, I really think the thrall has gone out of our relationship. But I want to thank you for opening up my eyes a little."
DRACULA,What is this?
BUFFY,My true nature. You want a taste?
RILEY,Buffy? Are you in- (stops himself before falling into the pit) Giles! Giles!
RILEY,"Come on, come on. Grab my hand."
GILES,Thank god you came.
RILEY,Come on!
GILES,There was no possible escape.
GILES,"Oh, my shoe. (Pointing back into the pit) Silly me, I'll just pop-"
RILEY,"No no no, sir! (Pulls him away) No more chick pit for you. Come on. (They get up and move off down the hall.)"
BUFFY,A guy like you should think about going electric. Seriously.
BUFFY,How do you like my darkness now?
RILEY,Buffy! You okay?
BUFFY,Yeah. Chock full of free will.
GILES,And Dracula?
BUFFY,Eurotrashed.
XANDER,(back to talking normally) Where is he?? Where's the creep that turned me into his spider-eating man-bitch?
BUFFY,He's gone.
XANDER,"Dammit! You know what? I'm sick of this crap. I'm sick of being the guy who eats insects and gets the funny syphilis. As of this moment, it's over. I'm finished being everybody's butt-monkey!"
BUFFY,Check. No more butt-monkey.
RILEY,It coulda been worse. At least you weren't making time with the dracu-babes like Giles here.
GILES,"I was not making time! I, I was, uh, just about to kill those, uh, loathsome creatures when Riley interrupted me. (Wrapping his torn shirt around himself)"
GILES,Of course not! I was in complete... (the others have walked off) control.
BUFFY,You think I don't watch your movies? (rolling her eyes) You always come back.
BUFFY VO,I'm standing right here!
BUFFY VO,You wanted to see me?
GILES,Yes. Thanks for coming. Can I offer you some tea?
BUFFY,"Oh ... no, thanks. (notices a plate on the table by the sofa) Ooh, cookies. How come I rate the little cookie treatment?"
GILES,"Well, actually, I have something to tell you. (comes over with a teapot. They both sit on the sofa.)"
BUFFY,"Actually, I have something that I'd like to talk to you about, too."
GILES,"Oh, well, you go first, by all means."
BUFFY,"No, go ahead."
GILES,"No, I insist. (pouring tea)"
BUFFY,"(after a moment, softly) You haven't been my Watcher for a while. (Giles stops pouring) I haven't been training ... and I haven't really needed to come to you for help."
GILES,(sadly) I agree. (sets down the teapot)
BUFFY,"(gestures helplessly, gets up to pace) And then this whole thing with Dracula ... it made me face up to some stuff. (Giles looks concerned) Ever since we did that spell where we called on the first slayer ... I've been going out a lot. (Giles looks surprised) Every night."
GILES,Patrolling?
BUFFY,Hunting. That's ... what Dracula called it. (pacing)  And he was right. He understood my power better than I do. He saw darkness in it.
BUFFY,"(sits down again) I need to know more. About where I come from, about the other slayers. I mean, maybe ... maybe if I could learn to control this thing, I could be stronger, I could be better. But ... I'm scared. I know it's gonna be hard. And I can't do it ... without you. I need your help. (pause) I need you to be my Watcher again."
BUFFY,"(sighs, laughs nervously) Boy, I just, I just keep talking, don't I? I'm sorry, you-you had something you wanted to say?"
GILES,(smiling) No ... it's nothing.
BUFFY,"I'm outta here. (Joyce comes onscreen, in the bedroom. Buffy moves offscreen but keeps talking) Riley and I are going to the movies."
JOYCE,Okay. Have a good time.
<u>BUFFY VO,What are you *doing* here?</u>
JOYCE,"Buffy? If you're going out, why don't you take your sister?"
Buffy and Dawn (in unison),Mom!
Executive Producer,Joss Whedon.
