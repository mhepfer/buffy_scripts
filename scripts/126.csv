XANDER,<br>  Hey.
BUFFY,<br>  (jumps) Sorry.
XANDER,"<br>    33 minutes. Since when do we go through all this trouble for one lousy vampire.     Excuse me, one lousy potential vampire."
BUFFY,<br>    Vampire by vampire. It's the only way I know how.
DAWN,<br>  I think this thing has a freakin' child lock on it.
BUFFY,<br>  Shh!
DAWN,"<br>  You know, I'm not the shortest one here. I don't know why I had to be in the   kid coffin."
BUFFY,"<br>  Look, I know it's my job&#151;"
XANDER,"<br>  No, no. I'm sorry. I wanna help. I guess I've been a bit stressed out lately.   I'm sorry I took it out on you."
BUFFY,<br>  No big. Been kinda stressed myself.
DAWN,"<br>  Well, the whole Willow sitch is not unstressifying.I mean she's here, but not   &quot;part of the gang&quot; here and hopefully not &quot;under my feet here   in another time dimension&quot; here."
BUFFY,"<br>    There's Willow. There's the looming humongo bad. And it's a school night.     I should be home in bed, cuddled up to my insomnia, and worrying about how     I'm gonna mess up tomorrow."
DAWN,<br>  You'll be fine. You'll be a great counselor.
BUFFY,<br>  It's my first week actually talking to the kids. What if their problems are   all weird and tricky?
XANDER,<br>  I think you underestimate your familiarity with the world of weird and tricky.   This job's perfect for you.

XANDER,"<br>  I don't know. Amateur opinion here, but she looks dead. I mean like natural   causes dead."
BUFFY,<br>  The paper said she had unusual cuts and contusions on her neck.
XANDER,<br>  Maybe she cut herself shaving and then died naturally of embarrassment.
DAWN,<br>  She looks...
BUFFY,<br>  Peaceful.
DEAD WOMAN,<br>  I am not peaceful.

WILLOW,"<br>  Absolutely! Those kids are lucky to have Buffy looking out for them. I just   wish she believed it. She's still stressing over the whole &quot;dropped out   of college, not actually qualified&quot; thing. Plus the salivating hellmouth   underneath her feet and the whole&#151;"

XANDER,"<br>    Yeah, I get that. Figuring out how to control your magic seems a lot like     hammering a nail. (Willow looks confused) Well, uh, hear me out. So you're     hammering, right? OK, well at the end of the hammer, you have the power, but     no control. It takes, like, two strokes to hit the nail in, or you could hit     your thumb."
WILLOW,<br>  Ouch.
XANDER,"<br>  So you choke up. Control, but no power. It could take like ten strokes to knock   the nail in. Power, control. It's a tradeoff."
WILLOW,<br>  That's actually not a bad analogy.
XANDER,<br>  Thanks.
WILLOW,"<br>    Except... I'm less worried about hitting my thumb, and more worried about     going all black-eyed baddy and bewitching that hammer into cracking my friends'     skulls open like coconuts."

TOUGH BOY,"<br>  Yeah, he's a man. I'm just all messed up right now."
