GILES VOICEOVER: Previously,
SPIKE,"Looks like I'm not as toothless as you thought, sweetheart."
BUFFY,How?
SPIKE,You came back wrong.
TARA,"Willow, you are using too much magic. What do you want me to do, just ... sit back and keep my mouth shut?"
WILLOW,"Well, that'd be a good start."
WILLOW,Forget.
TARA,I know you used that spell on me. What is wrong with you?
TARA,I don't think this is gonna work.
WILLOW,Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
BUFFY,Amy? How've you been?
AMY,Rat. You?
BUFFY,Dead.
AMY,Oh.
WILLOW,"It's nice, having another magically-inclined friend around."
WILLOW,"There's gotta be someplace, like, bigger than this."
AMY,It's way too early to go home yet.
JONATHAN,It's beautiful.
WARREN,"Boys, congratulations, Phase One of the plan is now complete."
SPIKE,I'm in love with you.
BUFFY,You're in love with pain.
SPIKE,Afraid I'm gonna-
DAWN,(yawning) What time is it?
TARA,"(looks at her watch) Almost seven. God, I just closed my eyes for a minute."
DAWN,"(squinting at the TV) Hm. And now there's cartoons. (frowns sleepily) Plus, a mother of all night-wedgies."
TARA,(looks around) Uh-oh.
DAWN,It's not tragic. I'm sure as soon as I stand up-
TARA,"No, Dawn ... why didn't anybody wake us up? Where is everyone?"
DAWN,Willow didn't come home either. They were out all night.
DAWN,Where are they?
TARA,"(walks closer) I'm sure they're fine, Dawnie. I'm sure they just ... lost track of time."
BUFFY,(frowning) When ... (looks down at Spike) When did the building fall down?
SPIKE,"(looks around, frowns) I don't know. (Buffy looking alarmed) Must have been sometime between the first time and the, uh..."
BUFFY,"Oh. (wincing, whining) Oh my god."
BUFFY,"Shoe, need my shoe. (looking around)"
SPIKE,"What's the hurry, luv?"
BUFFY,The hurry is I left Dawn all night. And don't call me love. (continues looking for shoe)
SPIKE,You didn't seem to take issue with that last night. (smirking) Or with any of the other little nasties we whispered.
BUFFY,(stands up) Can we not? Talk? (putting on her second shoe)
SPIKE,(sighs) I just don't see why you have to run off so quick. Thought we could- (waggling eyebrows)
BUFFY,Not gonna happen. Last night was the end of this freak show.
SPIKE,Don't say that.
BUFFY,"What did you think was gonna happen? What, we're gonna read the newspaper together, play footsie under the rubble?"
SPIKE,(softly) Not exactly what I had in mind.
BUFFY,Stop!
SPIKE,(grinning) Make me.
BUFFY,No! No!
BUFFY,"(pulling back) No, no, I-I have to-"
SPIKE,Stay. I'm stuck here. (looks upward) Sun's up.
SPIKE,I knew. I knew the only thing better than killing a slayer would be f-
BUFFY,What?!
BUFFY,Is that what this is about? Doing a slayer?
SPIKE,"(smirking) Well, I wouldn't throw stones, pet. You seem to be quite the groupie yourself."
BUFFY,Shut up. (wiping her mouth with the back of her hand)
SPIKE,I'm just sayin' ... vampires get you hot.
BUFFY,*A* vampire got me hot. One. But he's gone. You're just...
BUFFY,You're just convenient.
SPIKE,"(angrily) So, what now? You go back to treating me like dirt till the next time you get an itch you can't scratch? (Buffy just looks at him) Well, forget it. (fastening his belt) Last night changed things. I'm done being your whipping boy."
BUFFY,Nothing's changed. It was a mistake.
SPIKE,Bollocks! It was a bloody revelation.
SPIKE,"(walks closer to her) You can act as high and mighty as you like ... but I know where you live now, Slayer. (softly) I've tasted it."
BUFFY,Get a grip. Like you're god's gift.
SPIKE,"(chuckling) Hardly. (stops smiling) Wouldn't be nearly as interesting, would it?"
BUFFY,No! Let me go!
SPIKE,"I may be dirt ... but you're the one who likes to roll in it, Slayer. You never had it so good as me. Never."
BUFFY,"Uhh, you're bent. (moves past him to put on her jacket)"
SPIKE,"Yeah, and it made you scream, didn't it?"
BUFFY,"(very angrily) I swear to god, if you tell *anyone* about last night, I will kill you."
SPIKE,(skeptically) Right.
SPIKE,"You're gonna want these, too."
TARA,Pancakes?
DAWN,"Uh, sure. (goes to the fridge, takes out a carton of orange juice) Um, should we call Xander? What if they're all in a ditch somewhere? (closes fridge) Ditches are bad. Mom always used to talk about the ditches."
TARA,"Nobody's in a ditch. We'll call, but ... we'll give them some time before we wake them up."
TARA,"Funny shapes, or...? (sighs)"
WILLOW,It'll wear off in a day or-
WILLOW,(nervous) Hey.
TARA,"(nervous) Hey. I just ... B-Buffy didn't come home last night ... either, so..."
WILLOW,"Uh, hey, uh ... this is Amy. Amy, Tara, Tara, Amy."
AMY,(smiles) How you doin'?
TARA,"Fine, I ... I'd b-better g-get going. (turns to go)"
WILLOW,(to Tara) Amy! Amy the rat? (to Amy) Sorry.
AMY,"No, that's fair. I was a rat."
TARA,(confused) When...
AMY,"Last night. It's nuts, everything's different. I mean ... (grins at Willow) the Bronze, for one thing. (to Tara) And Willow! She's a freaking amazing witch now. (Tara looking upset) I couldn't even keep up with her last night."
WILLOW,Amy.
AMY,"No, it's true! (to Tara) I mean, I can do some transmography, but she is messing with dimensions and everything, it was awesome! This blowhard dude, first she made his mouth disappear? Thank god. And then-"
AMY,"I'm talking too much. Sorry. It's just been ... you know ... me and a bag of pellets for the last few years, so..."
TARA,"No, it's, it's fine. It's just, um, I, I re-really need to go. (turns to leave)"
WILLOW,"Tara, uh, you left some stuff upstairs, it's in-"
TARA,(walking away) I'll get them later.
WILLOW,Tara!
DAWN,"Buffy! Uh, where were you, are you okay?"
BUFFY,I'm fine.
DAWN,"You're not, you're all sore and limpy."
BUFFY,"I, I'm not ... sore, I just... (sits down with a grimace of pain) ... I had a fight, you know, the ... all-nighter kind."
DAWN,"Figured. I knew that's why you didn't call. So, what's the big bad? Uh, should we be worried?"
BUFFY,"No. I mean, I, I think you guys are, are safe. (to Willow) Tara was here?"
WILLOW,I guess she stayed over with Dawn.
BUFFY,You guess? Where were you?
WILLOW,"(indicates Amy) We went out, kinda lost track of time."
BUFFY,Oh.
WILLOW,I never would have if I knew you weren't coming home.
BUFFY,"No, o-of course, I mean, you know, it wasn't ... intentional. (Dawn listening) And, you know, everyone's safe. (to Dawn) You are, right? You're okay?"
DAWN,"Oh, yeah. I mean, um, I think my pancakes are burning, but..."
DAWN,(OS) Tara was making...
WILLOW,"(staring at the pancake) I've, uh ... I've gotta get some sleep."
BUFFY,Me too. (gets up painfully)
AMY,Yeah. (gets up) I should go home. Dad's expecting me.
WILLOW,Okay. I'll call you later.
AMY,"(going to the door) Yeah, good."
BUFFY,You sure you're all right? I'm sorry about everything.
DAWN,It's okay. You should rest. You're beat from monster-wrestling all night.
BUFFY,(quietly) Yeah. Right. (very quietly) Thanks.
WILLOW,"Yeah, I'm gonna crash too. Night Dawnie."
DAWN,No problem. I'll just ... (to herself) go find some awake people.
WILLOW,<I>Claudete.</I>
WILLOW,(louder) <I>Claudete!</I> (gestures)
XANDER,All these demons are starting to look alike. You got reptiles ... reptiles with horns ... reptiles with gills.
XANDER,"And I'm still finding nothing of the 'steal a diamond, freeze a guy' variety."
XANDER,"Ahn, would you hand me that one next to you?"
XANDER,"Great, we're not even married yet and already you've stopped listening to me."
XANDER,Anya!
ANYA,"I'm sorry, but this is pointless! (Buffy coming over) We've been researching forever, and we're not even close to finding out who robbed that museum."
BUFFY,What's up?
XANDER,Anya has a theory. She thinks that Martha Stewart froze that guy.
ANYA,Don't be ridiculous. Martha Stewart isn't a demon. (to Buffy) She's a witch.
XANDER,"Please, she- (pauses) Really?"
ANYA,Of course. Nobody could do that much decoupage without calling on the powers of darkness.
BUFFY,"Guys, while this is fascinating, we still have work to do."
ANYA,I know I do! (looking at bridal magazine) I can't decide whether to put my bridesmaids in cocktail dresses ... (Buffy and Xander rolling their eyes) ...or the traditional burlap with blood larva.
XANDER,The traditional what?
ANYA,"Well, I was a demon for a thousand years, you don't expect me to turn my back on all the ways of my people."
BUFFY,"Uh, can I weigh in on this whole me wearing larva-"
ANYA/XANDER,No.
ANYA,(to Xander) At least I'm not asking you to perform the groom's rite of self-flagellation.
BUFFY,"Uh, guys! There's something out there? (Anya and Xander looking embarrassed)"
XANDER,"There is. And as much as I hate to admit that my ... bizarre bride-to-be has a point ... we're gettin' nowhere here, Buff. Maybe it's time to try something new. You know? Hit the streets, get Spike on it."
BUFFY,"No! No, no Spike. And no hit the streets, we, we, we stay put, you know? Away from distractions. We'll figure this out."
ANYA,"What about Willow, can't she do something?"
BUFFY,Maybe. But she's home sleeping.
XANDER,Sleeping? She sick?
BUFFY,"No, she was out late. With Amy. (Xander looks annoyed)"
ANYA,And I'm bizarre. At least I didn't dump you to hang out with an ex-rat.
BUFFY,"No, it's not like that, you know, she's just ... helping Amy through a transition."
XANDER,And making herself a playmate to do magic with. Someone who won't monitor her like Tara.
BUFFY,"No, Willow's a grownup. You know, maybe she doesn't need to be monitored."
BUFFY,"You know, she's going through something, but we're not her. I mean ... m-maybe she has reasons for acting this way. (Anya staring at her) And, so what if she crossed a line? You know, we all do stuff. Stupid stuff. But, then we learn. And, and we learn, and, and we don't do it again. Okay, so, you know, who are we to get all judgey?"
XANDER,"Not judgey, Buff. Just, observey."
ANYA,"Yeah, all we're saying is, she's acting different. You know, she's not herself."
AMY,So what do you wanna do? It's gonna be hard to top last night.
WILLOW,"Yeah, I don't know if I can. I felt awful today, and I couldn't do magic. Took me all day to get my powers back. I think we should just take it easy."
AMY,(steps in front of her and stops) I have a better idea.
WILLOW,What?
AMY,"I know this guy ... and he knows spells that last for days. And the burnout factor is like, nothing."
WILLOW,Really? He's a warlock?
AMY,"I guess. Look, I am not kidding you. This guy ... will blow your mind. He will take you to places that you can't even imagine."
WILLOW,Is it dangerous?
AMY,Would that stop you?
AMY,This is it.
WILLOW,Where? I thought you said the guy lived around here.
AMY,He does. (stops walking) You can't feel it?
WILLOW,What do you-
AMY,Here.
WILLOW,It's hot.
AMY,Come on.
AMY,"It's cool, isn't it? The place is cloaked."
WILLOW,Yeah.
AMY,Moves around a lot too. Keeps Rack out of trouble.
WILLOW,"Rack, who's-"
GIRL,"(anxious) Rack, Rack, it's my turn."
GUY,"No, man, you said I was up."
GIRL,"Bull, I've been here for hours!"
RACK,I believe these two are next.
AMY,"Thanks, Rack, for taking us. (puts her jacket down) I know it's been a while. You'll never believe-"
RACK,You were a rat.
AMY,How did you know?
RACK,(chuckling) I hope that taught you not to mess with spells you can't handle. You should leave that in the hands of a professional.
RACK,Oh. This one's givin' off vibes. (walks closer)
WILLOW,"(nervous) I don't mean to ... vibe at you, I, if it's in a negative way."
RACK,"(walks around behind her) No, no, I-I mean you ... have power, girl, it's just (waving his hands around her body) coming off you in waves."
WILLOW,(embarrassed) Not so much.
WILLOW,"I mean, I-I can do stuff, but, I get tapped out quick, and I've used practically every spell I know."
RACK,And what do you want me to do about that?
WILLOW,"(uncertain) I-I don't know, I, I thought- (looks back at Amy) Amy said-"
RACK,Amy said. Amy said I could help you. But did Amy say how you could help me?
WILLOW,"No, I-I have some money, a-a bit-"
RACK,(shakes head) Not money.
WILLOW,"(nervous) Well, I could help you with your computer, I'm really handy-"
RACK,"Just relax, I'm not gonna hurt you. You gotta give a little to get a little, right?"
AMY,(whispers) It's okay. It's over fast.
RACK,That's right. I'm just gonna take a little tour.
RACK,You taste ... like strawberries.
Cut to,overhead shot of Sunnydale. The sun is setting.
Cut to,external shot of the Summers house.
DAWN,Ow.
DAWN,"Ow, ow! Ow. (sucks on her fingers)"
WILLOW,Or you could do it the hard way.
DAWN,Spatulas are for wimps. I'm making peanut-butter-and-banana quesadillas. You want?
WILLOW,"(opens fridge) No thanks. I'm, uh, more in water mode."
DAWN,Ow. Ow. Ow. You sure? It's my own brand-new invention.
WILLOW,"I'm sure. No, my ... tummy's feeling kinda rumbly."
DAWN,(mouth full) Your loss. Very delicious.
DAWN,Buffy called. She said she was going straight from the Magic Box to do some patrolling.
WILLOW,"Oh, did she need help?"
DAWN,"No, she was just calling to check in. For like the tenth time today. I think she's feeling all Joan Crawford 'cause of the other night."
WILLOW,"Yeah, about that, I'm ... I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have assumed Buffy would be here."
DAWN,"(smiling) Right. Assume would make you an ass out of me. Heh, um, or, uh, something. Anyway, please, it's cool. I mean, it's not like I even needed Tara to stay over. I'm so totally fine on my own."
DAWN,"(anxiously) But, you are gonna be around tonight, right? (eating)"
WILLOW,"(earnestly) Right, totally! Uh, we can do something if you want. A movie maybe?"
DAWN,(smiling) Really? But I thought you weren't feeling so good.
WILLOW,"Well ... nothing a little Dawnie time won't fix. (Dawn smiles) If you feel like baggin' the peanut butter, I'll even buy you dinner."
DAWN,Thank god! (picks up her plate) Remind me never to invent that again. Yecch.
WILLOW,"Great, this'll be great. I'll just grab the paper and see what's playing."
DAWN,I'll leave a note for Buffy on the refrigerator. That's the first place she goes after patrolling. She's such a pig after she kills things.
BUFFY,(calls) Hello?
BUFFY,Willow?
BUFFY,Dawn?
BUFFY,What's going on?
AMY,(nervous) Uh-oh. (nervous chuckle) Busted.
BUFFY,(shakes her) Where's Willow?
AMY,"(talking too fast, twitchy) She said - she said I, I-I could- (Buffy grabbing the thing she's holding) -wait!"
BUFFY,What is this?
AMY,"It's not what you think it is, it's sage!"
BUFFY,"That is what I think it is. (tosses it aside, grabs Amy again) What's going on? Where's Willow and Dawn?"
AMY,"I ... I saw - I saw her, but that was - I like your coat. When does the slayer find time to shop?"
BUFFY,"(shakes her again, slamming her against the wall) So they didn't let you in?"
AMY,(smiles nervously) Not that they know of.
BUFFY,What else did you take?
AMY,(shakes her head quickly) Nothing. (Buffy slams her against the wall again) Ow!
BUFFY,What else?!
AMY,"Please! Please, I need this stuff. Willow wants me to have it, she understands."
BUFFY,"Understands what? Breaking into someone's house for kitchen spices? (tosses the stuff aside) No, I don't think so."
AMY,"You should. She's as bad as I am, worse. (Buffy frowns) Bet she's at Rack's right now."
BUFFY,Rack's?
AMY,"A place. He does spells, heavy stuff. (resentfully) Willow's his new favorite."
BUFFY,She's there? (slams Amy against the wall again) With Dawn? (shakes Amy)
AMY,"(sickly) Ohh, don't shake me again, super strength. I think I'm gonna boot."
BUFFY,"Then tell me where this place is, and I won't."
AMY,"Well, it's downtown, but it moves."
BUFFY,"What do you mean, it moves?"
AMY,"It's downtown, I'm, I'm not sure where it would be tonight exactly-"
BUFFY,(shakes her) Tell me how to find it.
AMY,"You just kinda have to feel it out ... oh god, I think I'm gonna-"
WILLOW,"So, uh, the burger was good? You liked it?"
DAWN,"(smiling) Are you kidding? It was like a meat party in my mouth. (pauses) Okay, now I'm just a kid, and even *I* know that came out wrong. (Willow gives a small smile) Uh, it was good. But you should have had something."
WILLOW,"I will. I'll eat. I'm ... saving myself for popcorn. (pauses) The other day, you had fun?"
DAWN,"(frowns) Mm, what other day? Give me a Mon or a Fri here, something to work with."
WILLOW,The other day with Tara.
DAWN,"Oh! Uh, yeah. I-I mean, it was, it was nice. Uh, but it wasn't a laugh riot. She's sad and everything."
WILLOW,Did she say something?
DAWN,"Uh, not exactly. I can just tell, by the way she was acting."
WILLOW,Oh.
DAWN,"Uh, are you sure you're okay? You look a little-"
WILLOW,"No, I'm fine. And Tara's in her new place and everything, she's all settled in?"
DAWN,Um ... we really didn't get into ... well... (looking around) Is this right? I-is this the way to the movies?
WILLOW,"Oh yeah, I'm, uh, I just, uh, took you the long way around. But we're almost there. I, uh, just have to make one quick stop first."
DAWN,What is this place? Why is it hidden?
WILLOW,"I don't know, it's cool, isn't it? Okay, you just hang here for a minute ... and I'll, I'll be back. (starts to go, pauses) You want me to conjure you a magazine or something?"
DAWN,"Well, what about the movie? It starts at nine."
WILLOW,"(nodding, twitchy) We'll make it. I, I'll just be a minute. And it doesn't matter if we miss the trailers."
DAWN,(to herself) I like the trailers.
"Close shot of the clock, which reads 10",05.
RACK,"What do you think, strawberry? (magic sparkles on his hand) Can you handle some more?"
BUFFY,"God, do you sleep through anything? I was like yelling, and nothing. (puts candle down)"
SPIKE,I'm a bit knackered. Had a long night. (leers)
SPIKE,"Someone should teach you how to use candles in foreplay, luv."
BUFFY,Get dressed. Dawn's missing.
SPIKE,Again? Ever think about a Lojack for the girl? (Buffy just looks at him) What's the story?
BUFFY,She went out with Willow.
SPIKE,Willow? (grinning) That's kind of a sorry excuse to come by. If you want the touch all you need to do is-
BUFFY,"Spike. Willow's into something. Okay, her and Dawn have been missing for hours. There, there's some guy named Rack."
SPIKE,(frowns) Rack?
BUFFY,"Yeah, he's, uh, some sort of-"
SPIKE,"I know who he is, he deals in magic. Black stuff, dangerous."
BUFFY,I've been all over downtown and I can't find his place.
SPIKE,Because he cloaks it. You can't feel it unless you're into the big bad - a witch or a vampire or-
BUFFY,So let's go!
SPIKE,"(scoffs) Oh, that's right. Hide your blushing eyes."
Cut to Rack's place. Dawn still stands there fidgeting. She looks up at the clock. It now shows almost 11,00.
SLEAZY CIGARETTE GUY,"Hey, wait your turn."
WILLOW,Hey Dawnie. It's movie time.
DAWN,(angrily) Do you know how long I've been out here? It's too late for the movie. And that guy smells like-
DAWN,"(nervous) Are-are you, are you okay?"
WILLOW,Fine. Let's get outta here.
WILLOW,"So, what do you wanna do, cutie? (smiling)"
DAWN,(sullen) It's late. I just wanna go home.
WILLOW,"Uch! No way! I said we were gonna have fun, and we're gonna have fun."
DAWN,"(nervous) I'm serious, I think we should just get out of here."
WILLOW,"(mocking) ' I think we should just get out of here.' (another shot from behind) Come on, Dawnie, it's grownup time, do you wanna play with the grownups or not?"
DAWN,Why are you acting this way?
WILLOW,"Oh, don't get all weird on me, we're fine. Everything's fine."
BUFFY,Anything?
SPIKE,Not yet. I might pick up on it if you stop asking me about every two seconds.
BUFFY,"Spike, if you're dragging this out..."
SPIKE,"What, so I can linger near your precious self? Get a grip."
BUFFY,Like you've never drawn things out before.
SPIKE,"Maybe, but we've been through this, haven't we? Things have changed."
BUFFY,Will you quit that? The only thing that's different is that I'm disgusted with myself. That's the power of your charms. Last night ... was the most perverse ... degrading experience of my life.
SPIKE,(smiles fondly) Yeah. Me too. (resumes walking)
BUFFY,"(walks alongside him) That might be how you get off, but it's not my style."
SPIKE,"(scoffs) No, it's your calling. Gave me a run for my money, Slayer."
SPIKE,"Now, I admit it. You've had me by the short hairs. (softly) I love you. (glances at her) You know it. But I got my rocks back. You felt something last night."
BUFFY,Not love.
SPIKE,"Not yet. But I'm in your system now. You're gonna crave me, like I crave blood. And the next time you come crawling, if you don't stop being such a bitch, maybe I will bite you."
BUFFY,"(stares, stops walking) That, that's it! I want you out of my life! Out of my work, out of my home-"
SPIKE,"Too late for that. You invited me in already. (Buffy scowls) And as for your work, you need me. Like tonight."
BUFFY,I'll find Dawn myself.
SPIKE,(rolls eyes) You really gonna put your little sis in danger just to spite me?
DAWN,Willow. (shot of Willow staggering along) I'm serious. I'm going home.
WILLOW,"Uch, then go! God, I thought we were gonna hang."
DAWN,"(alarmed) Well, you're not coming with me?"
WILLOW,"Well, I don't know. (smiling) Maybe I could just, uh, pop you back!"
DAWN,With magic? (shakes head in disgust)
DAWN,What's that?
WILLOW,What? I didn't-
DAWN,Uh ... I'm getting out of here.
WILLOW,"Aw, Dawnie, don't. It was probably a cat or something like that."
WILLOW,"Oh, it's okay, he's not real."
DAWN,(scared) Seems real! Very! Real!
DEMON,"You summoned me, witch."
WILLOW,"(nervous, moving back) I, I didn't-"
DEMON,Did. You raised hell with your magicks.
DEMON,Fresh.
WILLOW,"Don't! She has nothing to do with it, it was me!"
DEMON,Yessss.
DAWN,He's coming! He's too fast!
WILLOW,Open!
WILLOW,Get in!
WILLOW,Close!
WILLOW,Drive!
DAWN,What are you doing?!
WILLOW,Woo! (laughing)
WILLOW,"(looking back over her shoulder) Take that, scuz-"
DAWN,Oh god.
BUFFY,Dawn!
BUFFY,(bemused) *Now* you're scared? (shrugs) Better late than never.
DAWN,"(OS) No, no!"
BUFFY,Dawn.
BUFFY,What happened? Are you okay?
DAWN,"(crying) Uh ... He was after Willow, she made the car drive, don't! (Buffy tries to look at her injured arm) No, don't!"
BUFFY,"I need to see, okay, let me see your arm."
WILLOW,"Dawn? Oh god, there's blood. (Dawn crying)"
BUFFY,"(to Spike) Okay, we need to get her to a doctor."
WILLOW,Is she okay? Is she okay?
BUFFY,"Back off, Will, I got her."
WILLOW,"No, Dawnie!"
BUFFY,"I mean it, stay away from her!"
WILLOW,"(crying) Dawnie! Dawnie, I'm so sorry! (Dawn glaring at her) I'm so sorry, it was an accident! I didn't see, I'm so, so sorry."
WILLOW,"(shocked) Dawnie! Dawnie, don't!"
WILLOW,"Dawnie, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
WILLOW,I'm sorry! I'm sorry... (crying)
BUFFY,(harshly) Get up.
WILLOW,"(crying) I screwed it up, everything, Tara..."
BUFFY,"(grabs Willow's arm, pulls her to her feet) Yeah, you know what, you did screw up, okay? You could have killed her! You almost did!"
WILLOW,"(crying) I know! I know! I can't stop, Buffy! I tried and I can't."
BUFFY,You can.
WILLOW,"(shakes head) I can't! I can't, I ju ... god, I need help. Please! (sobbing) Please help me, please."
WILLOW,Please.
WILLOW,Is she okay?
BUFFY,"She's sleeping. The E.R. doc gave her something for the pain, it knocked her out."
WILLOW,(anxious) But she's gonna be all right?
BUFFY,"It's a fracture. You know, it's gonna take some time."
WILLOW,"(looks away, whispers) God, I'm ... sorry. I'm so..."
BUFFY,"I just don't understand. I don't understand why you'd go to see somebody like Rack, and I certainly don't understand why you'd drag Dawn into it."
WILLOW,"I don't know. The magic, I ... I thought I had it under control, and then ... I didn't."
BUFFY,Because of Tara?
WILLOW,No. It started before she left. (pauses) It's why she left.
BUFFY,(pauses) Seemed like things were going so well.
WILLOW,"It was. But I mean ... if you could be ... you know, plain old Willow or super Willow, who would you be? (looks at Buffy) I guess you don't actually have an option on the whole super thing."
BUFFY,"Will, there's nothing wrong with you. You don't need magic to be special."
WILLOW,"Don't I? I mean, Buffy, who was I? Just ... some girl. Tara didn't even know that girl."
BUFFY,You are more than some girl. (walks into the room) And Tara wants you to stop. She loves you.
WILLOW,We don't know that.
BUFFY,I know that. I promise you.
WILLOW,"I just ... it took me away from myself, I was ... free."
BUFFY,"(looks down, pensive) I get that. More than you- (breaks off) But it's wrong. People get hurt."
WILLOW,If something had happened to Dawn tonight ... something worse...
BUFFY,I know.
WILLOW,"No, I don't think you do. I-I ... I was out of my mind, I ... I did things I can't even..."
WILLOW,"It won't happen again, I promise. No more spells. I'm finished."
BUFFY,(frowns) Good. I think it's right. To give it up. (pensive) No matter how good it feels.
WILLOW,It's not worth it. Not if it messes with the people I love.
WILLOW,The magic wasn't all great. I won't miss the nosebleeds and the headaches and stuff.
BUFFY,There you go.
WILLOW,Or ... keeping stinky yak cheese in my bra. (Buffy frowns) Don't ask.
BUFFY,Now I don't have to.
WILLOW,'Cause it's over.
BUFFY,Exactly. It's over.
