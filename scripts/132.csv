XANDER,"<br>    (exasperated) It's a loop...like the Mummy Hand. I'm doomed to replace these     windows for all eternity. You know, maybe we should just board these up until     things are less hellmouthy."
ANYA,"<br>    (holds up a notebook she was reading) Nothing...and nothing. (holds up two     other books, one in each hand) Cliff Notes to nothing. Nothing abridged..."
WILLOW,"<br>    (looks up from her computer) Yeah, my search isn't turning anything up either.     (to Buffy) Are you sure this thing called itself The First?"
BUFFY,"<br>    Pretty sure. It claimed to be the original evil, the one that came before     anything else."
ANYA,"<br>    (looking up over her reading glasses) Please, how many times have I heard     that line in my demon days? &quot;I'm so rotten, they don't even have a word     for it. I'm bad. Baddy bad bad bad. Does it make you horny?&quot; (everyone     stares at her) Or terrified. Whatever."
BUFFY,"<br>    It wasn't a line. When I came up against this thing, I felt it. It was ancient     and enormous. It nearly got Angel to kill himself. And if we don't rescue     Spike soon, God only knows what the First'll get him to do."
XANDER,"<br>    (looks over at Andrew, who's passed out, tied to a chair) I wish Sleeping     Ugly would come to. He's been out all night."
ANYA,"<br>    Yes, he was just starting to squeal when the spooky SWAT attacked. Said The     First was held up at the Seal of...Danzar something?"
DAWN,"<br>    (stands, walks to Andrew) Hmm. Maybe he's just faking so he doesn't have to     answer any more questions. (punches him in the face, stands back to observe)     Hm. Or maybe he's in a fugue state.(rears back to punch him again, but Buffy     interrupts)"
BUFFY,"<br>    Dawn."
DAWN,"<br>    What?"
BUFFY,"<br>    He'll come to when he comes to. Keep reading. If we're gonna rescue Spike,     we need to figure out how to fight this thing."
DAWN,"<br>    (pouts, goes back to the couch) Anya gets to hit him."
WILLOW,"<br>    Hey! Here, The First!...Bank of Delaware. Sorry."
BUFFY,"<br>    (sighs) Hand me the Watchers' Codex again. (someone hands her an old-looking     book)"
JOYCE,"<br>    Can I get you anything else, baby? (Buffy recognizes the voice and turns to     look) How 'bout some tea?"
BUFFY,"<br>    (searching her, shocked) Mom? (sighs, closes eyes) You're not real."
JOYCE,"<br>    (bends to Buffy's eye level) OK, is that, uh, slang, like you're not for real,     or&#151;?"
BUFFY,"<br>    (looks her in the eyes) You're The First."
JOYCE,"<br>    Oh, baby, you're so tired, you're not making sense. Maybe you should get some     sleep."
BUFFY,"<br>    No."
JOYCE,"<br>    You can't win against this thing. Not if you don't rest."
BUFFY,"<br>    (visibly shaken) Stop. Stop being like this. It's a lie."
JOYCE,"<br>    I don't want to scare you, but I want you to take care. (slowly) You need     to wake up."
BUFFY,"<br>    What?"
XANDER (O.S.),"<br>    You're dreaming. Buff, wake up."
BUFFY,"<br>    (having fallen asleep at the dining room table, she wakes) Hm? Did you see     it? (looks around)"
XANDER,"<br>    There's nothing to see. You were just doing a little dream talking, that's     all."

BUFFY,"<br>    The others were murdered."

BUFFY,"<br>    (resolute) I'm beyond tired. I'm beyond scared. I'm standing on the mouth     of hell, and it is gonna swallow me whole. And it'll choke on me. We're not     ready? They're not ready. They think we're gonna wait for the end to come,     like we always do. I'm done waiting. They want an apocalypse? Oh, we'll give     'em one. Anyone else who wants to run, do it now. 'Cause we just became an     army. We just declared war. From now on, we won't just face our worst fears,     we will seek them out. We will find them, and cut out their hearts one by     one, until The First shows itself for what it really is. And I'll kill it     myself. There is only one thing on this earth more powerful than evil, and     that's us. Any questions?"
