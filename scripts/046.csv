Buffy,Gotcha!
Angel,(defeated) Uhh! Right in the heart.
Buffy,(smiling) Satisfied?
Angel,I'm not sure that's the word.
Buffy,(taken aback) Okay.
Buffy,I didn't mean 'satisfied' like...
Angel,"No, I, I wasn't trying to..."
Buffy,(awkwardly) 'Cause we're not having satisfaction in the personal sense.
Angel,Of course. (exhales)
Buffy,(smiles) I should go. (walks past him) Giles is...
Angel,(turns with her) ...is waiting for you. (Buffy faces him) I know.
Buffy,(smiling) Thanks. For the workout.
Angel,"(nods) Um, am I gonna see you this weekend? You, uh, you-you probably have plans."
Buffy,"Right, birthday. Um, actually, I, I do have a thing."
Angel,"Oh, a thing. (trying to be cool) A date?"
Buffy,"(nods) Nice attempt at casual. Actually, I do have a date. (steps closer) Older man. Very handsome. He likes it when I call him 'Daddy'."
Angel,"(smiles) Huh, your father. (frowns) It is your father, right?"
Buffy,He's taking me to the ice show. (Angel sighs with relief) Which should be big fun. I could use a little fun.
Giles,This one?
Buffy,Amethyst.
Giles,Used for?
Buffy,Breath mints? (looks up at him)
Giles,"(exasperated) Charm bags, money spells, and for cleansing one's aura."
Buffy,"Okay, so how do you know if one's aura's dirty? Somebody come by with a finger and write (gestures with her crystal) 'wash me' on it?"
Giles,"(seriously) Buffy, I'm aware of your distaste for studying vibratory stones, but since it is part of your training, I would appreciate your glib-free attention."
Buffy,"Sorry. It's just with Faith on one of her unannounced walkabouts, I feel like somebody should be patrolling."
Giles,"(looks over the crystals) Well, Faith is not interested in proper training, so I must rely on you to keep up with yours."
Buffy,I hate being the good one.
Giles,"And as for patrolling, well, you'll be there soon enough. (suddenly curious) Why so anxious?"
Buffy,"I guess it... (suddenly self-conscious about her crystal, quickly puts it down) I just have some... energy to burn."
Giles,"Well, in due time, (puts his glasses on) but, uh, for the present, (selects the largest blue crystal) if it's not entirely beyond your capabilities, (sets it in front of Buffy) try to concentrate."
Buffy,"Wow, that was really funny-looking! (grins widely) Could you do it again?"
Vampire,I'll kill you for that. (jumps up)
Buffy,For that? What were you trying to kill me for before?
Buffy,"Okay, so here's the deal. (raises her stake)"
Vampire,Lemme know if I'm not doing this right.
Giles,Bit early in the day. (sips his coffee)
Buffy,"Giles, something's wrong."
Giles,(stops) Wrong?
Giles,Ah. Perhaps you shouldn't... (Buffy throws a knife and misses) ...do that anymore. (sets down his briefcase)
Buffy,"On top of that, I got a bad case of the dizzies last night and almost let a vamp stake me. With my own stake!"
Buffy,"I'm way off my game. (Giles sips again) My game's left the country. It's in Cuernavaca. Giles, what's going on here?"
Giles,"(sits) Well, perhaps you've got a bad flu bug or something."
Buffy,"No. No, not sick. I *can't* get sick. My dad's coming to take me to the ice show. We do it every year for my birthday. If I cancel, it's gonna break his heart."
Giles,"Well, just, um, take it easy for forty-eight hours. You know, forego patrolling until you feel yourself again."
Buffy,"No. No, I just need to spend a little more time training."
Buffy,I'm gone! (turns and leaves)
Giles,Thank you!
Xander,An ice show? A show performed on ice. And how old are we again?
Willow,I went to Snoopy On Ice when I was little. My dad took me backstage and I got so scared I threw up on Woodstock.
Buffy,"Look, I know you guys think it's just a big, dumb, girlie thing, but it's not. I mean, a lot of those skaters are Olympic medal winners. And every year my dad buys me cotton candy and one of those souvenir programs that has all the pictures, and okay, it's a big, dumb, girlie thing, but I love it."
Oz,"It's not so girlie. Ice is cool! It's water, but it's not."
Willow,"I think it's sweet you and your dad have a tradition. Especially now that he's not around so much. Ixnay on the caramel corn, though, if you go backstage."
Xander,"We're still talking party, right? I mean, some of us still love to relish celebrating in the birth of the Buff."
Buffy,I dunno. I think it might be time to put a moratorium on parties in my honor. They tend to go badly. Monsters crash. People die.
Willow,"But eighteen is a *big* one, Buffy. I mean, you can vote now. You can be drafted. (smiles) You can vote not to be drafted."
Buffy,I think I'll choose to celebrate this one with quiet reflection.
Xander,Where is it written that quiet reflection can't be combined with cake and funny hats?
Joyce,Buffy?
Buffy,Present.
Buffy,"Ooo, present!"
Joyce,"Uh, they're not. They're from your father."
Joyce,"His, uh, quarterly projections are unraveling and he can't afford to take off right now. He promises to make it up to you. It's all right there in the letter."
Joyce,"I-if you want, I could ask somebody to cover for me at the gallery. I-I mean, if you want me to take you."
Buffy,"No. No, that's not necessary. I-I was just thinking it might be nice to have a quiet birthday."
Quentin,"How much longer, Hobson?"
Hobson,"Five, maybe six hours, sir."
Quentin,"Once you finish, you and Blair can get some rest. But sleep in shifts."
Quentin,We're getting very close. The Slayer's preparation is nearly complete.
Buffy,"You know, it's not just cartoon characters. They do pieces from operas and ballets. Brian Boitano, doing Carmen, is a life changer. Oh, he doesn't actually play Carmen, but a lot of sophisticated people go."
Giles,"(absently) Yes, I think we should start with the grounding crystal again."
Buffy,"You know, it's usually something that families do together."
Giles,"Now, look very carefully for the tiny flaw at its core."
Buffy,"I-if someone were free, they'd take their daughters or their student... or their Slayer. (looks up at him hopefully)"
Giles,"Hmm? Yes, but, Buffy, I think we should concentrate now. Now, look for the flaw at its center."
Giles,Buffy?
Buffy,"Oh, I'm sorry. (rubs her temples) Did I zone out on you? It's just... I'm nursing that flu bug."
Giles,"It's best to take care of that. Perhaps we should, um..."
Buffy,"...call it a night. Yeah, (exhales) that's a good idea. Thanks."
Giles,Good night.
Buffy,"So, how's it going with Amy the rat?"
Willow,"(excited) Good! She loves her new exercise wheel. She runs around, her nose wiggles..."
Buffy,"(interrupts) I-I meant, how's it going changing her back into a human being?"
Willow,Oh. Still working on it. But I just got her the cutest little bell...
Boy,(upset) You don't do that to me! I waited for you at the Bronze all night!
Cordelia,And the big deal is?
Boy,You made me look like some kind of dork in front of my posse!
Cordelia,"First of all, 'posse'? Passe'! Second of all, anyone with a teaspoon of brains knows not to take my flirting seriously. Especially with my extenuating circumstances."
Boy,(confused) What circumstances?
Cordelia,Rebound! Look it up!
Boy,Hey! I'm not through here.
Buffy,"Oh, I beg to differ."
Cordelia,What is wrong with you?
Boy,Ow.
Boy,"God, the chick started it!"
Willow,(very concerned) Are you okay?
Buffy,"Okay, I just got swatted down by some no-neck and rescued by Cordelia. What the hell is happening?"
Giles,I'm sure it'll sort itself out.
Buffy,(desperate to know) You're not getting the big picture here. I-I have *no* strength. I have *no* coordination. I throw knives like...
Giles,(calmly) A girl?
Buffy,(confused by his reaction) Like I'm not the Slayer.
Giles,"Look, Buffy, I, I, I assure you, um... given time... w-w-we'll get to the bottom of, of whatever's causing this, um... anomaly."
Buffy,Promise me.
Giles,Yes. I give you my word.
Quentin,You're having doubts.
Quentin,Cruciamentum is not easy... for Slayer or Watcher. But it's been done this way for a dozen centuries. Whenever a Slayer turns eighteen. It's a time-honored rite of passage.
Giles,"It's an archaic exercise in cruelty. To lock her in this... tomb... weakened, defenseless. (looks at the crate behind him) And to unleash *that* on her."
Giles,"If any one of the Council still had actual contact with a Slayer, they would see, but I'm the one in the thick of it."
Quentin,Which is why you're not qualified to make this decision. You're too close.
Giles,That's not true.
Quentin,"A Slayer is not just physical prowess. She must have cunning, imagination, a confidence derived from self-reliance. And believe me, once this is all over, your Buffy will be stronger for it."
Giles,Or she'll be dead for it.
Quentin,"Rupert, if this girl is everything you say, then you've nothing to worry about."
Hobson,"(to Quentin) Uh, sir, if you can spare me for a short spell, I'll need to make a run to the hardware store. I just need some..."
Quentin,Take care of it.
Quentin,(impatient) Come on. Come on.
Blair,"Kralik, your pills. Open your mouth."
Quentin,That's enough. Close it up.
Willow,Aha! A curse on Slayers.
Willow,"Oh, no. Wait. I-it's lawyers."
Xander,"You know, maybe we're on the wrong track with the whole spell, curse and whammy thing. Maybe what we should be looking for is something like, um, (ahem) Slayer kryptonite."
Oz,Faulty metaphor. Kryptonite kills.
Xander,"You're assuming I meant the green kryptonite. I was referring, of course, to the red kryptonite, which drains Superman of his powers."
Oz,(thinks) Wrong. The gold kryptonite's the power-sucker. The red kryptonite mutates Superman into some sort of weird...
Buffy,(impatiently) Guys? Reality?
Willow,"Buffy. (they stop) I know you are *definitely*, without a doubt, gonna get your powers back."
Buffy,"Thanks, Will. (starts up to the stacks)"
Willow,But what if you don't?
Buffy,"(stops) Okay... (sighs) if I don't get my powers back, then I don't. I'll deal. (considers) And there's a whole lotta good sides to it."
Willow,"Actually, this could open up so many..."
Buffy,Giles. Did you find anything?
Giles,"(apologetically) Uh, no. Not yet."
Hobson,It's your shift.
Kralik,Pills!
Blair,(nervously) Yes.
Blair,It's coming!
Kralik,Pills!
Blair,Take them.
Kralik,Pills!
Blair,They're right in front of you.
Kralik,(sniffs) Where? (sniffs)
Blair,Here!
Kralik,I can't see... can't... (sticks out his tongue) can't reach it.
Blair,Open your eyes.
Kralik,Shh. Everything's okay now.
Buffy,(softly) Thank you. That's beautiful.
Angel,You really like it?
Buffy,Of course I do. It's sweet and thoughtful and... full of neat words to learn and say like 'wilt' and 'henceforth'.
Angel,Then why'd you seem more excited last year when you got a severed arm in a box?
Buffy,"I'm sorry. Uh, it's just suddenly there's this chance that my calling's a wrong number, and... it's just freaking me out a little."
Angel,That's understandable.
Buffy,"Angel, what if I have lost my power?"
Angel,You lived a long time without it. You can do it again.
Buffy,"I guess. But what if I can't? I've seen too much. I know what goes bump in the night. Not being able to fight it... What if I just hide under my bed, all scared and helpless? Or what if I just become pathetic? Hanging out at the old Slayer's home, talking people's ears off about my glory days, showing them Mr. Pointy, the stake I had bronzed."
Angel,"Buffy, you could never be helpless or boring, not even if you tried."
Buffy,Don't be so sure.
Buffy,"Before I was the Slayer, I was... (leans on the table) Well, I, I don't wanna say shallow, but... Let's say a certain person, who will remain nameless, we'll just call her Spordelia, looked like a classical philosopher next to me. Angel, if I'm not the Slayer, what do I do? What do I have to offer? Why would you like me?"
Angel,(quietly) I saw you before you became the Slayer.
Buffy,(confused) What?
Angel,"I watched you, and I saw you called. It was a bright afternoon out in front of your school. You walked down the steps... and... and I loved you."
Buffy,Why?
Angel,'Cause I could see your heart. (gets up) You held it before you for everyone to see. (walks to her) And I worried that it would be bruised or torn. And more than anything in my life I wanted to keep it safe... to warm it with my own.
Buffy,"That's beautiful. Or taken literally, incredibly gross."
Angel,"(grimacing) I was just thinking that, too."
Kralik,"Ah, you're up. I was afraid I drained you too much. I do that sometimes."
Kralik,Ever have a tune you can't get outta your head? It keeps playing over and over and over? Drives me nuts.
Kralik,Ahh. Thank you.
Kralik,Ohh. That... is much better.
Kralik,Mmm.
Kralik,"It's a game, you know. We're not gonna play by their rules, but... that doesn't mean we're not gonna play."
Kralik,Mmm. (points at Hobson's room) Why don't you call your friend in? We'll discuss it over dinner.
Giles,Quentin?
Giles,Hello? Quentin? Hob...
Man,"(to the other) Let's find out. (to Buffy's back) Hey, sweet girl! (Buffy stops cold) How much for a lap dance for me and my buddy?"
Buffy,"(wryly) Walk me home, Angel. No, I'm fine. I can take care of myself."
Buffy,Hummers. Big turnoff. I like guys that can remember the lyrics.
Kralik,"You know, I wish I could, but my mind just isn't what it used to be."
Buffy,Let me go.
Kralik,(playfully) You didn't say please!
Buffy,"HELP ME! SOMEBODY, PLEASE!"
Buffy,"HELP ME, PLEASE! SOMEBODY!"
Buffy,"SOMEBODY, PLEASE HELP ME!"
Buffy,"STOP! PLEASE, I NEED HELP!"
Buffy,"PLEASE, STOP!"
Giles,Hurry!
Buffy,"When I hit him, it felt like my arm was broken, it hurt so much. I can't be just a person. I can't be helpless like that. Giles, please, we have to figure out what's happening to me."
Giles,(with a shaky voice) It's an organic compound... of muscle relaxants and adrenal suppressers. The effect is temporary. You'll be yourself again in a few days.
Buffy,You?
Giles,"(shaky) It's a test, Buffy. (takes off his glasses) It's given to the Slayer once she... uh, well, if she reaches her eighteenth birthday. (swallows hard) The Slayer is disabled and then entrapped with a vampire foe whom she must defeat in order to pass the test. (paces toward his office) The vampire you were to face... has escaped. (stops at the door facing away) His name is Zackary Kralik. As a mortal, he murdered and tortured more than a dozen women before he was committed to an asylum for the criminally insane. When a vamp..."
Buffy,"(sobbing angrily) You bastard. All this time, you saw what it was doing to me. All this time, and you didn't say a word!"
Giles,(faces her) I wanted to.
Buffy,(sobs) Liar.
Giles,"In matters of tradition and protocol, I must answer to the Council."
Giles,My role in this... was very specific. I was to administer the injections and to direct you to the old boardinghouse on Prescott Lane.
Buffy,(crying and shaking her head) I can't... I can't hear this.
Giles,"Buffy, please."
Buffy,(looks him in the face) Who are you? (lowers her hands) How could you do this to me?
Giles,"I am deeply sorry, Buffy, (reaches out to her) and you have to understand..."
Buffy,"(shaking with hatred) If you touch me, I'll kill you."
Giles,"(imploringly) You have to listen to me. Because I've told you this, the test is invalidated. You will be safe now, I promise you. Now, whatever I have to do to deal with Kralik... and to win back your trust..."
Buffy,"(interrupts, sobbing) You stuck a needle in me. You poisoned me!"
Cordelia,What's going on?
Cordelia,"Oh, God. Is the world ending? I have to research a paper on Bosnia for tomorrow, but if the world's ending, I'm not gonna bother."
Giles,"(desperately) You can't walk home alone, Buffy. It isn't safe."
Buffy,(facing away) I don't know you.
Cordelia,(faces Giles) Did something take her memory? (turns to Buffy) He's Giles. Giiillles. (grins) He hangs out here a lot.
Buffy,"Cordelia, could you please drive me home?"
Cordelia,(surprised) Of course.
Cordelia,"(to Giles) But if the world doesn't end, I'm gonna need a note."
Joyce,Buffy?
Kralik,(grinning horribly) Mother.
Kralik,Mother.
Kralik,"May I call you Mother? (walks in front of her) My own mother was a person with no self-respect of her own, so she tried to take mine."
Kralik,"Ten years old, she had the scissors. You wouldn't believe what she took with those. (takes another pic) But she's dead to me now. (takes two more) Mostly (chuckles) because I killed and ate her, but also because I know I won't be alone much longer. (kneels by Joyce) I'll have your daughter. I won't kill her; I'll just make her like me. Different. She'll go to sleep, and when she wakes up, (gets into her face) your face will be the first thing she eats."
Kralik,I have a problem with mothers. (chuckles) I'm aware of that.
Giles,I was just trying to reach you.
Quentin,I was on watch over by the boardinghouse. (paces away)
Giles,Then you know what's happened.
Quentin,Yes.
Giles,"(angrily) He's killed Hobson and made Blair one of his own. Your perfectly controlled test seems to have spun rather impressively out of control, don't you think?"
Quentin,It changes nothing. (lifts the lid from the teapot)
Giles,"Well, then, allow me. (leans on his desk) I've told Buffy everything."
Quentin,(looks up from the teapot) That is in direct opposition to the Council's orders. (sets the lid back down)
Giles,"Yes. (crosses his arms) Interestingly, I don't give a rat's ass about the Council's orders. There will be no test."
Quentin,(pours a cup of tea) The test has already begun. Your Slayer entered the field of play about ten minutes ago.
Giles,"(stands up, surprised) Why?"
Quentin,I don't know. I returned there just as she entered.
Quentin,"Now Giles, we've no business..."
Giles,This is *not* business!
Kralik,Hide and seeeek...
Kralik,Hide and seek!
Kralik,Why did you come to the dark of the woods?
Kralik,To bring all these sweets to grandmother's house?
Kralik,"Oh-oh, no, no. Just a little lower. (nudges it down) Right... (inhales in ecstasy) Oh, yes. Yes. Oh. (gasps) Oooh! Thank you very much."
Kralik,"If you stray from the path, you will lose your way."
Kralik,(reassuringly) I won't take it all. I won't take it all.
Kralik,No! No! No!
Joyce,Buffy?
Joyce,"(muffled) Buffy, we have to get out..."
Kralik,Where are they? Where are they?!
Kralik,You don't seem to understand your place in all of this. Do you have any idea...
Kralik,"Oh, my! (looks down at the glass in his hand) What have you..."
Kralik,My pills!
Kralik,No. No...
Buffy,"If I was at full Slayer power, I'd be punning right about now."
Kralik,No! No!
Joyce,"(breathing heavily) Buffy, thank God you're okay. Oh, that man..."
Buffy,(straining) I can't get these. They're too tight.
Joyce,Can't you just...
Buffy,Not right now. (looks around) Maybe there's some clippers around.
Joyce,"Oh, Buffy!"
Quentin,"Congratulations, you passed."
Quentin,You exhibited extraordinary courage and clearheadedness in battle. The Council is very pleased.
Buffy,(deadpan) Do I get a gold star?
Quentin,I understand that you're upset...
Buffy,"(with controlled fury) You understand *nothing*. You set that monster loose, and he came after my mother."
Quentin,You think the test was unfair?
Buffy,I think you better leave town before I get my strength back.
Quentin,"(evenly) We're not in the business of fair, Miss Summers, we're fighting a war."
Giles,You're *waging* a war. She's fighting it. There is a difference.
Quentin,"Mr. Giles, if you don't mind..."
Giles,The test is done. We're finished.
Quentin,"Not quite. She passed. You didn't. (faces him) The Slayer is not the only one who must perform in this situation. I've recommended to the Council, and they've agreed, that you be relieved of your duties as Watcher immediately. You're fired."
Giles,(taken aback) On what grounds?
Quentin,"Your affection for your charge has rendered you incapable of clear and impartial judgment. (Buffy looks at Giles) You have a father's love for the child, and that is useless to the cause. (Giles looks down) It would be best if you had no further contact with the Slayer."
Giles,(with hostility) I'm not going anywhere.
Quentin,"No, well, I didn't expect you would adhere to that. However, if you interfere with the new Watcher, or countermand his authority in any way, you will be dealt with. Are we clear?"
Giles,"Oh, we're very clear."
Quentin,(bows slightly to Buffy) Congratulations again.
Buffy,(vehemently) Bite me.
Quentin,"(chuckles ruefully) Yes, well, colorful girl."
Willow,I can't believe Giles was fired. How could Giles get fired?
Oz,"So, how did you manage to kill Kralik?"
Joyce,"(smiles) Oh, she was very clever."
Joyce,"Uh, you go ahead and tell it, dear. You tell it better."
Willow,"Now, now when you say 'fired', do you mean 'fired'?"
Xander,"You're not cruising past that concept any time soon, are you?"
Willow,"Well, it's just... I mean, he's been *fired*! He's, he's unemployed! He's... between jobs."
Buffy,"Giles isn't going anywhere, Will. He's still librarian."
Willow,"Okay, but I'm writing an angry letter."
Buffy,"You know, nothing's really gonna change. The important thing is that I kept up my special birthday tradition of gut-wrenching misery and horror."
Oz,Bright side to everything.
Buffy,(sighs) Just feel better when I get my strength back.
Xander,"Give you a hand with that, little lady?"
Buffy,You're loving this far too much.
Xander,Admit it. (tries to open it) Sometimes you just need a big strong man. (smiles)
Xander,"Uh, Will, gimme a hand with that?"
