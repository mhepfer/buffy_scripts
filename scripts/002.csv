Willow,No! Get off!
Buffy,Hey!
Willow,Xander!
Willow,"Xander, are you okay?"
Xander,"Man, something hit me."
Buffy,Where's Jesse?
Willow,I don't know! They surrounded us.
Xander,That girl grabbed him and took off.
Buffy,Which way?
Xander,I don't know.
Buffy,(whispers) Jesse.
Wolf,Howl.
Giles,"This world is older than any of you know. Contrary to popular mythology, it did not begin as a paradise. For untold eons demons walked the Earth. They made it their home, their... their Hell. But in time they lost their purchase on this reality. The way was made for mortal animals, for, for man. All that remains of the old ones are vestiges, certain magicks, certain creatures."
Buffy,And vampires.
Xander,"Okay, this is where I have a problem. See, because we're talking about vampires. We're having a *talk* with vampires in it."
Willow,Isn't that what we saw last night?
Buffy,"No. No, th-those weren't vampires, those were just guys in thundering need of a facial. Or maybe they had rabies. It could have been rabies. A-and that guy turning to dust? Just a trick of light. (Xander gives her a look) That's exactly what I said the first time I saw a vampire. Well, after I was done with the screaming part."
Willow,"Oh, I-I need to sit down."
Buffy,You are sitting down.
Willow,Oh. Good for me.
Xander,So vampires are demons?
Giles,"The books tell the last demon to leave this reality fed off a human, mixed their blood. He was a human form possessed, infected by the demon's soul. He bit another, and another, and so they walk the Earth, feeding... Killing some, mixing their blood with others to make more of their kind. Waiting for the animals to die out, and the old ones to return."
Luke,Move!
Master,Is this for me?
Luke,"An offering, Master."
Darla,He's a good one! His blood is pure!
Master,(draws the obvious conclusion) You've tasted it.
Master,I'm your... faithful dog. You bring me scraps.
Darla,"I, I didn't mean it--"
Master,"I have waited. For three score years I have waited. While you come and go I am stuck here, here in this house of... (with extreme contempt) worship! My ascension is almost at hand. Pray that when it comes... (takes Darla by the neck) I'm in a better mood."
Darla,"Master, forgive me! We had more offerings, but there was trouble. A girl!"
Luke,And there was a girl. She fought well and she knew of our breed. It is possible that she may be...
Master,A Slayer!
Xander,And that would be a what?
Giles,"For as long as there have been vampires, there's been the Slayer. One girl in all the world, a Chosen One."
Buffy,He loves doing this part.
Giles,"Alright. The Slayer hunts vampires, Buffy is a Slayer, don't tell anyone. Well, I think that's all the vampire information you need."
Xander,Except for one thing: how do you kill them?
Buffy,"*You* don't, *I* do."
Xander,"Well, Jesse's my--"
Buffy,(interrupts) Jesse is *my* responsibility. I let him get taken.
Xander,That's not true.
Willow,"If you hadn't shown up they would have taken us, too. Does anybody mind if I pass out?"
Buffy,Breathe.
Willow,Breathe.
Buffy,"Breathe. (to Giles) This big guy, Luke. He talked about an offering to the Master. Now, I don't know what or who, but if they weren't just feeding then Jesse may still be alive. I'm gonna find him."
Willow,"Uh, this may be the dumb question, but shouldn't we call the police?"
Giles,"And they'd believe us, of course."
Willow,"Well, we don't have to say vampires. We, we could just say that there's a, a bad man."
Buffy,They couldn't handle it even of they did show up. They'd only come with guns.
Giles,You have no idea where they took Jesse?
Buffy,"I looked around, but soon as they got clear of the graveyard, they could have just, voom!"
Xander,They can fly?
Buffy,They can drive.
Xander,Oh.
Willow,I don't remember hearing a car.
Giles,"Let's take an enormous intuitive leap, shall we, and say they went underground."
Buffy,Vampires really jam on sewer systems. You can get anywhere in the entire town without catching any rays. But I didn't see any access around there.
Xander,"Well, there's an electrical tunnel that runs under the whole town."
Giles,"If we had a diagnostic of the tunnel system it might indicate a, a meeting place, it would, uh... I suppose we could go to the building commission."
Buffy,We *so* don't have time.
Willow,"Uh, guys? There may be another way."
Master,A Slayer! Have you any proof?
Luke,"Only that she fought me, and yet lives."
Master,"Hmm, very nearly proof enough. I can't remember the last time that happened."
Luke,1843. Madrid. He caught me sleeping.
Master,She mustn't be allowed to interfere with the Harvest!
Luke,I would never let that happen!
Master,Don't worry about it. I believe she'll come to us. We have something she wants.
Master,"If she is a Slayer, and this boy lives, she'll try to save him."
Luke,"I thought you nothing more than a meal, boy."
Luke,"Congratulations, you've just been upgraded. To bait."
Buffy,There it is.
Willow,That runs under the graveyard.
Xander,I don't see any access.
Giles,"So, all the city plans are just, uh, open to the public?"
Willow,"Um, well, i-in a way. I sort of stumbled onto them when I accidentally decrypted the city council's security system."
Xander,Someone's been naughty.
Buffy,"There's nothing here, this is useless!"
Giles,I think you're being a bit hard on yourself.
Buffy,"You're the one that told me that I wasn't prepared enough. Understatement! (exhales) I thought I was on top of everything, and then that monster, Luke, came out of nowhere..."
Xander,What?
Buffy,"He didn't come out of nowhere. He came from behind me. I was facing the entrance, he came from behind me, and he didn't follow me out. The access to the tunnels is in the mausoleum! The girl must have doubled back with Jesse after I got out! God! I am so mentally challenged!"
Xander,"So, what's the plan? We saddle up, right?"
Buffy,"There's no 'we', okay? I'm the Slayer, and you're not."
Xander,I knew you'd throw that back in my face.
Buffy,"Xander, this is deeply dangerous."
Xander,I'm inadequate. That's fine. I'm less than a man.
Willow,"Buffy, I'm not anxious to go into a dark place full of monsters. But I do want to help. I need to."
Giles,"Well, then help me. I've been researching this Harvest affair. It seems to be some sort of preordained massacre. Rivers of blood, Hell on Earth, quite charmless. I'm a bit fuzzy, however, on the details. It may be that you can wrest some information from that dread machine."
Giles,"That was a bit, um, British, wasn't it?"
Buffy,(smiles) Welcome to the New World.
Giles,(to Willow) I want you to go on the 'Net.
Willow,"Oh, sure, I can do that. (begins to type)"
Buffy,"Then I'm outta here. If Jesse's alive, I'll bring him back. (starts to leave)"
Giles,Do I have to tell you to be careful?
Buffy,We? (turns to face him) I... Me...
Buffy,"No! No, I'm... just admiring the fence. You know, this is quality fence work."
Buffy,Mr. Giles...
Buffy,"He asked me to get a book for him. Uh, from the store, 'cause I have a free period, and I'm a big reader. Did it mention that in my transcripts?"
Buffy,Ask him.
Buffy,We're clear.
Willow,"Murder, death, disaster. What else?"
Xander,"Paranormal, unexplained, did you get natural disasters?"
Willow,"Earthquake, flood."
Xander,Rain of Toads.
Willow,Right.
Xander,Rain of Toads! Do you think they'd have anything like that in the paper?
Willow,"I'll put it on the computer search. If it's in there, it'll turn up. Anything that'll lead us to vampires."
Xander,"And I, in the meantime, will help by standing around like an idiot."
Willow,"Not like an idiot, just... standing. Buffy doesn't want you getting hurt."
Willow,I don't want you getting hurt.
Xander,"This is just too much. I mean, yesterday my life's like, 'Uh-oh, pop quiz.' Today it's 'Rain of Toads'."
Willow,I know. And everyone else thinks it's just a normal day.
Xander,Nobody knows. It's like we've got this big secret.
Willow,"We do. That's what a secret is, when you know something other guys don't."
Xander,"Right. Look, maybe you should get to class. (indicates the door)"
Willow,You mean 'we'. We should get to class.
Xander,Yeah.
Willow,"Buffy'll be okay. Whatever's down there, I think she can handle it."
Xander,"Yeah, I do, too."
Willow,So do I!
Angel,(exhales)
Buffy,I don't suppose you've got a key on you?
Angel,They really don't like me dropping in.
Buffy,(faces him) Why not?
Angel,They really don't like me.
Buffy,How could that possibly be?
Angel,"I knew you'd figure out this entryway sooner or later. Actually, I thought it was gonna be a *little* sooner."
Buffy,"Sorry you had to wait. (exhales) Okay. Look, if you're gonna be popping up with this Cryptic Wise Man act on a regular basis, can you at least tell me your name?"
Angel,Angel.
Buffy,Angel. It's a pretty name.
Angel,Don't... go down there.
Buffy,(turns back) Deal with my going.
Angel,"You shouldn't be putting yourself at risk. Tonight is the Harvest. Unless you can prevent it, the Master walks."
Buffy,"Well, if this Harvest thing is such a suckfest, why don't *you* stop it?"
Angel,'Cause I'm afraid.
Angel,They'll be expecting you.
Buffy,I've got a friend down there. Or at least a potential friend. Do you know what it's like to have a friend?
Buffy,That wasn't supposed to be a stumper.
Angel,When you hit the tunnels head east towards the school. That's where you're likely to find them.
Buffy,You gonna wish me luck?
Angel,(whispers) Good luck!
Xander,Did you see anything?
Buffy,"(exhales in fright) Xander, what are you doing here?!"
Xander,Something stupid. I followed you.
Buffy,"Well, you--"
Xander,(interrupts) I couldn't just sit at home and do nothing.
Buffy,"I understand. Now, go away!"
Xander,No!
Buffy,"Xander, you're gonna have to."
Xander,"Look, Jesse's my bud, okay? If I can help him out, that's what I gotta do."
Xander,"Besides, it's this or chem class."
Xander,"Okay, so, crosses, garlic, stake through the heart."
Buffy,That'll get it done.
Xander,"Cool! Of course, I don't actually have any of those things."
Buffy,(hands him a cross) Good thinking.
Xander,"Well, the part of my brain that would tell me to bring that stuff is still busy telling me not to come down here. I have this, though. (turns on a flashlight)"
Buffy,Turn that off!
Xander,"(turns it off) Okay! Okay! So, what else?"
Buffy,What else what?
Xander,For vampire slayage.
Buffy,"Oh, fire, beheading, sunlight, holy water, the usual."
Xander,You've done some beheading in your time?
Buffy,"Oh, yeah. There was this time I was pinned down by this guy that played left tackle for varsity... Well, at least he used to before he was a vampire... Anyway, he had this really, really thick neck, and all I had was a little, little Exact-O knife..."
Buffy,You're not loving this story.
Xander,"No, actually, I find it oddly comforting."
Giles,'For they will gather and be gathered. From the Vessel pours life.' P... Pours life...
Giles,"'On the night of the crescent moon, the first past the solstice it will come...' Of course. That's tonight!"
Cordelia,No! It's supposed to find the syntax and match it. Or wait...
Harmony,Are we going to the Bronze tonight?
Cordelia,"No, we're going to the other cool place in Sunnydale."
Cordelia,Of course we're going to the Bronze. Friday night? No cover? But you should have been there last night. 'Cause I ran into Buffy...
Cordelia,...and can she be any weirder? She attacked me! Do you believe it?
Harmony,(exhales) I think we did this part wrong.
Cordelia,"Why do we have to devise these programs, isn't that what nerds are for? (whispers, indicating Willow) What'd she do?"
Harmony,"(to Cordelia) Uh, she's doing something else."
Cordelia,"Okay, and then pattern run, right? Or go to end? That's it!"
Harmony,Maybe!
Cordelia,"So anyway, I come outta the bathroom, and she comes running at me. Screaming! With a stick! 'I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!' I swear!"
Boy,Who?
Cordelia,Buffy!
Harmony,The new girl?
Boy,What's her deal?
Cordelia,"Well, she's crazed."
Harmony,Did you hear about her old school?
Harmony,Booted.
Cordelia,"Well, I exhibit no surprise."
Boy,Why was she kicked out?
Cordelia,"Uh, because she's a psycho loony!"
Willow,"(interjects) No, she's not."
Cordelia,What?
Willow,(turns to them) She's not a psycho. You don't even know her.
Cordelia,Excuse me? Who gave you permission to exist?
Cordelia,Do I horn in on your private discussions? No. Why? Because you're boring.
Harmony,"Okay, I think the program's done."
Cordelia,"Finally the nightmare ends! Okay, so how do we save it?"
Willow,Deliver.
Cordelia,Deliver? Where's that? (searches the keyboard) Oh!
Buffy,They're close.
Xander,How can you tell?
Buffy,No more rats.
Xander,Jesse!
Buffy,"Oh, no!"
Xander,J-J-Jesse!
Jesse,Xander!
Xander,"Jesse, man, are you okay?"
Jesse,"I am not okay, on an *epic* scale."
Jesse,We gotta get outta here!
Xander,"It's cool, Buffy's a superhero."
Buffy,Hold on... (breaks the shackles)
Xander,Do you think anyone heard that?
Jesse,They knew you were gonna come. They said that I... I was the bait.
Xander,"Oh, great, now you tell us."
Buffy,Oops!
Jesse,"Oh, no, no, no, no!"
Buffy,Do you know another way out?
Jesse,I dunno. Maybe. C'mon!
Jesse,"Wait, wait. They brought me through here, there, there should be a way up. I hope!"
Buffy,I don't think this is the way out!
Xander,We can't fight our way back through those things. What do we do?
Jesse,I got an idea. (vamps out) You can die!
Xander,"Jesse, man. I'm sorry."
Jesse,"Sorry? I feel good, Xander! I feel strong! I'm connected, man, to everything!"
Jesse,"I, I can hear the worms in the earth!"
Xander,That's a plus.
Jesse,I know what the Master wants. I'll serve his purpose. That means you die. And I feed.
Buffy,"(looks back at them) Xander, the cross!"
Xander,"Jesse, man. We're buds, don't you remember?"
Jesse,You're like a shadow to me now.
Xander,Then get outta my face.
Buffy,(to Xander) Help me!
Buffy,We need to get out of here!
Xander,There is no out of here!
Xander,Up there!
Buffy,Go!
Buffy,"Xander, pull!"
Master,She escaped? She walks free when I should be drinking her heart's blood right now? Careless...
Colin,"Master, we had her trapped!"
Master,"Oh, are you going to make excuses?"
Master,You are all weak. It has been too long since you have faced the Slayer. Huh. It is no matter to me. She will not stop the Harvest. Just means there'll be someone worth killing... when I reach the surface. Is Luke ready?
Colin,He waits.
Master,It's time. Bring him to me.
Master,"Ah, Colin... (Colin turns back) You failed me. Tell me you're  sorry."
Colin,I'm sorry!
Master,"There. That wasn't so bad, was it? Hold on..."
Master,You've got something in your eye.
Giles,Buffy?
Willow,It's just me. So there's no word?
Giles,"Ah, not as yet, no."
Willow,"Well, I-I'm sure they're... great."
Giles,Did you find anything of interest?
Willow,"I think, maybe... I surfed through the old newspapers around  the time of that big earthquake back in '37? And for several months  before there were a rash of murders. (hands him her printouts)"
Giles,"Great! I-I mean, well, not, not 'great' in a good way, uh, um,  uh, go on?"
Willow,"Well, they sound like the kind you were looking for. (flips  through the pages) Throats, blood... (looks squeamish)"
Giles,It's all coming together. I rather wish it weren't.
Master,My blood is your blood. My soul is your soul.
Luke,My body is your instrument.
Master,On this... most hallowed night... we are as one. Luke is the  Vessel!
Master,"Every soul he takes will feed me. And their souls will grant me the strength to free myself. Tonight I shall walk the Earth, and the stars themselves will hide!"
Willow,Did you find Jesse?
Xander,Yeah.
Willow,Was he dead?
Buffy,"Worse. (sits at the end of the table) I'm sorry, Willow. We were too late. And they were waiting for us."
Willow,At least you two are okay.
Xander,I don't like vampires. I'm gonna take a stand and say they're not good.
Buffy,"(turns to Giles) So, Giles! Got anything that can make this day any worse?"
Giles,How about the end of the world?
Buffy,Knew I could count on you.
Giles,"This is what we know. Some sixty years ago, a very old, very powerful vampire came to this shore, not just to feed."
Buffy,He came 'cause this town's a mystical who's it.
Giles,"Yes. The Spanish who first settled here called it 'Boca del Infierno'. Roughly translated, 'Hellmouth'. It's a sort of, um, portal between this reality and the next. This vampire hopes to open it."
Buffy,Bring the demons back.
Xander,End of the world.
Willow,"But he blew it! Or, I mean, there was an earthquake that swallowed half the town, and him, too."
Giles,"You see, opening dimensional portals is a tricky business. Odds are he got himself stuck, rather like a, uh, cork in a bottle."
Xander,And this Harvest thing is to get him out.
Giles,"It comes once in a century, on this night. The Master can draw power from one of his minions while it feeds. Enough power to break free and open the portal. The minion is called the Vessel, and he bears this symbol."
Buffy,"So, I dust anyone sporting that symbol, and no Harvest."
Giles,"Simply put, yes."
Buffy,Any idea where this little get-together is being held?
Giles,"There, there are a number of possibilities."
Xander,They're goin' to the Bronze.
Willow,Are you sure?
Xander,"Come on. All those tasty young morsels all over the place? Anyway, that's where Jesse's gonna be, trust me."
Giles,Then we should get there. The sun will be down before long.
Buffy,I gotta make a stop. Won't take long.
Giles,What for?
Buffy,Supplies.
Joyce,Buffy?
Buffy,Mom!
Joyce,You're going out?
Buffy,I have to. (puts on her jacket)
Joyce,I didn't hear you come in last night.
Buffy,I was really quiet.
Joyce,"It's happening again, isn't it? I got a call from your new principal. Says you missed some classes today?"
Buffy,I was running an errand.
Joyce,"We haven't finished unpacking, and I'm getting calls from the principal."
Buffy,"Mom, I promise, it is *not* gonna be like before. But I *have*  to go."
Joyce,No.
Buffy,Mom?!
Joyce,The tapes all say I should get used to saying it. No.
Buffy,"This is really, really important."
Joyce,I know. If you don't go out it'll be the end of the world. Everything is life or death when you're a sixteen-year-old girl.
Buffy,"Look, I don't have time to talk about this..."
Joyce,"Buffy, you've got all the time in the world, you're not going anywhere. Now, if you wanna stay up here and sulk, I won't hold it against you. But if you wanna come down, I'll make us some dinner."
Cordelia,"Senior boys are the only way to go. Guys from our grade, forget about it, they're children. Y'know? (they sit) Like Jesse. Did you see him last night, following me around like a little puppy dog. (they all giggle) You just wanna put him to sleep. But senior boys, hmm, they have mystery. They have... What's the word I'm searching for? Cars! I just am not the type to settle. Y'know? It's like when I go shopping. I have to have the most expensive thing. Not because it's expensive, but because it costs more."
Girl,"You know, I--"
Cordelia,"Hello, Miss Motormouth, can I get a sentence finished? Oh, I love this song! Come on!"
Lyrics,"<I>You fight the good fight / You fight the good war / You fight to be right / You fight to restore / Why should I believe a word that you say / It was just a game that you don't wanna play / And I say / It's wearing me down, I realize / It's all in my head now, now, and I realize / It's not what you've done / As much as what you've said / As what you've said / As what you've said / As what you've said</I>"
Cordelia,"Uh, what do you want?"
Cordelia,Hey! Hello! Caveman brain! What are you doing?
Jesse,Shut up!
Cordelia,"Well, just one dance."
Lyrics,<I>How are you feelin'? / Do you feel okay? / 'Cause I don't!</I>
Doorman,Need ID. (looks up) Hey! Nobody gets inside until I get some sorta--
Luke,(growls in the doorman's face) Get inside.
Lyrics,<I>How are you feelin'? / Do you feel okay? / 'Cause I don't!</I>
Luke,"Ladies and Gentlemen! There is no cause for alarm. Actually, there is cause for alarm. It just won't do any good."
Cordelia,I thought there wasn't any band tonight.
Luke,This is a glorious night! It is also the last one any of you shall ever see. Bring me the first.
Doorman,"What do you guys want, man, huh? You want money? Man, what's wrong with your faces?"
Luke,"Watch me, people. Fear is like an elixir. It's almost like blood."
Luke,Next!
Buffy,It's locked!
Giles,We're too late!
Buffy,Well I didn't know I was gonna get grounded!
Xander,Can you break it down?
Buffy,"No, not that thing. Um... You guys try the back entrance, and I'll find my own way."
Giles,Right. Come on.
Buffy,"Um, wait! Guys! Here! (hands Willow her bag) You get the exit cleared and the people out. That's all! Don't go Wild Bunch on me."
Giles,"Uh, see you inside, then."
Willow,No joy!
Xander,We've gotta get in there before Jesse does something stupider than usual.
Giles,"You listen to me! Jesse is dead! You have to remember that when you see him, you're not looking at your friend. You're looking at the thing that killed him."
Master,Almost free!
Master,Give me moooooore!
Jesse,This one's mine!
Darla,They're all for the Master.
Jesse,I don't get one?
Luke,I feel the Master's strength growing!
Luke,I feel him rising. Every soul brings him closer! I need another!
Buffy,(to herself) The Vessel.
Luke,Tonight is his ascension. Tonight will be history at its end! Yours is a glorious sacrifice! Degradation most holy. (no one in the crowd stirs) What? No volunteers?!
Darla,(brings him Cordelia) Here's a pretty one.
Buffy,"Oh, I'm sorry, were you in the middle of something?"
Luke,You!
Buffy,You didn't think I'd miss this. Did you?
Luke,I hoped you'd come.
Buffy,Be right down!
Buffy,"Okay, Vessel boy. (removes her jacket) You want blood?"
Luke,I want yours! (releases Cordelia) Only yours!
Buffy,(shrugs) Works for me.
Giles,Hurry!
Xander,(in a low voice) C'mon! Let's go! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!
Giles,(whispers) Hurry up! Come on! Through this door! Come on! This way!
Xander,Head's up!
Jesse,Hold still! You're not making this easy!
Xander,"Jesse, man! Don't make me do it."
Jesse,Buddy!
Luke,I always wanted to kill a Slayer!
Giles,One at a time! Quickly! Quickly!
Giles,We're going to have to open the front as well!
Xander,Jesse! I know there's still a part of you in there.
Jesse,(jumps up) Okay... Let's deal with this. Jesse was an excruciating loser who couldn't get a date with anyone in the sighted community! Look at me. I'm a new man!
Luke,Master! Taste of this... and be free!
Buffy,How'd it taste?
Willow,Get off of him!
Jesse,Ooo! Alright. Put me out of my misery. You don't have the guts.
Luke,"You forget, metal can't hurt me."
Buffy,"There's something you forgot about, too. Sunrise!"
Buffy,"It's in about nine hours, moron!"
Master,Noooooooo! Noooooooo!
Angel,She did it! I'll be damned!
Giles,I take it it's over.
Willow,Did we win?
Buffy,"Well, we averted the Apocalypse. I give us points for that."
Xander,One thing's for sure: nothing's ever gonna be the same.
Cordelia,"Well, I heard it was rival gangs. You know, fighting for turf? But all I can tell you is they were an ugly way of looking. And Buffy, like, knew them! Which is just too weird. I mean, I don't even remember that much, but I'm telling you, it was a freak show!"
Girl,"Oh, I wish I'd been there!"
Cordelia,You should have been there. It was so creepy...
Buffy,What exactly were you expecting?
Xander,"I don't know, something. I mean, the dead rose. We should at least have an assembly."
Giles,People have a tendency to rationalize what they can and forget what they can't.
Buffy,"Believe me, I've seen it happen."
Willow,"Well, I'll never forget it, none of it."
Giles,Good! Next time you'll be prepared.
Xander,Next time?
Willow,Next time is why?
Giles,We've prevented the Master from freeing himself and opening the Mouth of Hell. That's not to say he's going to stop trying. I'd say the fun is just beginning.
Willow,More vampires?
Giles,Not just vampires. The next threat we face may be something quite different.
Buffy,I can hardly wait!
Giles,"We're at the center of a mystical convergence here. We may, in fact, stand between the Earth and its total destruction."
Buffy,"Well, I gotta look on the bright side. Maybe I can still get kicked out of school!"
Xander,"Oh, yeah, that's a plan. 'Cause lots of schools aren't on Hellmouths."
Willow,Maybe you could blow something up. They're really strict about that.
Buffy,"I was thinking of a more subtle approach, y'know, like excessive not studying."
Giles,The Earth is doomed!
