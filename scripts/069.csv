character,dialogue
Willow,"I implore you, Neisa, blessed goddess of chance and fortune, heed my call.  Send to me the heart I desire."
Xander,"You know, magic at the poker table qualifies as cheating."
Willow,That wasn't magic.  I was praying.  Two please.
Anya,Five
Xander,"Ahn, I keep telling you: four's the max and only if you have an ace."
Anya,"Okay, four."
Xander,Let's see the ace.
Anya,(sighs) Three. (gives up the cards) What a stupid game.  All these rules just to win little plastic disks.
Xander,Chips.  They're called chips.  They represent money.  Since none of us has any money it represents money.  But that's gonna change once my merchandise hits the street.
Willow,"(munching on a pretzel) Hmm!  Wha'cha got in the boxes, drugs?  (then sternly) It's not drugs, is it, Xander?"
Xander,Not drugs.
Xander,"You are looking at the new local distributor for Boost Bars. 'The natural food bar that provides a nutritional energy boost for active, health-conscience people.'  (sits) Want one?"
Willow,No.  Thanks.  Those things usually taste . . kind of tasteless.  And then leave a bad after-tastelessness.
Xander,"(taking out a bar) Well, don't let the healthy scare you. Check out these ingredients.  (pointing at label) See?  Loaded with fatty goodness."
Anya,"Come on, somebody bet already.  I got three 'K' cards."
Xander,Wish the Buff could've made it.  This three-hand poker is not quite the game.
Willow,Guess she's out with Riley.  You know how it is with a spanking new boyfriend.
Anya,"(offhandedly while stacking her chips) Yes, we've enjoyed spanking."
Xander,"Well. . .(coughs) The thing is . . . I think Riley is . . . okay, in an oafish kind of way.  But . . . am I the only one with a big floating question mark over his head about this Initiative thing?"
Willow,"Well, they do seem to fall into the 'good guy' camp.  I mean they are anti-demon. (sees Anya's evil eye expression) Probably pro ex-demon."
Anya,Maybe.  I choose to feel threatened.
Xander,(gathering cards again) And why not?  There's still heaps we don't know about these commandos.  What exactly are they up to?
Walsh,(OS) Lights!
Walsh,It took the patrol team 42 minutes to track you and you neutralized them in 28 seconds.
Buffy,(glances at Riley behind Walsh) I was just lucky.
Walsh,I see. (Riley starts to smile) Well . . . still.  Very impressive.
Buffy,"I was just being modest with the whole 'lucky' thing.  You got that, right?"
Riley,I got it.
Graham,"Awesome, Buffy."
Forrest,Pfft! (he continues on)
Riley,(still smiling) See?  You're a hit.  Everybody loves you.
Buffy,"So then Professor Walsh said that I was just as amazing as Riley had said.  And later, he told me that she couldn't stop talking about this move I made where I used one of the commandos as a shield to block a taser blast.  It was like twelve-thousand volts.  It took the guy almost two hours to recover. (takes a sip of her coffee)"
Willow,(politely) Huh.
Buffy,Hmm.  How was your night?
Willow,"Like a normal person's.  Light on the action-pack.  Hope tonight's not too much of a let-down for you.  Excitementwise. (a pause) You do remember about tonight, right?"
Buffy,Bronze.  The gang.  Are you kidding?  I wouldn't be anywhere else.  I miss you guys.  We haven't been able to spend that much time together lately.
Willow,You've been busy.  Fighting armies and stuff.  Not to mention other distractions from a romantic-- (sees that Buffy's no longer paying attention)
Buffy,Riley just walked in.
Willow,Do ya want to let him know you're here?
Buffy,No.  Just enjoying a good stare. (eyes still on Riley) Tell me about your night.
Willow,"Well, spent most of it at Xander's teaching Anya to play poker."
Buffy,(still Riley-eyed) That sounds like fun.
Willow,Yeah.  Except the Anya part and the poker part.
Buffy,"Will, I think you better get used to-- a Twinkie!? (quick shot of Riley going to pay for his junk food) That's his lunch?  Oh, he is *so* gonna be punished."
Willow,(pouty) Everyone's getting spanked but me.
Buffy,What?
Willow,"Uh, nothing."
Spike,Hey!  Wipe your feet when you enter a person's home.
Giles,"(closing the door) Oh, yes.  Careless of me.  Tracking mud all over your, uh . . . mud."
Spike,"(looking around) I admit, it's a bit of a fixer-upper.  Needs a woman's touch. (looks at Giles) Care to have a crack at it?"
Giles,"While I'd loved to go on trading jabs with you, Spike, perhaps I'll come to the point.  As much as it pains me to say it, um, I owe you a debt of gratitude for the help you provided me in my recent . . . metamorphosis."
Spike,"(rubbing a crick out of his neck) Stuff the gratitude.  You owe me more than that, mate."
Giles,Three-hundred.  Count it if you'd (Spike snatches it out of his hand). . . like.
Spike,I'll do that.
Giles,"Um, thinking about your affliction and, uh, your newfound discovery that you can fight only demons; it occurs to me that (chuckling) I realize this is completely against your nature but I-I-I-- Has it occurred to you that there may be a higher purpose--"
Spike,Ugh!  You made me lose count. (faces him) What are you still doing here?
Giles,"Talking to myself, apparently."
Spike,"Well piss off, then. (indicates the money in his hands) This bit of business wraps up any I got with you and your Slayerettes. From here on I want nothing to do with the lot of you."
Giles,Your choosing to remain in Sunnydale might make that a little difficult.
Spike,Well you and yours will just have to show a little restraint is all.  Get out.
Spike,(following) And I don't want you crawling back here knocking on my door pleading for help the second Teen Witch's magic goes all wonky or little Xander cuts a new tooth.  We're through.  You got it?
Spike,(callously) Honeymoon is over.
Riley,(softly) You don't have to do this.
Buffy,I know.
Riley,"I mean, if you'd rather wait . . ."
Buffy,(meaningfully) I'm ready.  I want to.
Buffy,(eyes wide) My God.
Buffy,"You said it was big.  You told me, but you never said it was *huuuge*!"
Riley,(offhanded) I don't like to brag.
Buffy,"(looking down again) I had no idea.  This is incredible.  But not that I thought it was some fly-by-night operation. (turns to him, excited) Unless it is!  I mean, can you guys fly?  At night.  With those jet-pack things, do you have those?"
Riley,(playing coy) I can't really talk about it.
Buffy,This is unreal.
Walsh,"So, you like our little operation?"
Buffy,Yeah.  Yes.  It's very . . . clean.
Walsh,Your visitor's pass. (takes a few papers from her clipboard) And I've assembled some reading material to bring you up to speed.
Buffy,(frowns) Oh.  And I thought I was never gonna get homework from you again.
Walsh,You can't take that home.  That's classified material.  Highly sensitive. When you're through reading those pages you'll have to eat them.
Riley,(grinning) She's joking.
Walsh,"Don't worry, it doesn't happen very often.  Shall we?"
Walsh,Much of our hands-on research with the SHT's is performed here. We call this 'The Pit.'
Buffy,And what do you call those?
Riley,Tough.  It took eight of us to bring those two down.
Walsh,They'll be under our control soon enough. (calling down) Doctor Angleman!
Walsh,(to Buffy) Head of our science team.  He's a leader in the field of xenomorphic behavior modification.
Buffy,Behavior modification?
Walsh,We've made significant advances in reconditioning the sub-terrestrials.  Bringing them to a point where they no longer pose a threat.
Buffy,(to herself) So I've seen.
Buffy,. . . on the Discovery Channel.  With gorillas and sharks. They-they made them all nice.  You haven't seen it?
Buffy,What's over there?
Walsh,The armory.  You'll have to be cleared for use on each of these weapons.
Walsh,"(while this is happening) The more advance arsenal can be complicated, but I'm certain, in time, you'll pick that up. (looks over her shoulder and sees what Buffy's doing) Don't pick that up."
Buffy,What is it?
Walsh,About twenty-thousand dollars.
Riley,It's a prototype for a com-cam. (points to the monitor behind her) Communications camera.  Soon to be standard issue.  Gives us a direct comlink to Control when we're out in the field.
Walsh,"Also monitors the heart rate of the wearer.  A valuable tool for research in stress in combat condition.  If you'll follow me, I'll show you the SHT containment area."
Walsh,We have a few more things to give you.
Buffy,(pointing) What's in there?
Walsh,Research area.  Very restricted for security reasons.  Here is your security card and your pager.
Buffy,Been thinking about getting one of these.
Walsh,We're the only ones with the number and it stays that way.
Buffy,Right.
Walsh,"Lose either one of them and there's hell to pay and down here we mean that literally. (offers her hand and she actually smiles as she shakes Buffy's hand) Again, welcome to the team."
Willow,"This is so cool.  Wow.  I've been trying to find the dolls-eye crystal my entire life.  Well, since June, anyway.  Where'd you get it?"
Tara,"It-it was my grandma's, I think.  I found it a long time ago in my attic. (hesitantly) I-I want you to have it."
Willow,"Oh, no, Tara.  Th-that's really sweet.  I can't.  It's like a family heirloom.  I-I just wouldn't feel comfortable."
Willow,"But i-if you wanted to try out some spells with it some time, I wouldn't say no."
Tara,"(eager) Maybe tonight.  I mean, if you're not doing something you could . . come over and we could do something. (smiles)"
Willow,"(uncomfortable) Tonight . . . That sounds really nice.  But tonight I, uh, already have plans with people. Other."
Tara,"(hurt again) Oh.  Um, that's okay.  Another . . time."
Willow,"Absolutely.  It's just tonight, it-it's kind of a specific crowd.  You might feel out of place."
Tara,I better get to class.
Willow,"Well, um, I'll see ya later.  Okay?"
Angleman,How did the tour go?
Walsh,I'm not sure.  She's unpredictable.
Angleman,She's an unnecessary risk.
Walsh,Possibly.  How's our baby doing today?
Angleman,"Adjusting nicely.  Reflexes, motor-functions.  All off the charts."
Walsh,"That's what I like to hear. (to whatever she's looking at) Almost time to wake up, Adam."
Walsh,(soft voice) And take your first look at the world.  I know you're gonna make me proud.
Anya,"(indignantly) Xander.  You haven't been paying any attention to me, tonight.  Just peddling those process food breaks.  I don't know why."
Xander,"(around mouthful) Well, let me put it in a way you'll understand.  Sell bars.  Make money.  Take Anya nice places.  Buy pretty things."
Anya,"(considers) That does make sense.  All right, I support you.  Go sell more."
Xander,"Oh, well this was the only one I had on me.  Besides, it's getting late.  Maybe we should go."
Willow,Go?  You can't go.  Buffy hasn't gotten here yet.
Xander,"Let's face it, Will.  She's over an hour late.  She's probably out living the life of Riley.  I don't think she's coming."
Willow,She is! (unconvincingly) She said she was looking forward to spending quality time with just us. (brightens) See?  Here she comes.
Willow,(crestfallen) . . .with Riley . . . and some other guys.
Buffy,"Hi, all.  Sorry about the late-itude."
Xander,Late?  Really?  Huh.  Hadn't noticed.
Riley,Hope you don't mind us tagging along.
Willow,"(forced smile) No.  No, of course not.  The more the . . . more."
Riley,This is Graham.  This is Forrest.  That's Kevin.  And that's Jay in the back.
Graham,How you doing.
Riley,We're gonna go grab some drinks.  Anybody want anything?
Buffy,"Coke, please."
Willow,I'm good.
Xander,No.
Anya,(frowns) We're going away.  To dance.  Over there.
Xander,(being dragged away) We are?
Buffy,Anya seems a bit on edge.
Willow,She's a little angsty around commando-types.  Ex-demon issues.
Buffy,"Oh. (points to the guys) You know, I didn't think that you would mind.  Riley and the guys were throwing a little impromptu celebration in my honor and made it, like, impossible to not invite them."
Willow,"Oh.  That's neat about the celebrating.  I just thought this was supposed to be, you know, just us.  Just the scooby corps., you know.  I mean, I could have invited somebody else if I knew it was an open free-for-all."
Buffy,"I'm sorry.  I had no idea.  My *total* bad. (grins) So, who did you want to invite?"
Willow,What?
Buffy,You said you wanted to invite someone.
Willow,(nervously) No.  Not-- no one.  I meant a hypothetical someone which is to say no one.  What are we celebrating?
Buffy,"(lowers voice, but excited) I'm in.  The Initiative.  Professor Walsh gave me the grand tour and we're talking Grand as in Canyon! You'd never believe the size of it."
Willow,"That's really . . . again I say 'neat.'  So, what do you mean exactly?  You've joined them?"
Buffy,"No.  N-not exactly.  It just means that when I patrol I'll have a heavily armed team backing me up. (smiles) Plus, boyfriend going to work with me: big extra perk."
Willow,"Buffy, do you really think this is a good idea?  I mean, don't you think you're rushing things a little?"
Buffy,(frowns) I thought you liked Riley?
Willow,"Not with Riley.  With the Initiative.  I mean, there's a bunch of stuff about them we still don't know."
Buffy,I know that. (then) Like what?
Willow,"Well, what's their ultimate agenda?  I mean, okay, yeah, they-they neuter vampires and demons.  But then what?  Are they gonna reintegrate them into society?  Get them jobs as bagboys at Wal-Mart?"
Buffy,(in serious thought) Does Wal-Mart have bagboys?
Willow,"Plus, don't forget that '314' thing that Ethan told Giles about."
Buffy,"Well, a man that worships chaos and tries to kill you, is a man you can trust."
Willow,"Well, bad info or not, I just think there's certain questions you should ask before you go off and enlist."
Riley,That's us.  Let's go.
Willow,When did you get a pager?  What's going--?
Riley,That's our cue.  Mother wants us.
Buffy,(turns to Willow) Will . . .
Willow,I know.  Talk later.
Buffy,So what's the big emergency?
Walsh,"This is your objective.  Sub-T: 67119.  Demon class: Polgara species.  Though visual confirmation has not yet been made, we're confident of the target's approximate position as it leaves behind a distinct protein marker.  Dr. Angleman will brief you on its defenses."
Angleman,When threatened . . . bone skewers jut from the creature's forearms during battle.  It's imperative when ensnaring it not to damage its arms.  That's all you really need to know.
Buffy,Question.
Walsh,Buffy?
Buffy,"Why exactly can't we damage this polka thing's arms?  I, uh, not that I want to, it's just in my experience when fighting for your life body parts get damaged and-- better its bits than mine. (glances at the guys around her) Or . . . ours."
Angleman,We wish to study the physiology of every subterrestrial's natural defenses.  It's part of the research we do here. (before he can continue--) Uh-- Yes?
Buffy,What do they want?
Angleman,Want?
Buffy,"Why are they here?  Sacrifices, treasure, or they just get rampagy? (she is starting to get looks from the commandos) I find it's easier to predict their responses if I know--"
Angleman,"They're not sentient.  Just destructive, I believe."
Walsh,"They do have keen eyesight, however.  You might want to be suited up for this."
Buffy,"Oh. (glancing at the military green around her) You mean the cammo and stuff?  I thought about it but, I mean, it's gonna look all 'Private Benjamin.'"
Buffy,Don't worry I've patrolled in this halter many times.
Walsh,Why don't we give our attention to Dr. Angleman (Buffy raises hand) and save all questions until the end.
Angleman,"Actually, I'm finished."
Walsh,"Oh.  Uh, well, Agent Finn, deploy the teams."
Riley,"Okay, listen up.  We'll be going in a four squad set-up.  Team Leaders: Gates, Taggart, and Stavros.  Alpha Team, you're with me."
Walsh,"Report for TLs for assignment and weapons requisitions. Reminder: this is a zap-n-trap, people.  Capture not a kill.  Any questions?  (sees a raised hand) (sighing) Buffy."
Tara,Willow?
Willow,"(sheepishly) A funny thing happened with my prior social engagement.  Pretty much ended when a friend of mine went off to do something with another crowd she hangs out with.  Irony is kind of ironic that way. (hopefully) Anyway, I know it's late, but I-I thought maybe-- I mean, if you still wanted to . . . do something?"
Buffy,So I guess she hates me now.
Riley,(distracted) What?
Buffy,"Professor Walsh.  Questions.  An Initiative faux pas, yes?"
Riley,"It's . . . a little unusual.  She's just not used to it.  Maybe because you barely ever opened your mouth in her classroom.  But I know she likes you.  In fact, she liked you before I did."
Buffy,(hopeful) Really?
Riley,Told me so herself.
Buffy,Maybe I should get her a present or something--
Riley,"(stops) Buffy.  Can we talk about this later?  There's a dangerous hostile out here and . . . since I don't have your reflexes, I kinda need to focus."
Buffy,Right.  Right.
Buffy,What do you mean she liked me before you did?
Riley,(oops) Uh. . . .
Buffy,You didn't like me?
Forrest,(grumbling) It just isn't right.
Graham,"He made you team leader, didn't he?"
Forrest,That's not the point.  I've always been Riley's second in command.  Instead he picks a girl.
Graham,His girl.
Forrest,Whatever!  Three guesses on what that boy is thinking with.
Graham,Maybe he just wanted to give you a chance to get out from under his shadow?
Forrest,Hey!  I'm not under anybody's shadow.
Graham,"It was a joke, man.  Don't get your panties in a bunch.  I'm just saying-- (sees something through the goggles) Hang on.  Got something."
Forrest,Target?
Graham,Negative.
Forrest,"Hel-lo, Hostile 17."
Graham,(to commandos behind him) You two: standard flanking.  Go.
Forrest,(to Graham) Alert Control and Alpha Team.  We've tagged Hostile 17 with a tracer and we're in pursuit.
Commando,Sir.  Graham's on the talkie for you.  Reception's not too good.
Riley,"(into phone) This is Alpha Team, go ahead."
Riley,"Say again, Beta Team.  You're breaking up."
Buffy,Riley!
Buffy,So . . . what do you want to do now?
Giles,(over his shoulder) I don't know how many more ways I can say 'I'm not interested.'
Xander,"W-- try one!  Check these flavors.  Cherry-berry.  Maple walnut.  Ooo, almond licorice."
Anya,Ew.
Xander,"Anya, we don't say 'ew' in front of potential customers."
Anya,Just skip this part and tell him you want money to buy me pretty things.  He'll understand.
Giles,"(sighing) Very well.  Hmm, maple walnut."
Xander,An excellent choice.
Giles,(menacingly) Please leave my home now.
Xander,"It's the, uh, the gritty texture, isn't it?  Maybe you're more a cherry-berry fellow."
Spike,Close the door!
Xander,Spike?  You may want to give up these morning jogs.
Spike,Soldiers boys are out in force.  I've been trying to keep them off my scent.  Run them in circles.  But they keep coming.
Giles,And . . . how is this our concern?  Seeing as how you've expressed the desire to have nothing more to do with us.
Giles,Mm-hmm.
Xander,(to Spike with feeling) . . . That hurts.
Spike,(exasperated) All right.  What do you want me to say?  I need help. (points at Giles) And no cheek from you.
Spike,(shrugs his coat off his shoulder) Look!  The buggers shot me. In the back.
Giles,Remind me.  Why should I help you?
Spike,(scoff) Because you do that.  You're the goody-good guys. You're the bloody freaking cavalry.
Giles,"No, you can come up with a better answer than that.  Why should *I* help *you*?"
Spike,"(thinks) Ooh! Because I helped you!  When you turned into that Fyarl demon, I helped you, didn't I? (smug)"
Giles,"And that was out of the, um, evilness of your heart?"
Spike,"(grinning) Oh, hell no.  I made you pay me-- (stops grinning and looks at Giles' stoic, but hard, expression) You right bastard. (he digs out the money from his coat pocket and slams it into Giles' palm) That's all that's left.  I spent the rest on blood and smokes, which I'll never see again. (sees Xander and Anya still sitting) Ah, come on!  Circle the wagons.  Tend to the wounded here. No time for layabouts."
Riley,(smiling) Hey.  What's the matter?  Weren't expecting to see me?
Buffy,(relaxing again) I never know what to expect.
Buffy,(laughing) Your robot bird sounds hungry.
Riley,It's just a reminder to take my vitamins.
Buffy,(teasing) You're kidding.
Riley,Sorry.
Buffy,(starts to play with his short bangs with her fingers) Quite the regimental soldier.
Riley,I am how they trained me.
Buffy,They?  Who they?
Riley,"You know, the government.  Plucked me out of special op training for this."
Buffy,What did they tell you it was for?
Riley,They didn't.  In the military you learn to follow orders.  Not ask questions.
Buffy,I don't understand.  Aren't you curious about all the science and research stuff they're doing?
Riley,Hm.  I know all I need to know.  We're doing good here. Protecting the public.  Removing the subterrestrial threat.  It's work worth doing.
Buffy,What's 314?
Riley,(answers it) Riley.
Walsh,(VO) We have a situation.  You're needed.
Riley,On my way.
Buffy,What is it?
Riley,Don't know. (gets up)
Buffy,"You're really not one for asking questions, are you?"
Riley,(smiles) I'll leave that to you.
Walsh,"Lose your way, agent?"
Riley,No ma'am.
Walsh,"I've instructed Beta Team to suspend pursuit of Hostile 17 until your arrival.  I didn't want any slip-ups, that's why I'm putting you in charge. (hands him a piece of paper) You'll rendezvous with them at these coordinates."
Walsh,Riley. (he faces her) Make me proud.
Riley,"Yes, ma'am."
Walsh,(OS) I think we've got a situation.
Angleman,The Slayer?
Walsh,(begins to pace) She's becoming a liability.
Angleman,We knew that was a danger.  Does she know about the project?
Walsh,She knows it exists.  She already holds too much influence over Riley --over Agent Finn.
Angleman,We move to the contingency scenario?
Walsh,Right away.
Angleman,That's too bad.  She could have been a powerful ally.
Walsh,I know.
Angleman,And Finn will take it hard.
Walsh,That's why sooner is better.
Spike,Oww!  Watch it.  That hurts.
Giles,It doesn't appear to be a bullet.  It's too deeply embedded to be a tranquilizer dart.
Spike,(grumble) Also not tranquil.
Giles,Some sort of . . . illumination emanating from it.  It's blinking.
Spike,"I don't care if it's playing 'Rockin' the Casbah' on the bloody Jew's harp, (human growling) just get it out of me!"
Giles,"Anya, there's a bottle of Cognac in the cabinet next to the sink.  Can you get it for me?"
Spike,(as she leaves) What?  You're gonna get snockered now?
Giles,"It's not for me, you prat.  If I'm gonna operate on you then I need you in anesthetized.  It's going to take some time. (picks up a scalpel)"
Xander,We don't have any.  That blinking thing.  My pseudo-soldier memory bank tells me that's a tracer.
Giles,A what?
Spike,A what?
Xander,"It's like a homing beacon.  And if commando guys are reading the signal, they're coming home."
Giles,"Well, we need to buy some time.  It's in deep and I'm no surgeon."
Willow,"Oh, hi."
Buffy,"Hey. (indicating the bed) Out all night, huh?"
Willow,"You, too."
Buffy,Yeah.
Buffy,Sorry about bailing on you guys at the Bronze.
Willow,"That's okay.  I . . . (glances at the crystal, then to Buffy) Don't worry about it."
Buffy,(smiles) Okay.
Willow,"Wow, they really keep you hopping, don't they?"
Buffy,(clipping it to the waistband of her blue jeans) Yeah.  I gotta go.  I'll see ya?
Willow,Hello?
Giles,Willow.  You're there at last.  We have a problem.  Where's Buffy?
Willow,(cut to) Just left. (sarcastic) Beeped away by her new buds. You want me to go after her?
Giles,"(cut to) Uh, no, no.  It's your help I need, actually."
Willow,(cut to) Really?  What do you want me to do?
Walsh,"It's a small job.  Reconnaissance.  Probably a waste of a Slayer's abilities, but my boys are on assignment so I--"
Buffy,No.  It's okay.  I'm up for some action.
Walsh,I doubt you'll get any on this one.
Walsh,We have a reading of a class three subterrestrial moving through the sewer tunnels just on the edge of town.
Buffy,Class three?
Walsh,It's a low-level threat.  Minimal aggression.  Meager defenses.
Commando,Professor Walsh. (walks up and hands her a taser rifle)
Walsh,They barely show up on the scanner and occasionally turn out to be raccoons. (hands the weapon to Buffy)
Buffy,"(examining it) Wow.  You're not crazy about raccoons, huh?"
Walsh,We always take precautions. (picks up the com-cam from the table) All we need you to do is get a visual on this thing.  This will feed me back an image and I can advise you from there.  I don't want to put you in any unnecessary danger. (hands it to Buffy)
Buffy,Oh.  That's okay.  Danger's my birthright.
Buffy,"Sorry.  Um, Professor Walsh.  There's, uh-- There's still some stuff about all this that I'm not clear on."
Walsh,"(a beat) Well, when you get back we can have a talk."
Buffy,Good.  Okay.  When I get back. (turns to leave then stops) Am I supposed to salute you?
Walsh,No.
Buffy,Okay.
Willow,"(chanting spell) Tropo, strato, meso, aero, iono, exo . . ."
Xander,(to Giles) So how is this supposed to work again?
Giles,If she succeeds her spell will ionize the atmosphere around us thereby disrupting the tracer's signal.  (from Xander's 'duuuh?'  expression) Buys us time.
Willow,"(chanting) Elements are brought to bear.  Wind, earth, and water churn amidst the fire.  Let the air be burned."
Willow,(OS) Did it work?  Is the atmosphere ionized?
Giles,(deadpan) I'd venture yes.
Riley,"What do you mean, the signal's whacked?"
Forrest,I mean the blips a blob.  Some kind of interference messing with the tracer.
Riley,Try to lock it down.  We headed in the right general direction?
Forrest,(sighs) I think so.  It's gonna put us in populated areas.
Riley,"Okay, then.  We change into civvies and then move out.  Maybe something will turn up."
Buffy,"(into mic) Professor Walsh, are you getting this?  Possible SHT?  Make it a definite."
Buffy,And he's brought along a friend.  They seem--
Riley,"Talk to me, Forrest."
Forrest,Signal's somewhere in this neighborhood.  Estimate within a two-block radius.
Willow,"It feels, and looks, like the ionizing spell is wearing off."
Xander,Giles?
Giles,I've got it.  I've got it!
Riley,"Okay, we want to keep the hostile contained, so no one is to make a move without my--"
Forrest,(stops) Wait.  Signal's cleared up. (points across the street) There.
Riley,Let's go!
Giles,"Um, go!"
Riley,What?
Forrest,It's on the move.
Riley,Heading?
Forrest,Straight at us.  Forty meters and closing.  Moving fast.
Graham,In broad daylight?
Riley,Look alive people.  Weapons at the ready.
Forrest,Twenty-five meters . . . twenty . . . fifteen.
Riley,Where?
Forrest,To the left.  Ten meters . . . five!
Riley,Anyone?
Graham,I got nothing.
Forrest,This doesn't make sense.  It went right past us.
Riley,(disgusted) Flushed.  The tracers been flushed.
Riley,Regret to report Hostile 17 is still at large.  I left Beta Team to comb the area but the tracer's--
Walsh,"(interrupting) Riley, something's happened.  I-I don't know what to say.  It-it-it's about Buffy."
Riley,Buffy?
Walsh,"Two of our hostiles broke free and escaped into the tunnels. She . . .went after them on her own. (meets his eyes) She's dead, Riley."
Riley,(shocked) . . . . What?! (this transcript does not do justice to the amount of pain he puts into that one word)
Walsh,"I did everything I could to stop her.  I told her to wait for a back-up team, she kept insisting she didn't need any team.  She could handle it by herself.  I-I'm so, so sorry."
Riley,I don't understand.
Walsh,I know what she meant to you.
Riley,How could this happen?
Walsh,"She was a very, very special girl."
Walsh,I didn't understand at first.  But she had something.  I don't know . . . maybe I could have stopped her.
Walsh,It's hard not to blame myself.
Buffy,"(steely voice) Professor Walsh.  That simple little recon you sent me on . . . wasn't a raccoon. (Walsh slowly faces the monitors) Turns out it was me trapped in the sewers with a faulty weapon and two of your pet demons.  If you think that's enough to kill me, you really don't know what a Slayer is."
Buffy,Trust me when I say you're gonna find out.
Walsh,Riley . . .
Walsh,Agent Finn.  I order you to stop!
Walsh,Agent Finn!
Walsh,RILEY!!
Giles,It will be dark soon.  I think it will be wise for you to leave Sunnydale.
Spike,I'm not going anywhere.  Not until those bastards undo whatever they did to me.  Put me back the way I was.
Xander,(sarcastic) Sure.  Just explain to the nice scientist guys that you really miss killing and torturing innocent people.
Spike,Do you think that would work?
Giles,(removing his glasses) Spike-- lord knows why I'm telling you this-- it's for your own good.  As long as the Initiative is in operation it's not safe for you here.
Buffy,No.
Buffy,It's not safe for any of us.
Walsh,"(looking down at him) So.  All right.  Fine.  If she wants a fight, we'll give her one.  Won't we, Adam?  I've worked too long. Too long . . . to let some little bitch threaten this project. Threaten me. (she paces to the end of the table and puts a hand on Adam's boot) She has no idea who she's dealing with.  Once she's gone, Riley will come around.  He'll understand."
Walsh,"It's for the greater good.  He'll see that.  And if he doesn't . . . Well, first things first.  Remove the complication and when she least expects it--AHH!"
Walsh,(fading) Adam?
ADAM,Mommy.   </pre> </ul>
