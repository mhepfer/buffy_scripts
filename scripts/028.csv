Xander,"So, what do you think?"
Buffy,It's nice.
Xander,But do you think Cordelia will like it?
Buffy,I don't know.
Buffy,Does she know what one of these is?
Xander,"(chuckles) Okay, big yuks. When are you guys gonna stop making  fun of me for dating Cordelia?"
Buffy,"I'm sorry. But never. (Xander nods, smiles and looks down) I  just think you could find somebody more... better."
Xander,"Uh, parallel universe, maybe. (looks up) Here the only other  person I'm interested in is, um... unavailable. Besides, Cordy and I are  really getting along. We're not fighting as much, and yesterday we just  sat together, not even speakin'. You know, just, uh, enjoying  comfortable silence. (grins and laughs, then loses the grin and exhales)  Man, that was dull."
Buffy,(smiles) I'm glad that you guys are getting along. (facetiously)  Almost really. (reassuringly) And don't stress over the gift.
Xander,"Well, this is new territory for me. I mean, my valentines are  usually met with heartfelt restraining orders."
Buffy,She'll love it.
Xander,"I wish dating was like slaying: (steps away) you know, simple,  direct, stake to the heart, no muss, no fuss."
Buffy,"Sorry to say, Xand, slaying is a tad more perilous than dating."
Xander,"Well, you're obviously not dating Cordelia."
Cordelia,"Wait up. Hey, wait up! (jogs to catch up) Excuse me! Where's  the fire sale?"
Harmony,"Oh, sorry. Didn't see you."
Cordelia,"Well, why didn't you call me back last night? We need to talk  about our outfits for the dance. I'm gonna wear red and black, (points  at Kate) so you need to switch."
Kate,Red and black? Is that what Xander likes?
Cordelia,(confused) Xander? What does he have to do with this?
Harmony,"Well, a girl wants to look good for her geek."
Cordelia,Xander's just...
Harmony,(interrupts) When are you two gonna start wearing cute little  matching outfits? 'Cause I'm planning to vomit. (to the others) Let's  go.
Xander,"(holding his paper) Ha, ha, ha. This time I'm ready for you. No  'F' for Xander today. No, this baby's my ticket to a sweet D-minus."
Willow,"Hey, Amy."
Amy,Hey. (pulls on her backpack) Are you guys going to the Valentine's  Day dance at the Bronze? I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.
Buffy,Go ahead. You know you wanna say it.
Willow,My boyfriend's in the band!
Amy,(smiles and laughs) Cool.
Buffy,I think you've now told everybody.
Willow,Only in this hemisphere. (pulls on her pack)
Amy,(to Buffy) What about you?
Buffy,"(waves her off) Oh, Valentine's Day is just a cheap gimmick to  sell cards and chocolate."
Amy,"Bad breakup, huh?"
Buffy,"Believe me when I say, 'uh-huh'."
Willow,I just hate to think of you solo on Valentine's Day.
Buffy,I'll be fine. Mom and I are gonna have a pig-out and vid fest.  It's a time-honored tradition among the loveless.
Xander,(catches up) Did you guys see that? (points at Amy)
Buffy,See what?
Xander,In class. I think Amy just worked some magic on Ms. Beakman.
Buffy,You mean like witchcraft?
Willow,"You know, her mom's a witch."
Buffy,And an amateur psycho. Amy's the last person that should be  messing with that stuff.
Xander,Maybe I should go talk to her.
Giles,Buffy! (approaches them) Buffy... Might I have a word?
Buffy,"Have a sentence, even."
Giles,"(gets the joke) Oh. Good. Well, uh..."
Jenny,(to the student) Back it up before you leave.
Jenny,Rupert.
Giles,Ms. Calendar. (looks down)
Jenny,"I'm glad we ran into each other, actually. I was hoping that we  could, uh... (gestures toward her room) Do you have a minute? (fidgets  with her hands)"
Giles,"Um... (making excuses) Actually, not, not just now. Um, (ahem)  I, uh, have a matter to discuss with, with Buffy."
Buffy,(calmly) Right. Let's go.
Buffy,Are you okay?
Giles,"(looks at her) Me? I-I-I'll be fine. (scratches his nose, then  pockets his hand again) Um, I was more concerned about you, actually.  Uh, since Angel, um... uh... turned... (sits on the table and folds his  hands) I've, um, been reading up on, on his earlier activities. Y'know,  uh, feeding patterns a-and the like."
Buffy,And?
Giles,"Around Valentine's Day, he, he, he's rather prone to, uh...  well, um, brutal displays of, uh... He would think of it as affection, I  suppose."
Buffy,Like what?
Giles,"No, no, uh, (gets up) no need to go into details. (steps away)"
Buffy,That bad?
Giles,"(faces her) Suffice it to say I, I think it would be best if you  stayed off the streets for a few nights. I-I-I'll, um... (sits across  from her) I'll patrol and keep an eye on things. (Buffy stares off into  space) Better safe than sorry."
Buffy,(looks over at him) It's a little late for both.
Spike,"Fancy it, pet?"
Drusilla,Ahhh. It's beautiful. Mm.
Spike,Nothing but the best for my gir...
Angelus,"Happy Valentine's Day, Dru."
Drusilla,Oh... (holds her hands over it) Angel!
Drusilla,It's still warm.
Angelus,I knew you'd like it. (inhales the aroma) I found it in a  quaint little shopgirl.
Angelus,Cute. (reaches around Drusilla's neck with it) Here.
Spike,I'll get it.
Angelus,"(looks up at Spike) Done. I know Dru gives you pity access,  but you have to admit it's so much easier when I do things for her.  (smiles)"
Spike,(controlling his anger) You would do well to worry less about  Dru (Angelus rolls his eyes) and more about that Slayer you've been  tramping around with.
Angelus,(paces behind the table) Dear Buffy. I'm still trying to  decide the best way to send my regards. (sits on the table)
Spike,Why don't you rip her lungs out? It might make an impression.
Angelus,Lacks... poetry.
Spike,It doesn't have to. (inhales and thinks) What rhymes with lungs?
Drusilla,"Don't worry, Spike. (looks back at Angelus) Angel always  knows... (looks at the heart) what speaks to a girl's heart."
Lyrics,<I>Feeling I've been lost for years</I>
Lyrics,<I>You can never understand me / Unless you've seen those tears /  But you never get to sleep</I>
Lyrics,<I>When I'm away / I don't mind / The deeper...</I>
Willow,"(to Xander, smiling) Oz has his cool hair today."
Lyrics,<I>...that you lay</I>
Willow,(excited) I think I'm a groupie! (looks back at the band)
Lyrics,<I>Out of time</I>
Lyrics,"<I>Pain, I can't sleep</I>"
Cordelia,"(smiles) Oh, hey!"
Lyrics,"<I>Pain, I can't sleep</I>"
Harmony,Let's get outta here.
Lyrics,<I>Running...</I>
Buffy,Here.
Buffy,(concerned) Mom?
Buffy,Mom?
Joyce,"Buffy, it's me."
Buffy,Yeah. You just startled me a little.
Joyce,"I was just checking the back door. (closes the door) Somebody,  um, left these for you."
Lyrics,"<I>Pain, I can't sleep / Pain, I can't sleep</I>"
Lyrics,"<I>Pain, I can't sleep</I>"
Xander,Hey.
Cordelia,(looks him up and down) Your clothes... You look so good.
Xander,"(looks down at himself) Oh. I let Buffy dress me. (gets a  confused look from Cordelia) Well, not physically."
Cordelia,"(upset) Perfect. You had to make this harder, didn't you?"
Xander,"Okay, clearly the fact that I please you visually has got us  off on the wrong foot here."
Cordelia,Xander...
Xander,"(stops her with a gesture) Let me finish. I've been thinking a  lot about us lately... the why and the wherefore. You know, once, twice,  a kissy here, a kissy there. And you can chalk it all up to hormones.  (Cordelia looks puzzled) A-and maybe that's all we have here. Tawdry  teen lust. But maybe not. Maybe something in you sees something special  inside me. (Cordelia looks down, then back up) And vice versa. I mean, I  think I do. See something. So..."
Cordelia,Xander... (opens the box) Thank you. (holds up the necklace  and pendant) It's beautiful. (exhales and looks at him) I wanna break  up.
Xander,"(looks at her in disbelief) Okay, not quite the reaction I was  looking for."
Cordelia,"(shaking her head) I know. I'm sorry. It's just... Who are we  kidding? (Xander looks down at the necklace) Even if parts of us do see  specialness, we don't fit."
Xander,"(looks up suddenly) Yeah! Okay... (very upset) Do you know  what's a good day to break up with somebody? Any day besides Valentine's  Day! I mean, what, were you running low on dramatic irony?"
Cordelia,(apologetically) I know. I didn't mean to do it this way.  I...
Xander,"(interrupts) Well, you did."
Jack,Dude. (pats Xander's shoulder) Way to get dumped.
Xander,"Ooo, Buffy, my bud, (takes her hand and stops her) you will not  believe..."
Buffy,(looks at him) Can't talk right now. Angel.
Xander,(lets go of her hand) Do you need help?
Buffy,It's alright.
Harmony,"Gee, Xander, maybe you should learn a second language so that  even more girls can reject you."
Amy,What are you doing?
Xander,Amy. Good to see you. (takes a quick look around) You're a  witch.
Amy,"(glances around) No, I'm not. That, that was my mom, remember?  (smiles)"
Xander,"Yeah, I'm thinking it runs in the family. I saw you working  that mojo on Ms. Beakman. (gestures behind himself) Maybe I should go  tell somebody about..."
Amy,That's not even... (angrily) That is so mean!
Xander,(glares back) Blackmail is such an ugly word.
Amy,I didn't say blackmail.
Xander,"Yeah, but I'm about to blackmail you, so I thought I'd bring it  up."
Amy,(folds her arms) What do you want?
Xander,"(chuckles) What do I want? I want some respect around here. I  want, for *once*, to come out ahead. I want the Hellmouth to be working  for me. You and me, Amy... (looks back at Cordelia sitting with Harmony  now) we're gonna cast a little spell."
Amy,A love spell?
Xander,"Yeah. You know, just the basic can't eat, can't sleep, can't  breathe anything but little old moi."
Amy,"Well, that kind of thing is the hardest! I mean, to make someone  love you for all eternity?"
Xander,"(waves his hand and shakes his head) Whoa! Whoa, back up. Who  said anything about eternity? A man can only talk self-tanning lotion  for so long before his head explodes."
Amy,"Well, then I don't get it. If you don't wanna be with her forever,  then what's the point?"
Xander,The point is I want her to want me. Desperately. So I can break  up with *her* and subject her to the same hell she's been puttin' *me*  through.
Amy,"(turns and steps away) Oh, I don't know, Xander. (turns back)  Intent has to be pure with love spells."
Xander,"Right. I intend revenge. Pure as the driven snow. Now, are you  gonna play, or do we need to have another chat about invisible homework?"
Amy,(considers) I'll need something of hers. (steps closer) A personal  object.
Xander,Alright. (smiles and leaves the room)
Buffy,"'Soon' what, Giles? You never held out on me until the big, bad  thing in the dark became my ex-honey."
Giles,(looks at the card) Where did this come from?
Buffy,"He said it with flowers. Look, this isn't the time to start  becoming Mr. Protective Guy. I can't just hang around, and I can't  prepare when I don't know what's coming."
Giles,"(sits up in his chair) N-no, of-of course, you're right.  (gestures to another chair) Uh, s-s-sit, sit down. (stands up)"
Xander,"Oh, come on, don't flatter yourself. I'm not gonna make a big  scene. I just want the necklace back."
Cordelia,(in disbelief) What? I thought it was a gift.
Xander,No. Last night it was a gift. Today it's scrap metal. Figure I  can melt it down and sell it for fillings or something.
Cordelia,You're pathetic!
Xander,"Come on, I'm not gonna add to the Cordelia Chase castoff  collection."
Cordelia,(glares at him) It's in my locker.
Xander,(points to her locker with his eyes) I can wait.
Cordelia,Here. It's a good thing we broke up. Now I don't have to  pretend I like it.
Amy,Diana... goddess of love and the hunt... I pray to thee. Let my  cries bind the heart of Xander's beloved. (lowers the necklace into the  brew) May she neither rest nor sleep (the brew sparks) until she submits  to his will only.
Amy,"Diana, bring about this love and bless it."
Amy,(to Xander) Blow out the candle now!
Cordelia,What?
Xander,"(confidently) Morning, ladies. (to Cordelia) Some kind of  weather we've been having, huh?"
Cordelia,"What do you want? You can't be sniffing around for more  jewelry to melt, because all you ever gave me was that Smallmart-looking  thing. (looks back down at her notebook)"
Xander,(chuckles and leans in to Cordelia) Is this love? 'Cause maybe  on you it doesn't look that different.
Cordelia,"(pushes him away) What are you doing? Are you going, like,  stalker-boy on me now?"
Xander,(confused) Sorry. My mistake.
Cordelia,"Yeah, I should say so."
Cordelia,What is his deal?
Giles,"Look, here's another. Here. Um, 'Valentine's Day.' Yes, uh...  'Angel nails a puppy to the...'"
Buffy,(interrupts) Skip it.
Giles,"Uh, but it..."
Buffy,I don't wanna know. I don't have a puppy. Skip it.
Giles,(closes the book) Right you are. I'll get another batch.
Xander,I have a plan: we use me as bait.
Buffy,You mean make Angel come after you?
Xander,"No, I mean chop me into little pieces and stick me on hooks for  fish to nibble at 'cause it would be more fun than *my* life."
Buffy,Yeah. (gets up) I heard about you and Cordy. That's her loss.  (leans on the table)
Xander,Yeah. Not really the popular theory.
Buffy,(looks up at him) You know what I'd like? Why don't you and I do  something together tonight? Just the two of us.
Xander,(does a double take) Really?
Buffy,Yeah. We can comfort each other.
Xander,"Well, would lap dancing enter into that scenario at all? 'Cause  I find that very comforting. (grins)"
Buffy,(smiles) Play your cards right...
Xander,"(stops her with his hand) Okay, uh... You do know that I'm  Xander, right?"
Buffy,"(looks down) I don't know, I just... (looks up) heard that you  and Cordy broke up, and I guess I was just surprised how glad I was.  (plays with his shirt) It's funny... (leans into him) how you can see  someone every day but not really see them. You know?"
Xander,"(smiles and chuckles nervously) Yeah, it's funny. And it's just  gettin' funnier."
Amy,"Xander, can I talk to you for a minute?"
Xander,"Yeah, okay."
Amy,Xander.
Xander,Yeah.
Amy,I don't think the spell worked out right.
Xander,"Oh, yeah, it bombed. No biggie. (grins)"
Amy,"Well, we can always try again."
Amy,I am still pretty new at this.
Xander,"Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. You know what? It was wrong to  meddle with the forces of darkness. I see that now. (Amy smiles at him)  I think we've all grown. I gotta go. (moves to go back in)"
Amy,"(stops him with her hand) Oh, we don't have to cast any spells."
Amy,We can just... hang out.
Xander,Sure. (looks at Amy) What?
Amy,"(smiles) Well, I liked spending time with you. You're so sweet.  You know, it's funny how you can... you can see a person every day  and..."
Xander,Not really see them.
Amy,"Exactly. So, anyway, I thought it might..."
Cordette,"Hi, Xander."
Xander,What?
Cordette,"You're in Mr. Baird's history class, right?"
Xander,Yeah.
Cordette,I thought maybe we could study together tonight.
Amy,(interrupts) Do you mind? We were talking.
Xander,"Uh, I really gotta go. Right now."
Willow,Sorry. I wanted to surprise you.
Xander,(grins nervously) Good job! High marks.
Willow,Don't be so jumpy. I've been in your bed before.
Xander,"Yeah, but Will, we were both in footy pajamas."
Willow,"Xand, I've been thinking."
Xander,"Will, I, I think I know what you've been thinking. But this is  all my fault. I cast a spell, and it sort of backfired."
Willow,(rubs the sheets) How long have we been friends?
Xander,"(very nervous) A long, long time. Too long to do anything that  might change that now."
Willow,"(moves to the edge of the bed) Well, friendships change all the  time. People grow apart. They grow closer. (smiles up at him)"
Xander,"Uh, this is good! How close we are now. I feel very comfortable  with this amount of closeness. In fact, (points behind himself) I can  even back up a few paces and still be happy. (steps back) See? (smiles,  still nervous)"
Willow,"I want you, Xander... (smiles) to be my first!"
Xander,(extremely nervous) Baseman. Please tell me we're talking  baseball.
Willow,Shhh.
Willow,We both know it's right. (leans into him for a kiss)
Xander,(backs his head away) It's not that I don't find you sexy.
Willow,"(leans away to look at him) Is it Oz? (shakes her head) Don't  worry about him. He's sweet, but... he's not you. (rubs his chest more)"
Xander,"Yes, he is. And you should go to him. 'Cause he's me. (grins)"
Xander,I-I don't wanna use force.
Willow,Mm. Force is okay!
Xander,Th-that's it! This has gotta stop. It's time for me to act like  a man. (opens the door behind him) And hide. (rushes out)
Cordelia,"Ha. Very funny. What did I do now, wear red and purple  together?"
Harmony,You know what you did. Xander is wounded because of you.
Cordelia,Are you tripping? I thought you wanted me to break up with  him!
Harmony,"Only a sick pup would let Xander get away, no matter what her  friends said."
Cordelia,What does it take to make you people happy?

Giles,(comes down the stairs) Xander. (looks at him) What is it? (sets  his books down)
Xander,"It, it's me... throwing myself at your mercy."
Giles,What? Why? (takes off his glasses to clean them)
Xander,"I made a mess, Giles. See, I found out that Amy's into  witchcraft, and I was hurt, I guess, so I... made her put the love  whammy on Cordy, but it backfired, and now every woman in Sunnydale  wants to make me her cuddle monkey, which may sound swell on paper,  but..."
Jenny,"Rupert, we need to talk. Hey, Xander. Nice shirt. (rubs his  shirt) Look, Rupert, I know that you're angry at me, and I don't blame  you, but I am not just gonna go away. (keeps rubbing Xander's arm) I  mean, I care far too much about you to... (looks at Xander's arm) Have  you been working out?"
Jenny,Oh!
Giles,I cannot believe that you are fool enough to do something like  this!
Xander,"Oh, no, I'm twice the fool it takes to do something like this."
Giles,"Has, uh... Has Amy tried to reverse the spell?"
Xander,I get around Amy and all she wants to do is talk honeymoon  plans.
Jenny,"(steps toward Xander) Rupert, maybe I need to talk to Xander  alone."
Giles,"(pushes her back) Do you have any idea how serious this is?  People under a-a love spell, Xander, are-are deadly. They lose all  capacity for reason."
Giles,"(to Xander) And if what you say is true and the entire female  population is affected, I... (sternly) Don't leave the library. (Jenny  keeps staring) I'll find Amy and see if we can put a stop to this thing."
Jenny,No!
Buffy,Alone at last.
Xander,"(stares open-mouthed) Buff, give me a heart attack!"
Buffy,"Oh, (starts a sexy walk toward him) I'm gonna give you more than  that. (grabs her raincoat belt to untie it)"
Xander,"(backs away, gesturing with his hands) Buff, for the love of  God, don't open that raincoat."
Buffy,Come on! It's a party! Aren't you gonna open your present?  (undoes a button)
Xander,"(keeps backing toward the stairs nervously) It's not that I  don't want to. Sometimes the remote impossible possibility that you  might like me was all that sustained me. But not now. (trips and falls  backward onto the stairs) Not like this. This isn't real to you. (Buffy  steps up and puts her leg over him) You're only here because of a spell.  (gets a confused stare from her) I mean, if I thought you had one clue  what it would mean to me... (shakes his head) But you don't. So I can't."
Buffy,(starts to get upset) So you're saying this is all a game?
Xander,A game? I... No!
Buffy,"(angry) You make me feel this way, and then you reject me? What  am I, a toy?"
Xander,"Buffy, please calm down."
Buffy,I'll calm down when you explain yourself!
Amy,(appears behind them) Get away from him. (Buffy turns to her) He's  mine.
Buffy,"(steps toward Amy) Oh, I don't think so. (looks back at him)  Xander, tell her."
Xander,"What? I, uh..."
Amy,He doesn't have to say. (Buffy looks back at her) I know what his  heart wants.
Buffy,"Funny, I know what your face wants."
Buffy,"What is this, you're two-timing me?"
Amy,"Goddess Hecate, work thy will."
Xander,Uh-oh.
Amy,Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!
Xander,"Buffy! (stares in utter disbelief) Oh, my God!"
Giles,"What, what just happened?"
Xander,(indicates the raincoat) Buffy.
Giles,Where is she?
Giles,"Oh, my God!"
Amy,(steps over to Xander) Why is she here? (gestures at Jenny)
Xander,Can you focus for a minute? You just turned Buffy into a rat.
Amy,(to Xander) Buffy can take care of herself. (takes his arm) Why  don't we go someplace private?
Xander,(jerks his arm away) Can you... I'm not going anywhere until  you change her back.
Jenny,(steps over to Amy) You heard him. So why don't you undo your  little magic trick and get lost?
Amy,"Who made you Queen of the World? Well, you're old enough to be."
Jenny,"Well, what can I say? (grabs Xander by the shirt) I guess  Xander's just too much man (pulls him closer) for the pimple squad."
Amy,"Goddess Hecate, to you I pray, with this..."
Xander,(puts his hand over Amy's mouth) Would you quit with the  Hecate?! (pulls her back and away)
Cordelia,"Okay, what now? You don't like my locker combination?"
Harmony,(hands on her hips) It's just not right. You never loved him.  You just used him. You make me sick.
Cordelia,"(sarcastically) Okay, Harmony, if you need to borrow my  Midol, just ask."
Giles,"You two, sit. (Amy goes to the table) And be quiet. (Jenny joins  her) We have to catch the Buffy rat. (takes off his coat)"
Xander,"(spots Buffy) Ooo, there!"
Xander,Good Buffy. Just...
Oz,(still shaking his hand) That kinda hurt.
Xander,(rubbing his cheek) Kinda?! What was that for?
Oz,"I was on the phone all night, listening to Willow cry about *you*.  Now, I don't know exactly what happened, but I was left with a very  strong urge to... hit you. (offers his hand to help Xander up)"
Xander,(takes Oz's hand and gets up) I didn't touch her. I swear.
Giles,(upset) Xander! Where's Buffy? (starts looking again)
Xander,(to Oz) Amy turned her into a rat.
Oz,(looks around) Oh.
Giles,"I don't see her. If anything happens to her, I'll... (looks at  Xander in disgust) Oh, just go home. (stands up) Lock yourself away.  You're only going to cause more problems here. Now, Amy, Jenny and I  will, uh... try and break the spell. (the women stand up) Oz, if, if you  could aid us in, in finding, um... Buffy."
Oz,Sure. Absolutely.
Giles,Just go. Get out of my sight.
Oz,Buffy...
Cordelia,What are you doing?! You guys are crazy!
Harmony,"You thought you could do better, is that it?"
Cordelia,"No, I..."
Cordette,We'll knock that snotty attitude right out of you!
Cordelia,Ow! Stop!
Giles,You must have botched the ritual so that Cordelia's necklace  actually protected her from the spell. Th-th-that one should be easily  reversible. W-w-where did you learn animal transformation?
Amy,(looks up at Giles) Why did you send Xander away? (Giles puts his  hands to his eyes in despair) He needs me.
Jenny,(chortles) That's a laugh.
Amy,(to Jenny) He loves me. We look into each other's souls.
Jenny,No one can love two people at once. What *we* have is real.
Giles,"Instead of making me ill, why doesn't one of you try to help me?"
Amy,(looks back into her pocket mirror) You have no idea what I'm  going through.
Giles,"(gets up) (to Amy, sternly) I know it's not love. It's  obsession. Selfish, banal obsession. (Jenny starts out of the library)  Now, Xander has put himself in very great danger. If you cared at all  about him, you'd help me save him, rather than wittering on about your  feelings."
Giles,"Now, let's get on with some work. (turns to Jenny) Now, Jenny...  (sees she's gone) Great!"
Xander,I think we... (sees a crowd of girls waiting for them) lost  'em.
Willow,I should've known I'd find you with her.
Xander,"Will... Come on, you don't wanna hurt me."
Willow,"Oh, no? You don't know how hard this is for me. I love you so  much! I'd rather see you dead than with that bitch."
Harmony,Get away from him! He's mine!
Xander,"Okay, now I really think we've lost them."
Cordelia,"Damn it, Xander, what's going on? Who died and made *you*  Elvis?"
Xander,(sees the house) Buffy's house. Let's get inside. I'll explain  later.
Cordelia,(frantic) Come on!
Joyce,"(opens the door) Xander, Cordelia, what..."
Cordelia,"Yeah, hi."
Joyce,What happened? Why are you all scratched up? Where's Buffy?
Xander,"She's, um... around."
Joyce,"(gestures to a stool) Well, sit down and tell me about it.  (Xander sits) (to Cordelia) Why don't you run upstairs and grab some  bandages out of the bathroom?"
Joyce,"Let me, uh, get you something to drink. You in the mood for cold  or hot?"
Xander,"I, uh... (shrugs with his hands)"
Joyce,"(walks around behind him) I think it's (starts rubbing his  shoulders) more of a *hot* night, don't you? (leans in and giggles)"
Xander,(drops his head to the table) Whatever.
Joyce,"(massages his shoulders) Ooo, you are so tense. (kisses his  neck) Mm."
Cordelia,(comes back) What are you doing? Make me yak!
Joyce,"(defensive) Cordelia, go back upstairs. This is between us."
Cordelia,Gross! I think not.
Joyce,What are you doing? Hey! Get your hands off me!
Cordelia,And keep your mom-aged mitts off my boyfriend. Former! (to  Xander) Why has everyone gone insane?
Xander,Insane? Is it so impossible for you to believe that other women  find me attractive?
Cordelia,The only way you could get girls to want you would be  witchcraft.
Xander,"That is such a... (concedes) Well, yeah, okay, good point."
Cordelia,"Oh, my God!"
Joyce,"Xander, honey, let Joycie in. Hon, let Joycie in!"
Xander,Upstairs! Buffy's room!
Joyce,(finds and works the lock) Sweetheart...
Xander,Good. The mob still hasn't found us. We should be safer up  here.
Angelus,Works in theory.
Cordelia,(terrified) Xander!
Angelus,Where's Buffy?!
Xander,"Cordy, get outta here!"
Angelus,"Perfect. (grabs Xander and pulls him up) I wanted to do  something special for Buffy, actually to Buffy, but this is *so* much  better!"
Angelus,"If it's any consolation, I feel very close to you right now."
Xander,"Buffy, how..."
Drusilla,"Don't fret, kitten. (helps him up) Mummy's here."
Angelus,"I don't know what you're up to, Dru, but it *doesn't* amuse!"
Drusilla,If you harm one hair on this boy's head... (strokes his hair)
Angelus,You've gotta be kidding. Him?
Drusilla,Just because I finally found a *real* man... (turns Xander to  face her)
Angelus,I guess I really *did* drive you crazy. (backs away)
Drusilla,(runs her fingers over Xander's lips) Your face is a poem.  (moans) I can read it.
Xander,(terrified) Really? It doesn't say 'spare me' by any chance?
Drusilla,Shhh. (kisses him) How do you feel about eternal life?
Xander,"(trembles with fear) We couldn't just start with a coffee? A  movie, maybe?"
Girl,There he is! Get them!
Jenny,He's mine! Get off!
Willow,All you had to do was love me!
Cordelia,No!
Cordelia,Get out of the way! Move it! Get off him!
Cordelia,Back off!
Girl,I love you!
Angelus,"Ahh! Sorry, Dru. (she turns to face him) I guess you're not  invited."
Joyce,"It's never gonna work for us, Xander. We have to end it."
Oz,"Here, Buffy."
Giles,Right. (to Amy) Go on. You first.
Xander,Gimme a nail!
Cordelia,If we die in here I'm gonna kick your ass! I mean it!
Xander,"(looks back at her) None of this would've happened if you  hadn't broken up with me. But no, you're so desperate to be popular!  (hammers)"
Cordelia,"Me? I'm not the one who embraced the black arts just to get  the girls to like me. Well, congratulations, it worked!"
Xander,"(looks at her) Would've worked fine, except your hide's so  thick, not even magic can penetrate it! (hammers)"
Cordelia,You mean the spell was for me?
Amy,"Goddess of creatures great and small, I conjure thee to withdraw."
Amy,"Hecate, I hereby license thee to depart."
Oz,Buffy?
Cordelia,"Oh, my God!"
Xander,Stay behind me.
Giles,"Um... Diana, goddess of love, be gone."
Giles,Hear no more thy siren's song.
Cordelia,Get off!
Cordelia,Get off me!
Girl,What's going on? Where am I? What's going on?
Buffy,"(smiles) Hi, Oz!"
Oz,Hi.
Buffy,I seem to be having a slight case of nudity here.
Oz,But you're not a rat. So call it an upside.
Buffy,You think maybe you could get me some clothing?
Oz,"Yes, I can. Just, uh... don't go anywhere. (leaves)"
Buffy,(looks around) Really not an issue.
Joyce,What... What did we...
Cordelia,"(thinking quick) Boy, that was the best scavenger hunt ever."
Buffy,Scavenger hunt.
Xander,Your mom seemed to buy it.
Buffy,So she says. I think she's just so wigged at hitting on one of  my friends that she's repressing. She's getting pretty good at that. I  should probably start worrying.
Xander,"Well, I'm back to being incredibly unpopular."
Buffy,"It's better than everyone trying to ax-murder you, right?"
Xander,"Mostly, but, uh... Willow won't even talk to me."
Buffy,Any particular reason she should?
Xander,How much groveling are we talking here?
Buffy,"Oh, a month, at least. (they stop and face each other) Xander,  come on, I mean... this is worse for her than anyone. She loved you  before you invoked the great Roofie spirit. The rest of us..."
Xander,"You remember, huh?"
Buffy,"Oh, yeah. I remember coming on to you, I remember begging you to  undress me... And then a sudden need for cheese. I also remember that  you didn't."
Xander,Need cheese?
Buffy,Undress me. It meant a lot to me what you said.
Xander,"C'mon, Buffy, I couldn't take advantage of you like that. Okay,  for a minute, it was touch and go there..."
Buffy,You came through. There might just be hope for you yet.
Xander,"Well, tell that to Cordelia."
Buffy,You're on your own there.
Harmony,Cody Weinberg called me at home last night.
Cordelia,Cody Weinberg? The one with the 350sl?
Harmony,The very one. Said he's thinking of asking me to the pledge  dance on Thursday.
Cordelia,That's so huge!
Harmony,"Yeah, there's just two other girls he's gonna ask first, and  if they refuse, then I'll..."
Harmony,Watch it!
Xander,Sorry.
Harmony,"God! (looks him up and down) Y'know, I'm glad your mom stopped  working at the drive-through long enough to dress you. (to Cordelia) Oh,  that reminds me. (Xander starts away) Did you see Jennifer's backpack?  It is *so* a crying..."
Cordelia,"(interrupts) Harmony, shut up. (Xander looks back) Do you  know what you are, Harmony? You're a sheep."
Harmony,I'm not a sheep.
Cordelia,"You're a sheep. All you ever do is what everyone else does  just so you can say you did it first. And here I am, scrambling for your  approval, when I'm *way* cooler than you are 'cause I'm *not* a sheep. I  do what I wanna do, and I wear what I wanna wear. And you know what?  (Xander smiles) I'll date whoever the hell I wanna date. No matter how  lame he is."
Cordelia,"(breathing hard with anxiety) Oh, God! Oh, God!"
Xander,(pats her hand) You're gonna be okay. Just keep walkin'.
Cordelia,"Oh, God, what have I done? They're never gonna speak to me  again!"
Xander,"Oh, sure, they are. If it helps, whenever we're around them you  and I can fight a lot."
Cordelia,You promise?
Xander,(takes her hand in his) You can pretty much count on it.
