character,dialogue
Xander,"(reads) 'Are you a people person, or do you prefer keeping your  own company?' Well, what if I'm a people person who keeps his own  company by default?"
Buffy,"So, mark 'none of the above'."
Xander,"Well, there are no boxes for 'none of the above'. That would  introduce too many variables into their mushroom head, number-crunching  little world."
Willow,(sits) I'm sensing bitterness.
Xander,"No, it's just these people can't tell from one multiple-choice  test what we're gonna be doing for the rest of our lives. It's  ridiculous!"
Willow,(smiles) I'm kinda curious to find out what sort of career I  could have.
Xander,"What, and suck all the spontaneity out of being young and  stupid? I'd rather live in the dark."
Willow,You're not gonna be young forever.
Xander,"Yes, but I'll always be stupid. (smirks and looks at the girls)  Okay, let's not all rush to disagree."
Buffy,(looks up at him seriously) You're not stupid.
Cordelia,"'I aspire to help my fellow man.' (marks her test) Check. As  long as he's not smelly, dirty or something gross. (walks by the table)"
Xander,"Cordelia Chase, always ready to give a helping hand to the rich  and the pretty."
Cordelia,"Which, lucky me, excludes you. Twice."
Xander,Is murder always a crime?
Buffy,Do I like shrubs?
Xander,That's between you and your god.
Buffy,(to Willow) What'd you put?
Willow,I came down on the side of shrubs.
Buffy,"Go with shrubs! Okay! (frustrated) Uhhh! I shouldn't even be  bothering with this. It's all mootville for me. No matter what my  aptitude test says, we already know my deal."
Xander,"Yup, high risk, sub-minimum wage..."
Buffy,Pointy wooden things...
Willow,Then why are you even taking the test?
Buffy,"It's Principal Snyder's hoop of the week. He's not happy unless  I'm jumping. Believe me, I would *not* be here otherwise."
Willow,"You're not even a teensy weensy bit curious about what kinda  career you could've had? I mean, if you weren't already the Slayer and  all."
Buffy,"Do the words 'sealed in fate' ring any bells for you, Will? Why  go there?"
Xander,"Y'know, with that kind of attitude you could've had a bright  future as an employee at the DMV. (shakes his pencil at her)"
Buffy,"I'm sorry, it's just... unless Hell freezes over and every vamp  in Sunnydale puts in for early retirement, I'd say my future is pretty  much a non-issue."
Spike,Read it again.
Dalton,"Well, I'm not sure. It could be, uh... (shrugs with his hands)  deprimere... ille... bubula... linter."
Spike,"(paging through a dictionary) Debase, the beef, canoe."
Spike,Why does that strike me as not right?
Drusilla,"Spike, come dance? (holds out her hand)"
Spike,"(angry) Give us some peace, would you? Can't you see I'm  working?"
Spike,"Oh, I'm sorry, kitten. (goes to her) It's just this manuscript.  Supposed to hold your cure, but it reads like gibberish. E-even Dalton  here, the big brain, he can't make heads or tails of it."
Drusilla,"I... I, I need to change Miss Edith."
Spike,"Oh, forgive me! You know I can't stand to see you like this.  (sits her down and crouches) We're runnin' out of time. It's that bloody  Slayer! Whenever I turn around she's muckin' up the works."
Drusilla,(tries to comfort him back) Shh. Shh. You'll make it right. I  know.
Spike,"Well. (walks around the table) Come on, now. Enlighten me."
Dalton,"Uh, well, it looks like Latin, but it's not. I-I'm not even  sure it's, it's a language, actually, I..."
Spike,Then MAKE IT A LANGUAGE! Isn't that what a transcriber does?!
Dalton,"Well, not exactly..."
Spike,I want the cure.
Drusilla,Don't...
Spike,Why not? Some people find pain (punches Dalton in the stomach)  very inspirational.
Drusilla,(looks up from her cards) He can't help you. (looks back at  her cards) Not without... (points at a card) the key.
Spike,The key? You mean this book is in some kind of code?
Drusilla,Yeah.
Spike,Is that where we'll find this key?
Drusilla,Yeah!
Spike,"I'll send the boys, pronto!"
Drusilla,Now will you dance? (smiles)
Spike,"(smiles and takes her hand) I'll dance with *you*, pet."
Spike,On the Slayer's grave!
Buffy,"Does 'rest in peace' have no sanctity to you people? Oh, I  forgot. You're not a people."
Buffy,"One down, (turns and sees Dalton missing) one gone."
Angel,Buffy! You scared me.
Buffy,"(climbs in) Now you know what it feels like, Stealth Guy."
Buffy,Just dropping by for some quality time with Mr. Gordo?
Angel,(confused) Excuse me?
Buffy,The pig. (opens her trunk and dumps the bag in)
Angel,"Oh. (chuckles) I, uh..."
Buffy,What's up? (walks to her desk)
Angel,Nothing.
Buffy,"Only you don't have a nothing face. You have a something face.  And you don't have to whisper. Mom's in L.A. till Thursday. Art buying,  or something."
Angel,Then why'd you come in through the window?
Buffy,(crinkles her nose) Habit.
Angel,I wanted to make sure you're okay. I had a bad feeling.
Buffy,(exhales) There's a surprise. Angel comes with bad news.
Buffy,"Oh, God, I'm sorry. (walks over to him) Look, I've been Cranky  Miss all day. It's not you."
Angel,"Well, what is it then?"
Buffy,It's nothing.
Buffy,"(exhales) Uh, we're having this thing at school."
Angel,Career week?
Buffy,How did you know?
Angel,I lurk.
Buffy,"Right. Well, then you know it's a whole week of 'what's my  line', only... I don't get to play. (sits on her bed) Sometimes I just  want..."
Angel,You want what? (sits next to her)
Angel,It's okay.
Buffy,(looks up at Angel) The Cliff Notes version? I want a normal  life. Like I had before.
Angel,Before me.
Buffy,"No, Angel, (touches his hand) it's not you. (touches his cheek)  You're the one freaky thing in my freaky world that still makes sense to  me. (lowers her hand) I just get messed sometimes. (Angel looks down) I  wish we could be regular kids."
Angel,(looks back up) Yeah. I'll never be a kid. (gets up)
Buffy,"Okay, then a regular kid and her cradle robbing, creature-of- the-night boyfriend."
Angel,Was this part of your normal life?
Buffy,"Oh, my God. (laughs and stands up) My Dorothy Hamill phase. My  room in L.A. was pretty much a shrine. Dorothy dolls, Dorothy posters, I  even got the Dorothy haircut. Thereby securing a place for myself in the  geek hall of fame."
Angel,"Hmm, you wanted to be like her?"
Buffy,"I wanted to *be* her. My parents were fighting all the time, and  skating was an escape. I felt safe."
Angel,When was the last time you put on your skates?
Buffy,(inhales) About a couple of hundred demons ago.
Angel,"(steps close to her) There's a rink out past Route 17, it's...  closed on Tuesdays."
Buffy,(looks up at him) Tomorrow's Tuesday.
Angel,I know.
Cordelia,"Oh, here I am. 'Personal shopper or motivational speaker.'  Neato!"
Xander,Motivational speaker? On what? Ten ways to a more annoying you?
Cordelia,"Oh, what about you? You're... (giggles and leaves)"
Xander,What? (frantically looks himself up) What?!
Willow,You and Angel are going skating? Alone?
Buffy,Unless some unforeseen evil pops up. But I'm in full 'see no  evil' mode.
Willow,Angel ice-skating.
Buffy,I know. Two worlds collide.
Xander,Wouldn't you two say you know me about as well as anyone else?  Maybe even better than I know myself?
Willow,What's *this* about?
Xander,"When you look at me, do you think 'prison guard'?"
Buffy,"Um, crossing guard, maybe, but prison guard? (shakes her head)"
Xander,"They just put up the assignments for the career fair, and  according to my test results I can look forward to being gainfully  employed in the growing field of corrections."
Buffy,"(giggles) Well, at least you'll be on the right side of the  bars."
Xander,"Ha, ha, ha, ha! Laugh now, missy, they assigned you to the  booth for law enforcement professionals."
Buffy,(stunned) As in police?
Xander,"As in polyester, doughnuts and brutality."
Willow,"But, (smiles) doughnuts!"
Buffy,"(whines louder) Well, I'll just jump off that bridge when I come  to it."
Buffy,First I have to deal with Giles. He's on this Tony Robbins  hyper-efficiency kick. Expects me to check in every day after homeroom.  (walks off after Giles) Police?
Willow,"You didn't check to see which seminar I was assigned to, did  you?"
Xander,"I did, and you weren't."
Willow,I wasn't what?
Xander,On the list.
Willow,But I handed in my test! I used a number two pencil!
Xander,Then I guess you musta passed.
Willow,It's not the kinda test you pass or fail.
Xander,"Your name wasn't up there, Will."
Giles,AH!
Giles,"(exhales) Buffy. Thank you. (she sits) I've been, uh, indexing  the Watcher diaries covering the last couple of centuries. You would be  amazed at how numbingly pompous and long-winded some of these Watchers  were."
Buffy,Color *me* stunned.
Giles,"So, uh, I trust last night's patrol was fruitful?"
Buffy,"Semi. Mm, I caught one out of two vamps after they stole  something from this jumbo mausoleum."
Giles,They were stealing?
Buffy,"Yeah! They had tools, flashlights, whole nine yards. What does  that mean anyway? 'Whole nine yards'? (Giles begins to pace) Nine yards  of what? (whines) Now it's gonna bug me all day. Giles, you're in pace  mode. What gives?"
Giles,"Um, this vampire who escaped, did you see what he took?"
Buffy,"No, but I could take a guess and say it was something old."
Giles,You made no effort to find out what was taken?
Buffy,"Have a cow, Giles! I just figured it was your everyday vamp  hijinks."
Giles,"Well, what if it wasn't? This could be very serious! I mean, i- i-if you'd made an effort to, uh, to be more thorough in your  observations..."
Buffy,"Y'know, if you don't like the way I'm doing my job, why don't  you find somebody else? Oh, that's right, there can only be one. As long  as I'm alive, there is no one else. Well, there you go! I don't have to  be the Slayer. I could be dead."
Giles,That wasn't terribly funny. You notice I don't laugh.
Buffy,"Wouldn't be much of a change. Either way I'm bored, constricted,  I never get to shop, and my hair and fingernails still continue to grow.  So really, when you think about it, what's the diff?"
Giles,Do we have to be introspective now? Our only concern is to  discover what was stolen from that mausoleum last night.
Spike,This is it then?
Drusilla,(senses) It hums. I can hear it.
Spike,"Once you're well again, we'll have a coronation down Main  Street, and invite everyone, and drink for seven days and seven nights."
Dalton,(behind them) What about the Slayer? She almost blew the whole  thing for us. She's trouble.
Spike,(looks at him) You *don't* say? (gets up) Trouble?! (paces)  She's the gnat in my ear! The gristle in my teeth! She's the bloody  thorn in my BLOODY SIDE! (kicks the table violently)
Drusilla,(concerned) Spike?
Spike,We gotta do something. We'll never complete your cure with that  *bitch* breathing down our necks. (exhales) I need to bring in the big  guns. They'll take care of her once and for all.
Dalton,Big guns?
Spike,The Order of Taraka.
Dalton,The bounty hunters?!
Drusilla,They're coming to my party. (looks up) Three of them.
Dalton,"Uh, yes, but... The Order of Taraka, I mean... isn't that  overkill?"
Spike,"No, I think it's just enough kill."
Xander,"Willow! (they walk) What are you doing here? Fly! Be free,  little bird, you defy category!"
Willow,I'm looking for Buffy.
Xander,"Oh, she went with Giles about an hour ago. Some kind of field  trip deal."
Willow,"If she doesn't get back soon, Snyder's really... (spots him on  the stairs) ...done a great job with the fair this year, hasn't he,  Xander?"
Xander,"Principal Snyder! Great career fair, sir! Really! In fact, I'm  so inspired by your leadership, I'm thinking principal school. I wanna  walk in *your* shoes. Not your actual shoes, of course, because you're a  tiny person. Not tiny in the small sense, of course. Okay, I'm done now."
Snyder,Where is she?
Willow,Who?
Snyder,You know who.
Willow,You mean Buffy? (looks around) I just saw her...
Snyder,"(interrupts) And don't feed me that 'I just saw her a minute  ago, she's around here somewhere' story."
Willow,"But I did... just see her a minute ago, and she is... *around*  here somewhere!"
Xander,For what it's worth...
Snyder,"(interrupts) It's worth nothing, Harris. Whatever comes out of  your mouth is a meaningless waste of breath. An airborne toxic event."
Xander,"Well, I'm glad you feel comfortable enough to be so honest with  me. And I can only hope that one day I'm in the position to be that  honest with you."
Snyder,Fascinating. (leaves)
Xander,"(to Willow) Well, love to stay and chat, but I got an  appointment with the warden on standard riot procedure. Ciao. (walks  off)"
Willow,"Okay, see ya."
Recruiter,"Willow Rosenberg? (she faces them) Come with us, please?"
Willow,Excuse me?
Recruiter,Let's walk.
Recruiter,Try the canape'. It's excellent.
Willow,What is all this?
Recruiter,"You've been selected to meet with Mr. McCarthy, head  recruiter for the world's leading software concern. The jet was delayed  by fog at Sea-Tac, but he should be here any minute. Please, (indicates  the couch) make yourself comfortable."
Willow,But I didn't even get my test back.
Recruiter,The test was irrelevant. We've been tracking you for some  time.
Willow,Is that a good thing?
Recruiter,"I would think so. We're extremely selective. In fact, only  one other Sunnydale student met our criteria."
Oz,Canape'?
Giles,Buffy! Slow down! Please!
Buffy,"Giles, we have work to do, remember? Get with the program."
Giles,You're behaving remarkably im-immaturely. (pant)
Buffy,You know why? I *am* immature. I'm a teen. I have yet to mature.
Giles,I was (pant) simply offering some (pant) constructive criticism.  (pant)
Buffy,"No! You were harsh! God, you act like I picked this gig. But  remember, I'm the picked."
Giles,"What you have (pant) is more than (pant) a gig. (pant) It's a  sacred duty. (pant) Which (pant) shouldn't prevent you from e-e- eventually procuring some (pant) more (pant) gainful f-f-form of  employment. Uh-uh-uh, such as I did."
Buffy,"Uh, Giles, it's one thing to be a Watcher and a librarian. They  go together like chicken and... another chicken, or... two chickens,  or... something, you know what I'm saying! The point is, no one blinks  an eye if you want to spend all your days with books. What am I supposed  to do? Carve stakes for a nursery?"
Giles,"Um, point taken. I must, however, admit, I-I've never really...  Well, now there's a thought, have you ever considered law enforcement?"
Giles,What? (turns to look) Oh!
Giles,May I? (reaches for the flashlight)
Buffy,(hands it to him) Be my guest.
Giles,It's a reliquary. Used to house items of religious significance.  Most commonly a finger or some other body part from a saint.
Buffy,Note to self: religion: freaky.
Giles,"Du Lac. Oh dear, oh dear."
Buffy,I hate when you say that.
Giles,Josephus du Lac was buried here. He belonged to a religious sect  that was excommunicated by the Vatican at the turn of the century.
Buffy,Excommunicated *and* sent to Sunnydale. There's a guy big with  the sinning.
Giles,You remember the book that was stolen from the library by a  vampire a few weeks ago?
Buffy,Yeah.
Giles,It was written by Du Lac. Damn it! I let it slip my mind with  all the excitement.
Buffy,I'm guessing it wasn't a 'Taste of the Vatican' cookbook.
Giles,"No, the, uh, book was said to contain rituals and spells that  reap unspeakable evil. However, it was written in archaic Latin so that  nobody but the sect members could understand it."
Buffy,"So, everything's cool then."
Giles,"It's not. First the book was taken from the library, and now the  vampires have stolen something from Du Lac's tomb."
Buffy,You think they figured out how to read the book?
Giles,"Something's coming, Buffy, and whatever it is, I can guarantee  it's not good."
Announcement,"Bus 219, continuing service to Los Angeles, now arriving  in Sunnydale at the west gate."
Norman,Mrs. Kalish?
Norman,"Hello, I'm Norman Pfister with (holds up the case) Blush  Beautiful Skin Care. I'm not selling anything, so I'm not asking you to  buy, just to accept a few free samples."
Norman,Absolutely.
Handler,What the hell?
Handler,"Hey, you're not supposed to be in here!"
Handler,"Hey, c'mon!"
Willow,So Giles is sure that the vampire who stole his book is  connected to the one you slayed last night? Or is it slew?
Giles,"(comes out of the stacks with a National Geographic magazine)  Both are correct, and, yes, I'm sure. Du Lac was both a, a... a  theologian and a mathematician. (comes down the stairs) This article  describes an invention of his, which he called 'The Du Lac Cross'."
Xander,"So, why go to all the trouble of inventing something, and then  giving it a weak name like that? I mean, I'da gone with 'The Cross-o- matic', or, uh, 'The Amazing Mr. Cross'."
Giles,"The cross was more than a mere symbol, (hands the open magazine  to Willow) it was used to understand certain mystical texts, to, uh,  decipher hidden meanings and so forth."
Buffy,So you're saying these vampires went to all this hassle for your  basic decoder ring?
Giles,"(taken aback by the metaphor) Uh, actually, yes, I, I suppose I  am."
Willow,"According to this, Du Lac destroyed every cross except the one  buried with him."
Buffy,Why destroy your own work?
Giles,(paces) Perhaps he feared what might happen if it fell into the  wrong hands.
Xander,A fear we'll soon get to experience for ourselves up close and  personal.
Giles,U-unless we can preempt their plans.
Willow,How?
Giles,"Uh, by learning what's in the book before they do. Which means  we can expect to be here later tonight. (sits)"
Willow,(smiles broadly) Goody! Research party!
Xander,"Will, you need a life in the worst way."
Buffy,"(gets up) Speaking of, I really have to bail, but I promise I'll  be back bright and early tomorrow and ready to slay."
Giles,"This is a matter of some urgency, Buffy."
Buffy,"I realize that. Well, you have to admit, I kinda lack in the  book area. I mean, you guys are the brains, I'd only be here for moral  support anyway."
Xander,"That's untrue, Buffy, you totally contribute. You go for  snacks!"
Willow,"She *should* go. Y-y'know, gather her strength."
Giles,Perhaps you're right. There may be fierce battles ahead.
Xander,But Ho-Hos are a vital part of my cognitive process!
Buffy,"(smiles back at him) Sorry, Xand. Someplace I have to be."
Angel,Buffy!
Drusilla,He's passing under our feet right now.
Spike,No worries. We're close to decoding the manuscript. We just need  a bit more time.
Drusilla,Time is ours. It brings the Slayer closer to them.
Buffy,The Hellmouth presents: Dead Guys On Ice. Not exactly the  evening we were aiming for.
Angel,You're in danger. You know what the ring means?
Buffy,I just killed a Super Bowl champ?
Angel,(annoyed) I'm serious! You should go home and wait until you  hear from me.
Angel,Are you okay?
Buffy,What about you? That cut! (lowers her hand)
Angel,"Forget about me. This is bad, Buffy. We gotta get you outta  here."
Buffy,"What, you mean hide?"
Angel,Let's just get you someplace safe!
Buffy,No! Your eye!
Buffy,Hey! Don't be a baby. I'm not gonna hurt you.
Angel,It's not that. I...
Buffy,What?
Angel,You shouldn't have to touch me when I'm like this.
Buffy,Oh.
Buffy,I didn't even notice.
Buffy,"This guy was hard-core, Giles. And Angel was power-freaked by  that ring."
Giles,I'm afraid he was not overreacting. This ring is worn only by  members of the Order of Taraka. It's a society of deadly assassins  dating back to King Solomon. (sits)
Xander,And didn't they beat the Elks this year in the Sunnydale adult  bowling league championships?
Giles,Their credo is to sow discord and kill the unwary.
Xander,Bowling is a vicious game.
Giles,"(very annoyed) That's enough, Xander!"
Giles,Sorry. It's just not the time for jokes. I need to think. (takes  off his glasses)
Buffy,"These assassins, why are they after me?"
Willow,'Cause you're the scourge of the underworld?
Buffy,I haven't been that scourgey lately.
Giles,"(rubbing his eyes) I don't know, I don't know. (exhales) I think  the best thing we can do is to find a secure location. Somewhere out of  the way you can go until we decide on the best course of action."
Buffy,"(gets up) Okay, now you and Angel have both said to head for the  hills. Are you saying I can't handle this, that I'm not strong enough to  fight these people?"
Giles,"They're a breed apart, Buffy. U-unlike vampires they have no  earthly desires, (Willow listens in shock) but to collect their bounty.  They find a target, and, uh... they eliminate it. (Buffy absorbs this  solemnly) You can kill as many of them as you like, it won't make any  difference. Where there's one, there will be another, and another. They  won't stop coming until the job is done."
Giles,Each one of them works alone.
Giles,His own way.
Giles,"Some are human, some... a-are not. Y-you won't know who they are  until they strike."
Buffy,Try it!
Oz,(confused) Try what?
Buffy,Uh... (exhales) I-I'm sorry.
Oz,Still not clear what I'm supposed to try.
Buffy,"Nothing. God, I'm... sorry, I..."
Oz,That is a tense person.
Willow,I wish there was more we could do.
Giles,We're doing all that we can. (puts on his glasses) The only  course of action is to try and find out what was in that stolen book.  (reads a card from the catalog)
Willow,I've never seen Buffy like that. She just took off.
Xander,"(coming in) Well, she didn't go home. I let the phone ring a  few hundred times before I remembered her mom is out of town."
Giles,"Well, maybe Buffy unplugged the phone."
Xander,"No, it's a statistical impossibility for a sixteen-year-old  girl to unplug her phone."
Giles,"Well, perhaps my words of caution were... a little too alarming."
Xander,(with heavy sarcasm) Ya think?
Willow,"It's good that she took you seriously, Giles. I just wish we  knew where she was."
Buffy,Angel?
Willy,We're closed! Can't you read the sign?
Willy,"Oh, uh... hey, Angel. I didn't recognize you in the dark there.  What, uh... what can I do for you tonight?"
Angel,I need some information.
Willy,"Yeah? Man, that's too bad, 'cause... I'm stayin' away from that  whole scene. I'm livin' right, Angel."
Angel,"Sure you are, Willy. And I'm taking up sunbathing."
Willy,"C'mon, man. Don't be that way! I-I treat you vamps good! I-I-I-I  don't hassle you, you don't hassle me... We all enjoy the patronage of  this establishment. Everybody's happy, right?"
Angel,Who sent them?
Willy,Who sent who?
Angel,(stops at the pinball machine) The Order of Taraka.
Willy,"I-I... I tell ya, I haven't been in the loop."
Angel,"Let's try again. The Order of Taraka, they're after the Slayer.  (crosses over to the bar)"
Willy,"C'mon, man."
Angel,Was it Spike? (steps toward Willy)
Willy,"Look, Angel, I-I got some good pigs' blood in, good stuff, my  fence said..."
Willy,Damn it! Ah...
Angel,"You know, I'm a little rusty when it comes to killing humans. It  could take a while."
Willy,"Oh, Spike will draw and quarter me, man!"
Angel,I'll take care of Spike.
Willy,You know he ordered those guys! Spike's sick of your girl  getting in his way!
Angel,Where can I find him?
Willy,"I tell you that, I'm gonna need relocating expenses! It'll cost  you!"
Angel,(presses harder) It'll cost who?
Willy,Okay! Okay! He and that freaky chick of his are...
Angel,Who are you? If you tell me what I need to know I won't hurt  you.
Angel,You think this is funny?
Kendra,I tink it is funny now. Dat girl. De one I saw you wit before?
Angel,You stay away from her.
Kendra,I'm afraid you are not in a position to treaten.
Angel,When I get outta here I'll do more than threaten!
Kendra,Den I suggest ya move quickly. (looks up at the windows)  Eastern exposure. De sun will be comin' in a few hours. (padlocks the  cage) More dan enough time for me to find your girlfriend.
Giles,"Xander? (pauses) No, no, I-I haven't heard from Buffy yet. Look,  look, I-I-I think you should go to her house and check on her. (pauses)  Well, ri-right a, right away. (pauses) I-I-I don't know, get Cordelia to  drive you."
Giles,(quietly) Willow?
Willow,Don't warn the tadpoles!
Giles,Are you alright?
Willow,"Giles, what are you doing here?"
Giles,"It's the library, Willow. You fell asleep."
Willow,(looks around) Oh! I...
Giles,Don't warn the tadpoles?
Willow,(groggy) I... I have frog fear.
Giles,Oh.
Willow,I'm sorry. I conked out.
Giles,"What? Please. You've gone quite beyond the call of duty. (sits)  But, but, I-I... uh, fortunately, I think I may have found something  finally."
Willow,You did?
Giles,"I-I found a-a description of the missing Du Lac manuscript. It's  a ritual, Willow. Now, I-I, uh... (gets up to pace) I haven't managed to  decipher the exact details, but I-I... I believe the purpose is to  restore a weak and sick vampire back to full health."
Willow,A vampire like Drusilla?
Giles,Exactly.
Spike,"By George, I think he's got it! (walks to Drusilla in bed) The  key to your cure, ducks. The missing bloody link, it was..."
Drusilla,"(weakly) ...Right, right in front of us... the whole time."
Cordelia,"I can't even believe you. You dragged me out of bed for a  ride? What am I, mass transportation?"
Xander,"That's what a lot of the guys say, but it's just locker room  talk. I wouldn't pay it any mind."
Cordelia,"Oh, great, so now I'm your taxi *and* your punching bag."
Xander,"I like to think of you more as my witless foil, but have it  your way."
Xander,Buffy!
Xander,"C'mon, Cordelia. You wanna be a member of the Scooby Gang you  gotta be willing to be inconvenienced every now and then. (tries a  window)"
Cordelia,"Oh, right, 'cause I lie awake at night hoping you tweakos  will be my best friends."
Cordelia,"And that my first husband will be a balding, demented  homeless man."
Xander,(gets the window open) Buffy could be in trouble. (steps  through the window)
Cordelia,"And what if she is exactly? What are you gonna do about it?  In case you haven't noticed, (he opens the door for her) you're the  lameness and she's the super chick, or whatever."
Xander,"Well, at least I'm the lameness who cares, which is more than I  can say about you. (into the house) Buffy! I'm gonna check upstairs."
Xander,Buffy?
Norman,Good day. I'm Norman Pfister with Blush Beautiful (holds up his  case) Skin Care and Cosmetics. I was wondering if I might interest you  in some free samples?
Cordelia,(smiles) Free?
Buffy,You must be number two!
Buffy,"Thanks for the wakeup, but I'll stick with my clock radio."
Buffy,"Come on, don't make me do the chick fight thing."
Kendra,Chick fight?
