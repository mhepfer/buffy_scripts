GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
GILES,You are the Slayer. Into each generation a Slayer is born.
BUFFY,"Why don't we start with 'Hi, I'm Buffy.'"
XANDER,Xander.
CORDELIA,Cordelia.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,"Willow, right?"
GILES,Mister Giles.
ANGEL,Angel.
A quick series of scenes from the first season,"the Master with the Anointed One; Buffy and Angel kissing; Angel vamping out, Buffy screaming; the possessed ventriloquist dummy; Buffy punching someone; Buffy dying; Buffy killing the Master, etc..."
"Moves into a series of scenes from the second season. They go by faster and faster. I can't possibly detail every one, but they include all the major demons and recurring characters","Spike, Ethan, Drusilla, Kendra, Ted, etc. We see Xander kissing Cordelia, Willow kissing Oz, Angel killing Jenny Calendar, Willow in the hospital doing the spell to restore Angel's soul, Buffy killing Angel."
VAMP,Gave me a pretty good run there. Bet the blood's just pumpin'.
VAMP,(advancing) Bet it's hot.
KID,(voice breaking) Don't hurt me.
VAMP,Don't hurt you? (laughs)
BUFFY,"(innocently) Hey, what's going on?"
KID,Help me! Call the police!
VAMP,"Get outta here, girl. (turns back to the kid)"
BUFFY,"(emerging from the doorway) You guys havin' a fight? 'Cause, you know, fighting's not cool."
KID,Get out of here!
VAMP,"No. (turns fully toward Buffy) No, she wants to stay. I don't mind a little appetizer."
BUFFY,"(small frown, walks forward) Have you ever heard the expression, 'biting off more than you can chew'?"
BUFFY,"Okay. Um ... how about the expression, 'vampire slayer'?"
VAMP,What the hell you talkin' about?
BUFFY,"Wow. Never heard that one. Okay. How about, 'Oh god, my leg, my leg'?"
VAMP,Oh god! My leg! Uhh...
BUFFY,See? Now we're communicating.
BUFFY,Wow. Been a long while since I met one who didn't know me.
BUFFY,You should get home.
KID,H-how'd you do that?
BUFFY,It's what I do.
KID,But you're ... you're just a girl.
BUFFY,That's what *I* keep saying.
XANDER,Something goin' on out back?
BUFFY,(walks over to table) Vampire.
XANDER,Oh.
BUFFY,(sighs) Anything?
GILES,"Nothing you want to hear. The ritual is, uh..."
BUFFY,Explain it again.
GILES,There's nothing new to-
BUFFY,Go through it again.
GILES,"The key was ... living energy. It needed to be channeled, poured into a specific place at a specific time. The energy ... would flow into that spot, the walls between the dimensions break down. It stops, the energy's used up, the walls come back up. Glory uses that time to get back into her own dimension, not caring that all manner of hell will be unleashed on earth in the meantime."
ANYA,"Um, but only for a little while, right? The walls come back up, uh, n-no more hell?"
WILLOW,That's only if the energy is stopped. And now the key is human ... (looks over her shoulder at Buffy) ...is Dawn.
GILES,"(reads from book) ""The blood flows, the gates will open. The gates will close when it flows no more."" (removes his glasses) When Dawn is dead."
TARA,I have places to be!
XANDER,"Why blood? Why Dawn's blood? I mean, why couldn't it be like a, a lymph ritual?"
SPIKE,'Cause it's always got to be blood.
XANDER,We're not actually discussing dinner right now.
SPIKE,"Blood is life, lackbrain. Why do you think we eat it? It's what keeps you going. Makes you warm. Makes you hard. Makes you other than dead. (quietly) Course it's her blood."
BUFFY,"Pretty simple math here. We stop Glory before she can start the ritual. We still have a couple of hours, right?"
GILES,If my calculations are right. But Buffy-
BUFFY,I don't wanna hear it. (turns away)
GILES,I understand that-
BUFFY,"(whirls back) No! No, you don't understand. We are not talking about this."
GILES,"(jumps up from the table, yells) Yes, we bloody well are!"
GILES,(quieter) If Glory begins the ritual ... if we can't stop her...
BUFFY,Come on. Say it. We're bloody well talking about this. Tell me to kill my sister.
GILES,(whispers) She's not your sister.
BUFFY,"(pause) No. She's not. She's more than that. She's me. The monks made her out of me. I hold her ... and I feel closer to her than ... (looks down, sighs) It's not just the memories they built. It's physical. Dawn ... is a part of me. The only part that I- (stops)"
WILLOW,"We'll solve this. We will. Don't have another coma, okay?"
GILES,"(quietly) If the ritual starts, then every living creature in this and every other dimension imaginable will suffer unbearable torment and death ... (looks up at Buffy) including Dawn."
BUFFY,Then the last thing she'll see is me protecting her.
GILES,(quietly) You'll fail. You'll die. We all will. (turns away from the table)
BUFFY,I'm sorry.
BUFFY,I love you all ... but I'm sorry.
ANYA,"(loudly) Okay. (raises her hand) All in favor of stopping Glory *before* the ritual. Suggestions, ideas? (snapping her fingers) Time's a-wastin'."
SPIKE,Uh ... when you say you love us all...
XANDER/GILES,(unison) Shut up.
ANYA,"Willow. I bet you've got some dark spell a-brewin'. Uh, make her a, a, a toad? Little hoppy toad, we can hit her with a hammer?"
TARA,(giggling) Hoppy toad.
XANDER,"What about Ben? He can be killed, right? I mean, I know he's an innocent, but, you know, not like Dawn innocent. We could kill a ... regular guy."
XANDER,"(softly, in self-disgust) God."
GILES,It's doubtful he'll surface again this close to the ritual. We can expect it's Glory we're dealing with.
WILLOW,"We don't have to kill her. Uh, we just have to stop her from doing the ritual. I mean, there's only the one time that she can do it, right?"
SPIKE,"Yeah. We get her on the ropes, we just gotta keep her occupied till it's too late."
ANYA,Okay. But I'm still not hearing enough ideas. She's a god. Let's think outside the box.
SPIKE,Why don't *you* go think outside the bleeding box.
GILES,"Yes, Anya, apart from your incredibly uninfectious enthusiasm, have you anything else to contribu-"
ANYA,The Dagon sphere!
GILES,Sorry?
ANYA,"When Buffy first met Glory, she found that magical ... (gestures) glowy sphere that was meant to repel Glory. We've got it in the basement. (everyone looks surprised) It might drive her away or hurt her. Ooh!"
ANYA,And Olaf the troll god's enchanted hammer.
ANYA,"You wanna fight a god, use the weapon of a god."
SPIKE,"Uh, nah, that thing's too heavy to- (Buffy picks it up easily) Yeah. Good."
BUFFY,I like this. (to Anya) Thanks.
ANYA,Here to help. Wanna live.
XANDER,Smart chicks are soooo hot. (looking fondly at Anya)
WILLOW,You couldn't have figured that out in tenth grade?
GILES,"Well, we have some ideas, if we could actually get Glory on the run, but, um..."
BUFFY,"But, we still have no idea how to find her."
TARA,"Big day. Oh, it calls me! I have to be there!"
TARA,Big day!
Cut to,Ben entering the back room at the warehouse. He still wears the ceremonial robe and is holding a pile of clothing. A few minions are in the background.
BEN,"They, uh ... said you have to put this on ... for the ceremony."
DAWN,What if I don't?
BEN,"Come on, just-"
DAWN,What if I don't like the color?
BEN,"Look, I ... I wish there was another way."
DAWN,"And I wish you'd fall on your head and drown in your own barf, so ... (shrugs) I guess we're both disappointed."
BEN,I think ... it'll be quick.
MINION,"Actually, sir, the bleeding is quite a slow process to give the portal time to-"
BEN,(annoyed) Thank you ... for the information. (to Dawn) I'll do what I can to-
DAWN,Change.
BEN,What?
DAWN,Change. Be her. I don't wanna look at you.
BEN,"(shakes head) Dawn, I don't think you wanna-"
DAWN,Be Glory. Be Glory. (yelling) Glory! Glory! Glory!
BEN,Will you just stop- (morphs into Glory)
GLORY,-shouting already?
GLORY,Huh.
GLORY,"So, what's the hubbub, bub? (sits in a chair) What do you got against old Benjy?"
DAWN,He's a monster. At least you're up-front about it.
GLORY,"(picking at the hem of the dress) Don't be so hard on the boy. He just wants to live. Most guys would do the same. Besides, he's probably the reason your sis and her little cartoon pals are still alive. That little nagging pinch of humanity that makes me go for the hurt instead of the kill. (looks at Dawn) Lowering myself to trade blows with the Slayer when I should have just put my fist through her heart."
GLORY,It's gotta be Ben.
DAWN,Or maybe you just can't take her.
GLORY,"Hmm, funny thing. You've been here for a few hours now, and I haven't seen big sis galloping in to save you. She probably knows what a terrible mistake that'd be."
DAWN,She's not afraid of you.
GLORY,"Oh no, sweetie baby. I'm talking about the ritual. 'Cause you know I bleed you, the portals open, but once you die they close. The faster you die, the better for your sorry species."
GLORY,"I'm bettin' Buffy knows that. Since she's not really your sister, I'm guessin' she isn't gonna show. And if she does..."
GLORY,...it might not be to save you.
DAWN,(whispers) Buffy.
GILES,You sure you're not going to tire yourself out?
BUFFY,(stops punching) I'm sure.
GILES,"We're ... still working on ideas. (Buffy stops punching) Time's short, but, uh, best leave it to the last moment. (Buffy stretching her arms) If we go in too early and she takes us out, no chance of getting her to miss her window."
BUFFY,Then we wait.
GILES,I imagine you hate me right now.
GILES,I love Dawn.
BUFFY,I know.
GILES,"But I've sworn to protect this sorry world, and sometimes that means saying and doing ... what other people can't. What they shouldn't have to."
BUFFY,"You try and hurt her, and you know I'll stop you."
GILES,I know.
BUFFY,This is how many apocalypses for us now?
GILES,"Oh, uh, well... (sits, takes off his glasses) six, at least. (sits back slowly) Feels like a hundred."
BUFFY,I've always stopped them. Always won.
GILES,Yes.
BUFFY,I sacrificed Angel to save the world.
BUFFY,I loved him so much. But I knew ... what was right. I don't have that any more. I don't understand. I don't know how to live in this world if these are the choices. If everything just gets stripped away. I don't see the point. I just wish that... (tearfully) I just wish my mom was here.
BUFFY,The spirit guide told me ... that death is my gift. Guess that means a Slayer really is just a killer after all.
GILES,I think you're wrong about that.
BUFFY,"It doesn't matter. If Dawn dies, I'm done with it. I'm quitting."
GLORY,"Okay, campers, it's almost stab time. (smiling) You two, get her."
DAWN,No. No! Aah! (screams) Buffy!
GLORY,See you in a few.
GILES,(calling) Any luck? Have you found the Dagon sphere?
ANYA,"(calling) Um, I'm sure it's here, just be a minute!"
XANDER,"(calling) Yeah, we're on it! Let's look over here, where we didn't look yet."
GILES,(OS) Time is a factor.
ANYA,Yes. Yes. Not to worry.
XANDER,"So, are you more, uh ... relaxed?"
ANYA,(looking through boxes) No.
XANDER,"No? I mean, it sounded like you, uh ... (paces past her) arrived."
ANYA,"(distracted) No. (tunes back in to the conversation) Yes. Um, I had the pleasure moment, and the blissful calm that comes right after it. But that only lasted a couple of seconds, and now I'm terrified again."
XANDER,"Well, you don't have to be."
XANDER,Gah!
ANYA,What?
XANDER,Spike's sex-bot. Why didn't they just melt it down into scrap?
ANYA,Maybe Willow wanted it.
XANDER,"(turns to her) I don't think Willow feels that way about, about Buffy. I mean, I know she's gone through a lot of changes, but-"
ANYA,To study it.
XANDER,Right. Robotics. (embarrassed ) Science.
ANYA,Pervert.
XANDER,Other pervert.
ANYA,And don't frighten me like tha-aah!
ANYA,"God, who, who would put something like that there? Is this supposed to be some sort of sick joke?"
ANYA,"I mean, things aren't bad enough! (pause) This is an omen."
XANDER,"Hey, hey, shh. (rubs her shoulders)"
ANYA,"No, no, it's an omen. It's a higher power, trying to tell me through bunnies that we're all gonna die. Oh god."
XANDER,No it's not.
XANDER,It's okay.
ANYA,"No, you see, usually when there's an apocalypse, I skedaddle. But now I love you so much that instead I have inappropriately timed sex and try to think of ways to fight a god ... and worry terribly that something might happen to you. And also worry that something'll happen to me. And then I have guilt that I'm not more worried about everyone else, but I just don't have enough! I'm just on total overload, and I honestly don't think that I could be more nervous than I am right now."
XANDER,Care to wager on that?
XANDER,Anya ... you wanna marry me?
XANDER,"Can I take that as a ""maybe""?"
ANYA,You're proposing to me!
XANDER,Yes...
ANYA,"You're proposing to me 'cause we're gonna die! And you think it's romantic and sexy and, and you know you're not gonna have to go through with it 'cause the world's gonna end!"
XANDER,"I'm proposing to you, Anya, because it's not."
ANYA,You can't know that.
XANDER,"I believe it. I think we're gonna get through this. I think I'm gonna live a long ... and silly life, and I'm not interested in doing that without you around."
ANYA,(softly) Oh. Okay.
XANDER,(wide-eyed) Okay?
ANYA,"Yes. (small smile) I mean, yes."
ANYA,No.
XANDER,No?
ANYA,After. Give it to me when the world doesn't end.
BUFFY,"Will, what do you got for me?"
WILLOW,"Some ideas. (Buffy goes to sit on the stairs leading up to the loft) Well, notions. Or, theories based on wild speculation. Did I mention I'm not good under pressure?"
BUFFY,"I need you, Will. You're my big gun."
WILLOW,"(alarmed) I'm your - no, I-I was never a gun. Someone else should be the gun. I, I could be a, a cudgel. Or, or a pointy stick."
BUFFY,"You're the strongest person here. You know that, right?"
WILLOW,(frowns) Well ... no.
BUFFY,"Will, you're the only person that's ever hurt Glory. At all. You're my best shot at getting her on the ropes, so don't get a jelly belly on me now."
WILLOW,"Well ... I, I ... do sort of have this one idea. But, last few days, I've mostly been looking into ways to help Tara. I-I know that shouldn't be my priority...."
BUFFY,Of course it should.
WILLOW,"Well, I've been charting their essences. Mapping out. I think ... if I can get close enough, I may be able to reverse what Glory did. Like, take back what she took from Tara. It might weaken Glory, or ... make her less coherent. Or it might make all our heads explode."
GILES,(OS) Buffy.
WILLOW,I'll try to work it.
WILLOW,"Don't worry, love. It won't be long."
TARA,(angrily) Bitch! I'm supposed to work on the factors!
TARA,"I'm, I'm not ... I'm not...."
WILLOW,I'm gonna bring you back.
BUFFY,"No. No, no, that's good. That could be pivotal. (to Anya and Xander) Thank you guys."
GILES,"Well, um, you're gonna need some-"
BUFFY,Way ahead of you. We have time?
GILES,"Yes, if you hurry."
BUFFY,Okay. I'll grab some weapons too. (we see Spike appearing behind Giles)
XANDER,I'm looking for something in a broadsword.
SPIKE,"Don't be swingin' that thing near me. (Buffy takes the sphere from Giles, examines it)"
XANDER,"Hey, I happen to be-"
SPIKE,A glorified bricklayer?
XANDER,(looks around at the others) I'm also a swell bowler.
ANYA,Has his own shoes.
SPIKE,The gods themselves do tremble.
BUFFY,"Spike, shut your mouth, come with me."
BUFFY,"The weapons are in the chest by the TV, I'll grab the stuff upstairs."
SPIKE,"Uh, Buffy..."
SPIKE,"If you wanna just hand them over the threshold, I'll..."
BUFFY,"Come in, Spike."
SPIKE,Hmm. Presto. No barrier.
SPIKE,"Um, won't bother with the small stuff. Couple of good axes should hold off Glory's mates while you take on the lady herself. (opens the chest, begins taking stuff out)"
BUFFY,We're not all gonna make it. You know that.
SPIKE,Yeah.
SPIKE,Hey. Always knew I'd go down fightin'.
BUFFY,I'm counting on you ... to protect her.
SPIKE,Till the end of the world. Even if that happens to be tonight.
BUFFY,I'll be a minute.
SPIKE,Yeah.
SPIKE,I know you'll never love me.
SPIKE,I know that I'm a monster. But you treat me like a man. And that's...
SPIKE,"Get your stuff, I'll be here."
MINION,She will come to you soon.
BUFFY,We on schedule?
GILES,"Yes, it's time."
BUFFY,Will?
WILLOW,"Tara, baby? Is there somewhere you should be?"
TARA,They held me down.
WILLOW,"No one's holding you. It's the big day, right?"
WILLOW,Do you wanna go?
TARA,(points to Giles) You're a killer. (Giles and Spike look at her in surprise) This is all set down.
BUFFY,(quietly) Stay close but don't crowd her. We'll follow in a minute.
BUFFY,"Everybody knows their jobs. Remember, the ritual starts, we all die. And I'll kill anyone who comes near Dawn."
SPIKE,"Well, not exactly the St. Crispin's Day speech, was it?"
GILES,We few...
GILES,...we happy few.
SPIKE,We band of buggered.
Cut to,"exterior city street, night. Tara walks along the sidewalk, picking at the cast on her hand. The camera pulls out to reveal Willow walking a few paces behind, with the others following farther behind that."
XANDER,Shpadoinkle.
ANYA,What is that?
GILES,The portal must open up there.
BUFFY,"Will, you're up."
GILES,Need anything?
WILLOW,Could use a little courage.
WILLOW,The real kind.
WILLOW,But thanks.
GLORY,You. What are you doing here?
WILLOW,She's with me.
GLORY,What the frickin' hell did that bitch do to me?
MINION,(anxiously) You look fine. Truly.
GLORY,"(clutching her head) She made a little ... she made a hole. Uh, I need a brain to eat."
MINION,"Oh, take mine, oh groove-tastic one! (bows)"
GLORY,"I said a brain, you worthless dirt!"
GLORY,"Big day. I got places to be, big day. Need a brain."
GLORY,Suppose I could always use yours.
BUFFY,(OS) Okay then.
BUFFY,Come and get it.
BUFFY,(innocently) You don't seem very well.
GLORY,"Your little witch bitch ... gave me kind of a headache there. (removes her ceremonial robe, revealing the simple black dress underneath) But if you think this is gonna last more than eight seconds-"
BUFFY,"I noticed you're talking, whereas in your position, I would attack me."
MINION,"Oh, most sweaty-naughty-feelings-causing one, should we..."
GLORY,"Go guard the girl. This is a ... this is a, a..."
MINION,Diversionary tactic?
GLORY,Go guard!
BUFFY,"It's strange, you're not as blurry with speed as usual either."
GLORY,The witch...
BUFFY,It's not her.
BUFFY,Might be this.
BUFFY,"I heard it's supposed to repel you. So my guess is ... you probably shouldn't touch it, either."
GLORY,You're gonna wish you-
MINION 1,Stand fast! Kill anyone who dares approach! This will be our day of glory!
MINION 2,Well punned.
MINION 1,"Well, it just called out to me."
WILLOW,Tara!
WILLOW,Tara?
WILLOW,Tara?
TARA,W ... Willow?
WILLOW,(smiles hopefully) Tara?
TARA,(tearfully) Willow ... I got so lost.
WILLOW,(smiling) I found you.
WILLOW,I will always find you.
GLORY,You know what?
GLORY,I'm feeling a little better. And now? I'm a little bored.
BUFFY,"Oh, I'm sorry. Cause you're about-"
GLORY,"(staring) Hey, wow, the Slayer's a robot. (looks around) Did everybody else know the Slayer was a robot?"
BUFFY,Glory?
BUFFY,"You're not the brightest god in the heavens, are you?"
DAWN,Buffy! I'm up here!
DAWN,Buffy!
GLORY,Oh no you don't!
DAWN,(screams) Buffy! I'm up here!
DAWN,(looking down) Buffy!
GLORY,"You lost your hammer, sweet cheeks. What are you gonna hit me with now?"
BUFFY,Whatever's handy.
XANDER,The glorified bricklayer picks up a spare.
ANYA,Has anyone noticed we're going backwards?
SPIKE,It's crossed my mind.
GILES,"(panting) As long as ... Buffy can keep Glory down ... long enough, it doesn't matter. (looking up at the tower) There's only a few minutes left to start the ritual."
DAWN,"You. You can help me. Untie me. Please. Help me, she's coming."
DOC,"(walks forward) Well, it seems she's running a bit late, is the thing. And, uh, if her Splendidness (Dawn looks upset) can't be here in time to bleed you..."
DOC,(whispers) Hey! (winks) Kid. Wanna see a trick?
XANDER,How we doing?
ANYA,So far it's a tie.
GILES,"We haven't got up to Dawn, but then neither has anyone else."
SPIKE,(still gazing up) Someone's up there.
XANDER,"Okay, we gotta charge or something."
ANYA,We tried that.
WILLOW VOICEOVER,Spike. Can you hear me?
SPIKE,"(frowns) Yeah, loud and clear."
WILLOW VOICEOVER,Is there someone up there with Dawn?
SPIKE,"Yeah, can't tell who."
XANDER,Are you talking to us?
WILLOW VOICEOVER,Get up there. Go now.
SPIKE,"Yeah, but-"
WILLOW VOICEOVER,Go!
DOC,Well. What do you know? (Spike appears behind him) It's just about that time.
DAWN,Spike!
SPIKE,Doesn't a fella stay dead when you kill him?
DOC,Look who's talking.
SPIKE,"Come on, Doc. Let's you and me have a go."
DOC,I ... (tapping his knife against his hand) do have a prior appointment.
SPIKE,This won't take long.
DOC,"No, I-I don't imagine it will."
GLORY,You're just a mortal. You couldn't understand my pain.
BUFFY,Then I'll just have to settle for causing it.
GLORY,You can't kill me.
BUFFY,No ... (hefts the hammer) but my arm's not even tired yet.
SPIKE,"You don't come near the girl, Doc."
DOC,I don't smell a soul anywhere on you. Why do you even care?
SPIKE,I made a promise to a lady.
DOC,Oh?
DOC,Then I'll send the lady your regrets.
SPIKE,(whispers) No.
DAWN,(screams) Aah! No!
GLORY,Stop it.
BUFFY,You're a god.
BUFFY,Make it stop.
BEN,I'm sorry.
BUFFY,"Tell her it's over. She missed her shot. (Ben watches her, not moving) She goes. She ever, *ever* comes near me and mine again..."
BEN,We won't. I swear.
BEN,"I guess we're stuck with each other, huh baby?"
GILES,Can you move?
BEN,Need a ... a minute. She could've killed me.
GILES,"No she couldn't. Never. And sooner or later Glory will re-emerge, and ... make Buffy pay for that mercy. And the world with her. Buffy even knows that... (reaches into his pocket, takes out his glasses) and still she couldn't take a human life."
GILES,"She's a hero, you see. (Giles puts his glasses on) She's not like us."
BEN,Us?
DOC,Shallow cuts... (Dawn crying) shallow cuts...
DOC,Let the blood ... flow ...
DOC,...free.
BUFFY,(OS) Dawn.
DAWN,(gasping in pain) Buffy!
DOC,This should be interesting.
BUFFY,Here.
DAWN,"Buffy, it hurts."
BUFFY,(OS) I got it. Come here. You're gonna be okay.
BUFFY,Go!
DAWN,"Buffy, it's started."
ANYA,Xander!
XANDER,Anya!
DAWN,(tearful) I'm sorry.
BUFFY,It doesn't matter.
BUFFY,What are you doing?
DAWN,I have to jump. The energy.
BUFFY,It'll kill you.
DAWN,"(softly) I know. (Buffy staring at her) Buffy, I know about the ritual. I have to stop it."
BUFFY,No.
DAWN,I have to. Look at what's happening.
DAWN,"Buffy, you have to let me go. Blood starts it, and until the blood stops flowing, it'll never stop."
DAWN,(tearfully) You know you have to let me. It has to have the blood.
SPIKE,Cause it's always got to be blood.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,It's Summers blood. It's just like mine.
BUFFY,She's me. The monks made her out of me.
FIRST SLAYER,Death is your gift.
BUFFY,Death...
FIRST SLAYER VOICEOVER,...is your gift.
DAWN,Buffy ... no!
BUFFY,"Dawnie, I have to."
DAWN,No!
BUFFY,"Listen to me. Please, there's not a lot of time, listen."
BUFFY VOICEOVER,"Dawn, listen to me. Listen."
BUFFY VOICEOVER,I love you. I will *always* love you.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,But this is the work that I have to do.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,"Tell Giles ... tell Giles I figured it out. And, and I'm okay."
BUFFY VOICEOVER,And give my love to my friends.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,You have to take care of them now.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,You have to take care of each other.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,You have to be strong.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,"Dawn, the hardest thing in this world ... is to live in it."
BUFFY,Be brave. Live.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,For me.
Cut to,"graveyard, day. It's sunny and pretty with lots of trees and grass. Zoom in slowly on a headstone. A small bunch of flowers lies on the grass in front of it."
The headstone reads,
Executive Producer,Joss Whedon.
