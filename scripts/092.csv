GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
SPIKE,Look at you. All afraid I'm hot for your honey.
RILEY,Because you are.
SPIKE,They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life. So they sent the key to her ... in the form of a sister.
DAWN,I'm not real.
BEN,"You're the key. Go. Before she finds you, don't- she's here!"
DAWN,"Ben. He was here, he was trying to help me. He might have left before Glory came. I can't remember."
"Episode begins: Loud rock music. Fade in on a large sign reading ""Grand Opening"" with a piece of paper stuck in between the words reading ""RE"" (as in, Grand Re-Opening). Pan across to a neon sign holding the Bronze's new logo",the word Bronze in pink in a futuristic script.
SPIKE,"(OS) Bleedin' crime, is what it is."
SPIKE,Jackin' up the bar price to pay for fixin' up this sinkhole. Not my fault insurance doesn't cover act of troll.
BUFFY,"Gee, maybe it's time you found a new place to patronize."
SPIKE,(sits back) I've half a mind to! Especially since the flowering onion got remodeled off the sodding menu. (leans forward) 'S the only thing this place had going for it.
BUFFY,(frowns) What are you doing?
SPIKE,"(frowns) Wha, what do you mean what am ... I ..."
BUFFY,Here? At this table? Talking to me. Like we're some kind of talking buddies.
SPIKE,"Well, I saw you ... sitting here alone. Thought, I don't know, you could, maybe do with a bit of, uh, you know, company."
SPIKE,Suit yourself!
SPIKE,(OS) Although...
SPIKE,"It's just, we took on that Glory chippie together, I was right there with you, fightin' the fight."
BUFFY,"Actually, you were sleeping the sleep of the knocked unconscious."
SPIKE,"Still, points for intent. (Buffy looks doubtful) You'd think that would be enough to cut me a sliver of slack. Earn a little consideration, respect."
XANDER,"(OS) Hey, uh, Evil Dead, you're in my seat."
SPIKE,Bugger it.
ANYA,"Xander, I think you may have hurt his feelings."
XANDER,"And you should never hurt the feelings of a brutal killer. (ponders) You know, that's, uh, that's actually some pretty good advice."
XANDER,"So, who's up for some more liquid refreshments? I'm buying, for I am payday man."
WILLOW,(opening a bottle of aspirin) I could use a water.
XANDER,"(raises a hand dismissively) Water poses no challenge for payday man, for I have... (pauses, looks dismayed)"
XANDER,"(OS) Hey, where's my change?"
XANDER,"Spike, you diabolical fiend."
BUFFY,Poor Will. Still getting those headaches?
WILLOW,"Fewer and further between, but...yep, they're still exercising their visitation rights."
TARA,"Honey, in case you didn't hear me the first six thousand times, no more teleportation spells."
WILLOW,"Well, it's just we have squat in the way of Glory-fighting arsenal, and ... another run-in with her and my headaches and nosebleeds are gonna be the least of our problems."
BUFFY,You know what? This is the first R-'n'-R I've had in weeks. How about we go one night without saying the name Glory.
TARA,"I'm down with that. Let's just call ""she who will not be named"" another name. Let's just call her-"
BUFFY,Ben!
TARA,(OS) For example.
BUFFY,I'll be right back.
BUFFY,Ben! Hey!
BEN,"Buffy, hi."
BUFFY,I barely recognized you without your hospital scrubs.
BEN,"Oh, you'd be surprised the extent of my wardrobe."
BUFFY,Really?
BEN,I actually have entire outfits that aren't blue pajamas.
BUFFY,"(laughs) Um, my sister ... uh, told me what happened at the hospital before I got there."
BEN,(wary) Uh huh.
BUFFY,"And, uh, I just wanted to say ... thanks. (Ben looks confused) For looking after her?"
BEN,"(sighs, smiles) That's okay. I'm glad Dawn's all right."
XANDER,"The point is, I work hard for that money."
SPIKE,And you're saying I didn't?
XANDER,You stole it.
SPIKE,And you're making it into very hard work!
XANDER,"Listen, bleach boy, I don't have a chip in my head. I can do far more damage to you than you can ever do to me."
SPIKE,"(distracted, still watching Buffy) Yeah? Like you could ever hurt me."
Cut to,"train station. A porter leans against a fence reading a Spiderman comic as a train approaches, the horn blowing. It comes to a stop."
PORTER,Sunnydale Station! Last stop this line.
PORTER,Oh god! Oh please! Help me! Somebody please! Help me!
JOYCE,(looking toward the door) Buffy?
BUFFY,I'm back by popular demand.
GILES,Did you have a nice time?
BUFFY,"(ponders, sits) You know, I think I did. Much-needed fun, apart from Willow's headaches and Spike's cameo appearance."
DAWN,Spike was there?
BUFFY,Unfortunately.
JOYCE,"Well, I'm relieved that you're home. Because to be honest, I wasn't feeling all that safe with you gone."
JOYCE,"(quickly) At first. And then I, um, remembered that, um, Rupert was here and I felt much, much safer."
GILES,"(puts down book, gets up) Yes, well, thank you for the little backpedal, but uh, I'm forced to agree that I'm ... barely an adequate substitute for a Slayer in the house. (moves toward the door) Good night."
JOYCE,Good night.
BUFFY,So how is Dawn?
GILES,"She's, uh, she's coping very well. Extremely well, really, considering the extraordinary circumstances of her origin."
BUFFY,"Then lemme ask you something. Um, we've been going easy on her the last week ... letting things slide?"
GILES,"Oh, I don't think that's at all wise."
BUFFY,You don't?
GILES,"No, the best thing you can do now is behave exactly as you always have. Any special treatment at this stage is likely to undermine Dawn's sense of normality."
BUFFY,You think so?
GILES,Absolutely.
BUFFY,(nods) Thanks. (turns around and yells sharply) Dawn!!
DAWN,What?!
BUFFY,What did I tell you about borrowing my clothing?
DAWN,I didn't take your clothes.
BUFFY,Bull!
DAWN,I never touched your stuff.
BUFFY,Really. Then what happened to my blue cashmere sweater?
HARMONY,(OS) Spikey...
HARMONY,Aren't you coming to bed?
SPIKE,I'm not tired.
HARMONY,Me neither.
HARMONY,Don't you wanna come in and ... tire me out?
SPIKE,Harm ... (she kisses his ear) really not in the mood right now.
HARMONY,(annoyed) You're never in the mood! (kisses his ear again) We could do something different tonight.
SPIKE,"Like what, you stop yammering for two seconds?"
HARMONY,"(caressing his face) Well, we could ... I don't know ... maybe play a game?"
Cut to,"Harmony jumping out of the shadows, wearing Buffy's blue sweater and a pair of tight brown leather pants, holding a stake. She stalks dramatically around the crypt."
HARMONY,"Oh, I'm gonna stake you! (looks around) I'm coming after you, you bad, evil vampire, (gestures with the stake) and I'm gonna slay you! (pauses and thinks for a moment) I'm sneaking up, and I'm going to stake you so much with my slaying powers that I have because I'm the chosen-"
HARMONY,"(OS) Oh, Spike!"
Cut to,"exterior UC Sunnydale building, day."
WILLOW VOICEOVER,I just don't see why he couldn't end up with Esmerelda.
WILLOW,They could have the wedding right there. Beneath the very bell-tower where he labored thanklessly for all those years.
TARA,"No, see, it can't, it can't end like that, 'cause all of Quasimodo's actions were selfishly motivated. He had no moral compass, no understanding of right. Everything he did, he did out of love for a woman who would never be able to love him back. (They come to a vending machine and stop walking. Tara digs in her purse. Willow looks in hers as well) Also, you can tell it's not gonna have a happy ending when the main guy's all bumpy."
WILLOW,"What did you think, Buffy?"
BUFFY,"The test isn't till tomorrow, right? (shrugs) I don't have an opinion till then."
WILLOW,"But, you read it, right?"
BUFFY,Kinda not. I rented the movie.
TARA,"(takes her snack out of machine) Oh, with, um, with Charles Laughton?"
BUFFY,I don't know. Was he one of the singing gargoyles?
WILLOW,Oh boy. (They all begin to walk off)
BUFFY,"What, I, I'm kidding! (notices a guy reading a newspaper) You're done with this? (grabs the paper from him)"
GUY,"Yeah, hi, uh, kind of reading that?"
Shot of front page of the <I>Sunnydale Press</I> reading,"""METROTRAIN MURDER. Six Found Murdered on Train at Sunnydale Station."""
BUFFY,"""Six found murdered on train at Sunnydale Station."""
TARA,Glory?
BUFFY,"(shakes her head) ""Unconfirmed reports of severe trauma to the throats of one or more of the victims."" (lowers the paper) Survey says ... vampire."
Cut to,"Spike climbing up some stairs, emerging in his crypt. A woman is watching him; we only see her from the back. Spike reaches the top of the stairs, sees her and gasps in surprise."
SPIKE,"Oh, it's you. (frowns) What are you doing here lurking about?"
DAWN,I'm not lurking. I'm looking. What are you doing?
SPIKE,(nervous) Nothing.
DAWN,"So is that how you get around town in the daytime? I mean, does that lead into the sewers or something? Can you show me?"
SPIKE,"No. (moves forward) Why are you- (pauses, sighs) Does Buffy know you're here? (takes out a cigarette, lights it)"
DAWN,"Yeah, right. (turns and walks a little bit away) 'Cause nothing would make her happier than to find out I'm hanging out after school in the vampire's lair. Especially yours."
SPIKE,(snaps off his lighter in annoyance) Go home then.
DAWN,I don't feel like it right now.
SPIKE,"Well, you can't bloody well stay here."
DAWN,Why not?
SPIKE,"Because, I've got things to do."
SPIKE,"Bad, evil things! (Dawn tries to stifle a grin) That are not for a child's eyes."
DAWN,(stops smiling) I'm not a child. (goes to lean against a pillar) I'm not even human. Not originally.
SPIKE,"(sighs) Yeah, well, originally I was. I got over it. (Sits on the edge of a coffin) Doesn't seem to me it matters very much how you start out."
DAWN,That's smart. I get that. (pauses) I like how you talk to me like I can understand things. Everyone else is being all ... twitchy and secretive.
SPIKE,"They're just trying to keep you safe, I expect."
DAWN,I feel safe with you.
SPIKE,Take that back!
DAWN,"(quickly) I, I mean, you have that whole ... superpower thing, and ... you're just as tough as Buffy is, maybe tougher. (quieter) Buffy thinks so too."
SPIKE,She does?
DAWN,"Well, she's always worried about what she's gonna do if you ever get that chip out of your head."
SPIKE,"Is that right? So, um... (He sits back down on the coffin and Dawn leans back against the pillar) what else does Buffy say about me?"
Cut to,"Buffy entering the Summers house, day, holding an armful of books."
BUFFY,(calls) Hey!
JOYCE,(OS) Dawn?
BUFFY,"No, it's me."
JOYCE,Is Dawn with you?
BUFFY,Isn't she here?
JOYCE,"No, she didn't come home from school today. (anxious) Oh Buffy, the news said something about people murdered-"
BUFFY,"It's not Glory, it has nothing to do with Dawn, I promise. Look, she probably - I'll find her."
Cut to,"exterior, aerial shot of the graveyard, night."
DAWN VOICEOVER,And the lady just invited you in?
SPIKE,"Well, I had hubby by the throat, didn't I? Promised her he'd live if she gave me the invite."
DAWN,And did you? Let him live?
SPIKE,What do you think?
DAWN,(frowning) Huh.
SPIKE,Too much for you?
DAWN,(quickly) No! Keep going.
SPIKE,"(softly) And I kill 'em. Right quick, the whole lot. (Dawn looks fascinated) But... (grinning) There's someone missing. Supposed to be ... this little girl. So I get real quiet, (looking at ceiling) and I hear this tiny noise coming from the coal bin. This little sigh. (looks at Dawn) So I listened harder, it's very, very quiet..."
SPIKE,Oh ... bloody hell.
BUFFY,"Spike, I need your help, Dawn is- (Stops short when she sees Dawn) Here. (Spike gets down from the coffin)"
DAWN,"Spike was just telling a story, a-and he was just at this really cool part-"
BUFFY,(to Spike) What the hell is this? What is she doing here?
DAWN,Just hanging out.
BUFFY,(raises eyebrows) Here?
DAWN,Can you please let him finish the story? Then you could do the lecture?
BUFFY,Yeah. Okay. Let's hear the story that Spike is telling my little sister.
SPIKE,"(nervous) Right. Yeah. (Shot of the two girls watching, Dawn interested, Buffy with her arms folded) So, uh, I knew the girl was in the coal bin. So I rip it open, very violent, haul her out of there ... (looks at Buffy) and then I give her to a good family in a nice home, (Buffy rolls her eyes) where they're never ever mean to her, and didn't lock her in the coal bin."
DAWN,What? That's so lame!
SPIKE,(to Buffy) I was just about to send her home. I knew you'd be frettin'.
BUFFY,"Dawn, get your stuff, we're getting out of here."
BUFFY,Why doesn't that register with you? Crypt plus vampire equals bad.
DAWN,'Cause it was Spike!
BUFFY,"Hanging out with Spike is not cool, Dawn, okay? It is, it is dangerous, and ... icky."
DAWN,I don't think Spike's icky.
BUFFY,"Yeah, well, think again, sister-"
BUFFY,You have a crush on him.
DAWN,"No I don't! It's just, (giggles) he's got cool hair, and he wears cool leather coats and stuff. (stops smiling) And he doesn't treat me like an alien."
BUFFY,"He's a killer, Dawn. You cannot have a crush on something that is ... dead, and, and evil, and a vampire."
DAWN,"Right, that's why you were never with Angel for three years."
BUFFY,(quietly) Angel's different. He has a soul.
DAWN,Spike has a chip. Same diff.
BUFFY,"(turns away, gesturing angrily) I, I can't listen to this! (sighs, turns back) Spike is a monster, okay? A-and plus, you are only fourteen years old."
DAWN,"I like hanging out with him is all. And even if I did have a crush, he wouldn't notice in a million years. Not with you around."
BUFFY,What does that mean?
DAWN,Spike's totally into you.
DAWN,"Oh, come on. You didn't notice? Buffy, Spike is completely in love with you."
BUFFY,Huh?
XANDER,"So, tell me again what we're looking for?"
BUFFY,Clues.
XANDER,Ooooh-kay.
XANDER,Could you give me a clue about what kind of clues?
BUFFY,"Something. Anything. (looks around) Just wanna know this was a vamp attack. If it was, how many we're talking about."
XANDER,"Well, Sunnydale's finest didn't ... leave us a lot of stuff to examine ... who knows how many people have traipsed through here."
BUFFY,Xander?
XANDER,What?
BUFFY,Never mind.
BUFFY,I-it's just that ... Dawn ... said that...
XANDER,Yeah?
BUFFY,Forget it.
XANDER,Buffy! (walks toward her)
BUFFY,"She thinks that ... she said that ... (Xander nods, waits for it) Spike's in love with me."
BUFFY,I'm not joking.
XANDER,"(still laughing) Oh, I hope not. It's funnier if it's true."
BUFFY,"I'm serious. Xander, this is serious!"
XANDER,(seriously) All right. (clears throat)
BUFFY,It's creepy.
XANDER,"No. Not creepy. 'Cause it's not real! I mean, how upset can you really get over one of Spike's ... fevered daydreams that's not gonna happen?"
BUFFY,I guess.
XANDER,"So, where did Dawn, how did she come to this *extremely* ... entertaining conclusion?"
BUFFY,(gets up) She was hanging out with Spike. I think she has a crush on him.
XANDER,What?
BUFFY,"I mean, I always knew that he had this ... weird fixation with me..."
XANDER,I'm the one she has a crush on! Me!
BUFFY,(shakes head) There's nothing here. Let's go. (turns to leave)
XANDER,"It's always been me! Big funny Xander! Oh, what, she just suddenly decides I'm not the cool one any more? Why is that okay?"
Cut to,"Buffy entering her home, walking down the hall toward the kitchen."
JOYCE,"(OS) But what they didn't get was, that it was a copy of the bill of lading..."
JOYCE,"...so they thought that it was another order form, so now I've got two shipments of Greek amphorae on my hands!"
SPIKE,"That's funny. And really, how many do you need, amphorae?"
JOYCE,"(giggling) Oh, Buffy. Spike came by to apologize for yesterday. (puts her hands over Dawn's) Our missing child drama."
BUFFY,(nods) And he just decided to ... hang out for a while?
JOYCE,"Oh, well, I got talking about the gallery. See, there was this-"
SPIKE,"Oh, don't get us all laughing again, Joyce. Anyhow, I really need to talk to your eldest."
BUFFY,What about?
SPIKE,I got a bit of info you might be keen on knowin'.
BUFFY,"Sorry, all out of cash. Why don't you hit on Giles - hit *up* Giles."
SPIKE,I got a bead on the guy who killed those people. The ones on the train.
BUFFY,Do tell.
SPIKE,"(jerking his head to indicate she should come with him) I'll do better than that, I'll show."
SPIKE,What's the matter?
BUFFY,(nervous) Nothing ... just...
SPIKE,"(sighs, rolls his eyes) Two vamps holed up in a warehouse downtown. Come on, what are you waiting for, grab your coat and your pointy sticks."
Cut to,"Spike and Buffy sitting in a car watching a warehouse. Spike looks at Buffy. She gives him a sharp look back. He looks away. Buffy frowns at him, looking very suspicious and nervous."
BUFFY,Hey!
BUFFY,Ew.
SPIKE,"It's not blood, it's bourbon."
BUFFY,(slower) Eeeeew.
SPIKE,(grins ruefully) Suit yourself.
SPIKE,"(sings) I wanna be sedated... (stops singing, looks at Buffy) Do you like the Ramones?"
BUFFY,"So if you're not doing this for the money, why *are* y-"
SPIKE,Shh!
VAMP 1,The Slayer!
SPIKE,"Well, that was sad. (Buffy moves forward, looking around) I'm embarrassed for our kind."
"Spike comes forward, goes a few steps in the direction the vampires went. (continuity note",the popcorn disappears at this point)
SPIKE,"So. Should we chase after 'em, then? They couldn't have gone far."
BUFFY,These vamps have been here for a while. They've nested.
SPIKE,So ... you're saying they're a couple of poofters?
BUFFY,No. I'm saying they had nothing to do with last night's murders.
SPIKE,How do you figure?
BUFFY,Whoever did it only arrived in town last night. Looks like you've wasted my time.
BUFFY,What are you doing?
SPIKE,"(looks at the door) I, I was ... (scoffs) I wasn't thinking."
BUFFY,What is this?
SPIKE,"Oh, come- (shoves the door closed) don't get your knickers twisted, I was-"
BUFFY,"What ... is this? (Spike stares at her) The late-night stakeout, the bogus suspects, the flask? (Spike raises his eyebrows) Is this a date?"
SPIKE,(loudly) A d- Please! (pretending to be amused) A date? You are completely off your bird! I mean - (quietly) Do you want it to be?
BUFFY,(upset) Oh my god.
BUFFY: Oh ... oh no. (turns back to Spike) Are you out of your mind? (continuity note,the popcorn reappears)
SPIKE,It's not so unusual. (walks toward her) Two people ... in the workplace ... feelings develop.
BUFFY,"No! No, no, feelings do not develop. No feelings."
SPIKE,You can't deny it. There's something between us.
BUFFY,Loathing. Disgust.
SPIKE,Heat. Desire.
BUFFY,"Please! Spike, you're a vampire."
SPIKE,Angel was a vampire.
BUFFY,Angel was good!
SPIKE,"And I can be too. I've changed, Buffy."
BUFFY,"What, that chip in your head? That's not change. Tha-that's just ... holding you back. You're like a serial killer in prison!"
SPIKE,Women marry 'em all the time!
BUFFY,Uhh!
SPIKE,(realizing that's not what he meant) But I'm not ... like that. Something's happening to me. I can't stop thinking about you.
BUFFY,Uhh. (turns away)
SPIKE,And if that means turning my back on the whole evil thing-
BUFFY,(turns back) You don't know what you mean! You don't know what feelings are!
SPIKE,(offended) I damn well do! I lie awake every night!
BUFFY,You sleep during the day!
SPIKE,"Yeah, but - (through his teeth) You are missing the point. This is real here. I love-"
BUFFY,Don't!
BUFFY,Don't say it. (Spike stares at her) I'm going.She starts to walk toward the door again.
SPIKE,"Oh, come on, we need to talk-"
BUFFY,"(turns back) We don't need to do anything! Okay, there is no we! Understand?"
SPIKE,Buffy.
Cut to,"Spike entering his crypt, moving slowly. It's dark. He walks in, makes a face and puts his hand to his face. Suddenly there's a sniffling noise. Spike looks up, looks around suspiciously."
SPIKE,Who's there?
VOICE,"A happy memory, pretty Spike."
DRUSILLA,Look who's come to make everything right again.
SPIKE,"So, uh, let me get this straight. Darla got mojo'd back from the beyond ... you vamped her... (camera pulls back so we can see Dru circling behind him) ...and now she and you are working on turning Angel into his own bad self again."
DRUSILLA,Mm-hmm.
SPIKE,Sounds fun.
DRUSILLA,It is. Like lollipops at the circus. Although ... didn't care for Angelus setting us on fire. (She touches her cheek and chest where we can see still-healing burn marks.)
SPIKE,"And this has got you, what, all nostalgic now, has it?"
DRUSILLA,"I want us to be a family again, my William."
DRUSILLA,(whispers) Come back with me. (pulls back to look at him)
SPIKE,"To Los Angeles? (she nods) I've done the whole L.A. scene, Dru. Didn't agree with me. (walks away) Besides, I've got a sweet little setup here in Sunny-D. (gestures around) Decent digs... (sits in his armchair) not to mention all the tasty townies I can eat."
DRUSILLA,Naughty! Shh. (puts finger to her lips) You needn't make up stories. I already know why you're not coming. Poor boy. (puts hands to her head) Tin soldiers put funny little knick-knacks in your brain. Can't hunt! Can't hurt! Can't kill!
DRUSILLA,You've got a chip.
SPIKE,"Right, so you've heard. Poor Spike's become a cautionary tale for vampires, right? ""You better be good, kiddies, or else they might wire you up someday!"" (Kicks something across the room)"
DRUSILLA,I don't believe in science. All those bits and molecules no one's ever seen. I trust eyes and heart alone. (Walks over to him) And do you know what mine is singing out right now?
DRUSILLA,"You're a killer. Born to slash ... and bash ... and... (gives a little gasp of pleasure) oh, bleed like beautiful poetry."
DRUSILLA,No little tinker-toy could ever stop you from flowing.
SPIKE,(whispers) Yeah.
DRUSILLA,Ohh.
SPIKE,"(shakes his head, removes his hand from her) But the pain ... love, you don't understand, it's ... it's searing. It's, um, blinding."
DRUSILLA,"All in your head. I can see it. Little bit of ... plastic, spiderwebbing out nasty blue shocks. (moves her fingers across his head imitating a spider) And every one is a lie. (Spike keeps his head bent) Electricity lies, Spike. It tells you you're not a bad dog, but you are."
HARMONY,(OS) What the heck is this?
SPIKE,"Oh, bloody hell."
HARMONY,"Who is - oh, wait. I get it. Our little sex game was just the beginning. Now you've gone and picked up some cheap queen of the damned to dress up like your precious Drood-zilla."
SPIKE,Harm.
HARMONY,"You'd better not be thinking what I think you're thinking. 'Cause my answer is the same as always. No threesomes unless it's (gestures to Spike) boy, (gestures to the air) boy, (gestures to herself) girl. Or Charlize Theron."
SPIKE,"Harm, you moron, this *is* Drusilla."
HARMONY,"Oh. Well, (walks toward Dru) you've got some nerve showing up here like this. After all this time. After breaking my sweet boo-boo's heart."
HARMONY,"Do you have any idea how hard it's been to break down the walls he put up after you left? I mean, *serious* trust issues."
SPIKE,Harm...
HARMONY,"So it's no use you crawling back to him, 'cause Spikey don't play that game any more, Morticia."
SPIKE,"(looking at Dru) It's been fun while it lasted, Harm, (Dru smiles) but I think it'd be best now if you hit the road."
HARMONY,Why? Because she's back?
SPIKE,(still looking at Dru) No. (moves closer to Dru) Because I am.
DRUSILLA,"And there you are, my darling, deadly boy."
Cut to,"Joyce, Buffy, and Willow sitting in the Summers living room."
WILLOW,"Well, he ... he actually told you? He, he said, ""I love you""?"
BUFFY,"Well, I-I didn't let him get that far, but ... I could see the words coming."
JOYCE,"Honey, did you ... somehow, unintentionally, lead him on in any way? Uh, send him signals?"
BUFFY,"(ponders) Well, I ... I do beat him up a lot. For Spike that's like third base."
WILLOW,"Buffy, um ... I'm really worried."
JOYCE,So am I. He could become dangerous.
BUFFY,"Not really. As long as it's still chips ahoy in Spike's head he can't hurt me, or any of us. You know, besides, this'll probably just blow over. You know? It's just some weird Spike thing. He'll have the hots for some gak demon before we know it."
WILLOW,"I don't know. Uh, these things can, can become pretty twisted."
JOYCE,"(comes back to sit down again) Yeah, and Spike, I mean, he's..."
BUFFY,Pretty twisted.
JOYCE,Yeah.
WILLOW,"Well, well, you made it clear, right? That it could never happen. That there's no possible way. Ever."
BUFFY,"Yeah! (looks at them) I, I think so. I don't know, I, I was just so thrown."
WILLOW,"Well, Buffy, you have to talk to him again."
BUFFY,"What? No. No, no, no, I have to avoid him again."
WILLOW,"Not until you shut him down completely. If he thinks there's even a little chance with you, there's no telling what he'll do."
JOYCE,"I know this is hard, honey, but I think you made the right decision."
JOYCE,Better to nip this in the bud before-
BUFFY,The bud nips me?
JOYCE,Exactly.
WILLOW,"If you want, Buffy, I can go with. Back you up with some scowling."
BUFFY,"Thanks, but ... I think this is something I have to do myself. Besides, you know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this, this whole thing's just been blown way out of proportion and ... he's already gone back to wanting me dead."
WILLOW,Here's hoping. (Grins and holds up both hands with the fingers crossed)
BUFFY,"You know what, though? There is one thing you can do for me while I'm gone."
BUFFY,Spike? ... Are you here?
BUFFY,Spike?
SPIKE,See anything interesting?
BUFFY,"(continues climbing out) Spike. I, uh ... what ... (begins backing up as Spike advances on her) what happened?"
DRUSILLA,(OS) Me.
SPIKE,"You remember my ex, don't you, Slayer?"
SPIKE,"Come back, she did. Couldn't live without me."
DRUSILLA,My boy's been feeding again. But I know what he really wants to eat.
DRUSILLA,Shall we tie her up? (licks her finger) Play with her a teensy bit first.
SPIKE,"(pensively, looking at Buffy) I'm through playing."
DRUSILLA,(delighted) Oooh. I like it when you're all dour and straight to business-like.
SPIKE,(quietly) Bloody well through playing.
SPIKE,(OS) There she is.
SPIKE,Beginning to think you'd sleep the night away.
BUFFY,Dru ... Drusilla?
DRUSILLA,"Not nice to change the game in mid-play, Spike. You've taken my chair and the music hasn't stopped."
SPIKE,"Sorry, pet. My house, my rules."
DRUSILLA,I think I shall be very cross with you when I'm free again.
BUFFY,What's going on?
SPIKE,Simple. I'm gonna prove something. (moves up close to her) I love you.
BUFFY,Oh my god.
SPIKE,"No, look at me! (grabs her chin and forces her to look at him) I ... love you. (Buffy jerks her chin out of his hand) You're all I bloody think about. Dream about. You're in my gut ... my throat ... I'm drowning in you, Summers, I'm drowning in you."
SPIKE,"I can do without the laugh track, Dru."
DRUSILLA,But it's so funny. I knew ... before you did. I knew you loved the Slayer. The pixies in my head whispered it to me.
SPIKE,You can't tell me that there isn't anything there between you and me. I know you feel something.
BUFFY,"It's called revulsion. And whatever you think you're feeling, it's not love. You can't love without a soul."
DRUSILLA,"Oh, we can, you know. We can love quite well. If not wisely."
SPIKE,"(to Buffy) You still don't believe. Still don't think I mean it. You want proof, huh? How's this?"
SPIKE,I'm gonna kill Drusilla for you.
BUFFY,"That doesn't prove anything ... except that you're a sick miserable vampire that I should have dusted a long time ago. And, hey, already there."
SPIKE,Don't mock this.
BUFFY,Go mock yourself.
SPIKE,"This is Drusilla, girl! You have the slightest idea what she means to me? It's the face of my salvation! (looks at Dru, smiles slightly) She delivered me from mediocrity. For over a century we ... cut a swath through continents. A hundred years, she never stopped surprising me."
SPIKE,(quietly) Never stopped taking me to new depths. I was a lucky bloke. (Dru smiles) Just to touch such a black beauty.
DRUSILLA,Aw...
DRUSILLA,Ow.
SPIKE,"(turning to look at Buffy) So you see, it means something."
BUFFY,"Not to me. Kill her, why do I care?"
SPIKE,"Here's why. (walks toward Buffy) If you don't admit ... that there's something there ... some tiny feeling for me ... then I'll untie Dru, let her kill you instead."
DRUSILLA,"(nodding quickly) Yes, please. I like that game much more."
SPIKE,"Just ... give me something ... a crumb ... a barest smidgen ... tell me ... maybe, someday, there's a chance."
BUFFY,Spike....
BUFFY,The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
SPIKE,"(puzzled) Oh, what... (makes a face of extreme frustration) Ohh!"
SPIKE,(shouting) Gaaah! What the bleeding hell is wrong with you bloody women? What the hell does it take? Why ... do you bitches torture me?
BUFFY,Which question do you want me to answer first?
SPIKE,"Look, I, I'm at the end of my bleeding tether. You know? I don't even know why I even bother, you know. (points at Dru) This is your fault. You're the one to blame for all this."
DRUSILLA,Am I?
SPIKE,"(shouting) Bloody right you are! If you hadn't left me for that chaos demon, I never would have come back here! Never would have had this sodding chip in my skull! And you - (to Buffy) wouldn't be able to touch me, because this, (pointing to Buffy, then to himself) with you, is wrong. I know it. I'm not a complete idiot."
SPIKE,"You think I like having you in here? Destroying everything that was me, until all that's left is you, in a dead shell. (scoffs) You say you hate it, but you won't leave. You know, what I should just do, is get rid of both of you. Burn you. Cut you into little pieces (makes scissor gesture with his fingers) so there won't be any more bints to cock up things for Spi-"
SPIKE,"Oh, great."
HARMONY,"(OS) What about me, Spike?"
HARMONY,You forget about me again? The *actual* girlfriend?
HARMONY,I gave you the best ... bunch of months of my life!
DRUSILLA,"That's right, little girl. Teach our naughty boy a lesson."
SPIKE,"(still on the floor) Oh, so now you're all ganging up."
HARMONY,"I thought I could change you, Spike. I thought maybe if I gave and I gave and gave, maybe you'd come around. Maybe be a little nicer. Stop treating me like your dog. (begins reloading the crossbow) But now I see it's you. You're the dog. Who needs to be put d-"
HARMONY,"Ow, you're on my hair!"
DRUSILLA,Poor Spike... (shot of Spike and Buffy staring at her) so lost. (tearfully) Even I can't help you now.
HARMONY,(OS) Oh Spikey.
HARMONY,And you can say good-bye to this (pointing at her butt) because you're not gonna see it any more ever. (thinks) Unless you run into me somewhere and it's me walking away from you.
HARMONY,But even then ... I'll probably just ... you know ... back away.
Cut to,Buffy walking quickly down the street near her home. Spike runs up behind her.
SPIKE,"Buffy! Come on now, stop."
SPIKE,You can't just walk away from this.
BUFFY,What part of punching you in the face do you not understand?
SPIKE,"So we had a fight. It's not our first, love, and it doesn't change anything."
BUFFY,"(stops walking, turns to him angrily) It changes everything, Spike! I want you out. I want you out of this town, I want you off this planet! You don't come near me, my friends, or my family again ever! Understand?"
SPIKE,"No, it's not that easy. We have something, Buffy. (Buffy is walking up the stairs to the front door of her house. Spike follows) It's not pretty, but it's real, and there's nothing either one of us can do about it."
SPIKE,"Like it or not, I'm in your life, you can't just shut me out."
