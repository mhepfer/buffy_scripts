character,dialogue
Faith,I'm Faith.
Mayor,Open your present.
Faith,"(Opens it, takes out knife) This is a thing of beauty, boss."
Mayor,That look on your face is my reward.
Giles,(VO)We have a rogue Slayer on our hands. I can't think of anything more dangerous.
Doctor,It's a wonder she's alive at all with the blood loss. There's virtually no chance that she'll ever regain consciousness.
Riley,You're really strong. I like it.
Walsh,I've worked too long... too long to let some little bitch threaten this project.
Giles,Maggie Walsh...set you up?
Walsh,Adam.....
Adam,Mommy.
Riley,Why does it bug you so much that I'm hanging with her?
Forrest,It bugs me that she's using you to infiltrate our operation.
Riley,You saying she's a spy?
Riley,I don't know what's going on...who the bad guys are...
Forrest,Escort them out.
Riley,Buffy....
Buffy,They smell good don't they?
Faith,What?
Buffy,Clean sheets. Like summer.
Faith,I wouldn't know.
Buffy,Right. I forgot.
Faith,I noticed.
Buffy,"I wish I could stay, but..."
Faith,"Oh, you have to go."
Buffy,That's just what...
Faith,Little sis coming. I know.
Buffy,So much to do before she gets here.
Buffy,Now I really have to...
Faith,So go. Don't let me keep.
Fait,Damn. Just when we'd made it so nice. (They look at knife in Faith's gut) Are you ever gonna take this thing out?
Xander,"So, here it is. The latest in state-of-the-art combat technology. I gotta say, it doesn't look that complicated."
Buffy,So can you repair it?
Xander,Sure. As soon as I get my master's degree in advanced starship technology. (Slams down blaster.)
Willow,"Well, why don't we experiment? Press some buttons, see what happens."
Giles,I'd like to veto that.
Xander,"Second. It's called a blaster, Will, a word that tends to discourage experimentation. Now, if it were called the Orgazmater, I'd be the first to try your basic button press approach."
Buffy,Just tell me. Can you repair it or not?
Xander,"I'm working on it, I'm working on it. (Continues to work on it) I blow a whole in my mom's exterior patch then the neighbours will not be pleased."
Giles,Are you alright? (Goes to sit next to her) You've been patrolling round the clock for three days straight now. I thought you could use some...
Buffy,"What? Some rest? There's a demonoid killing machine out there Giles, it doesn't only work the night shift."
Giles,"I was going to say perhaps you could use some backup, but um....now you mention it, building up your strength may not be a bad idea."
Buffy,Just get the blaster working. That's all the strength I need.
Willow,Are you sure?
Buffy,"Why? Because ray guns aren't in the Slayer handbook? Well, you haven't seen this Adam thing. He's the Terminator without the bashful charm. He's deadly, and the last time we met, he kicked my ass."
Willow,"Oh no, blast away, by all means. I only meant....no word about Riley?"
Buffy,They keep telling me that he's fine. That's all they'll say.
Willow,Maybe they're telling the truth.
Buffy,"Maybe. I don't even know what the Initiative's version of ""fine"" is. I mean, they could be forcing him back onto medication or torturing him for all I know."
Giles,"From what we've seen, I doubt they'll be trying to hurt him."
Buffy,The only thing I know for certain is that my boyfriend is locked away and I'm not helping.
Willow,"Maybe Giles has a point. I mean, Riley is their top gun guy. Doesn't make sense that they'd hurt him."
Buffy,"All I know is that the Initiative has all those brain-washy, behaviour modification guys."
Willow,So?
Buffy,So what happens when they start not liking his behaviour?
Riley,"Stand down, soldier. (No response) Stand down before I put you down."
Forrest,(To guard) You heard the man. At ease.
Forrest,"The shish kebab that walks like a man. Looks like you're feeling better. Walking around, threatening people and all that."
Riley,He was in my way. I got places to be.
Forrest,Really. And where were you thinking of going?
Riley,You know where I'm going.
Forrest,(Sighs) Don't even tell me you're headed to that girlfriend of yours. (Gets in Riley's way) Look at you. One good injury and you're back in intensive care to stay.
Riley,You wouldn't understand.
Forrest,How about you explain it to me then?
Guard,We all friends here fellows?
Forrest,Absolutely. Riley here was about to explain why he's leaving us so very quickly.
Riley,I don't explain. Because I don't have to. I'm the one in charge.
Forrest,Things change.
Riley,Do they?
Forrest,"Hey! In case you failed to notice, we're in a world of hurt around here. Now's the time for us to band together, not go flying off our separate ways."
Guard,"Forrest has a point, Riley."
Forrest,"We have a problem, we deal with that problem. You know, the most important part of the equation now is that we keep said problem within the family."
Riley,Family? Is that what we are? Step aside.
Mayor,Nonsense. It's a beautiful day. Now eat your sandwich.
Faith,I dunno. It just always seems like it starts raining about now.
Mayor,"You're too young and too pretty a girl to start wearing worry lines on your face. (Picks worm off blanket) Hey there, little fella. I dunno where you belong, butit's not here with us. (Chuckles) There you go. (Puts the worm back in the soil. Talks to Faith again) Y'see, there's nothing gonna spoil our time together. Who wants cheese cake? (Chuckles)"
Faith,NO!
Buffy,(To Faith) I told you I had things to do.
Willow,Spread out.
Buffy,Not too far.
Xander,So not a problem.
Buffy,I've never seen anything like that.
Xander,And I can go a long healthy stretch without seeing anything like that again.
Willow,"It had to be Adam who killed it, but why?"
Buffy,"He's studying biology. Human, demon, whoever he can get his hands on and take apart."
Willow,He's finding out what makes things work.
Xander,I really don't want to be around for the final exam.
Buffy,It's not coming to that. The Initiative created this thing and they can't stop it. But we will.
Xander,Question: Will hiding in a cavern with stockpiled chocolate goods be any part of this plan?
Buffy,No.
Xander,(To Willow) Told you.
Willow,What's first?
Buffy,"Riley. I'm not leaving him down there with the people that created this thing. I don't care how many guns they have, I'm going in. Okay. Will, I need you to hack into their security mainframe and buy me a ten minute shut down of operation systems."
Willow,That could be...
Buffy,"Tricky. Not impossible. If you can't do it online, then use magic. Xander, any gear you've been saving for a rainy day, I want you to give to me."
Xander,You want stealth stuff?
Buffy,"No, we tried sneaking in. This time, we're gonna use force. I figure I'll go in through the elevator shaft, use the cable as towlines. Then blast open the facility doors and find the infirmary."
Riley,Am I really worth all that?
Buffy,"(Spins around) Riley! (Hugs him. He flinches) Oh God, I'm sorry! Did I hurt you?"
Riley,"No, a giant skewer through the rib cage hurt me. That was just a reminder."
Buffy,How did you get out?
Riley,I walked.
Willow,They didn't try to stop you?
Riley,"Oh, they did. Repeatedly. But then I told them they couldn't keep me without a major ass-kicking, one way or another. So here I am."
Xander,"That's.....great...Riley, and y'know...there's no polite way to ask you this, but...uh....did they put a chip in your brain? (Looks at his head)"
Riley,Beg your pardon?
Buffy,Forget it. We're just happy to have you back.
Willow,"Yeah, we were pretty worried about you for a while, mister."
Riley,"Me too. Hey, I know my behaviouir was pretty out there..."
Willow,"Forget it. Tell you what, you two crazy kids take down a killer cyber demon hybrid thingy and we'll call it all even."
Riley,Taking down Adam's gonna be tough. There's no way to predict what he'll throw at us.
Buffy,"You're here. Whatever comes, we can handle."
Faith,(Yanks it out) Owch.
Woman,Excuse me. You know how to get to third floor west?
Faith,What?
Woman,I see....you need some help or something?
Faith,Graduation.
Woman,What?
Faith,Graduation. I gotta get to Sunnydale High School graduation NOW.
Woman,"Well, you can't. I mean, Sunnydale High School isn't even there anymore."
Faith,What day is it?
Woman,Friday.
Faith,What date? The date.
Woman,February 25th.
Faith,What year?
Woman,Maybe I should get you a nurse...
Faith,What happened to the school?
Woman,Don't you just wanna....
Faith,Just tell me.
Woman,"Well, it was a tragedy really. Lots of students died. The Principal, the Mayor. I really think maybe I should get you some help."
Riley,Me neither. All I had in there was this one little part of you. (Gives her bandana piece)
Buffy,It's just the scarf part of me really.
Riley,Sure it is. Just knowing you were out there...that you cared...I think we're being watched.
Buffy,I dunno. Does the Initiative do that?
Riley,Maybe.
Buffy,You seem a little...somewhere else. Is there anything I can do?
Riley,Give me an order. That's what I do isn't it? Follow orders.
Buffy,You don't have to.
Riley,"Don't I? All my life that's what I've been groomed to do. They say jump, I ask ""How high?"", I get the job done. Just don't know if it's the right job anymore."
Buffy,I know how you feel. Giles used to be part of this Council. And for years all they ever did was give me orders.
Riley,Ever obey them?
Buffy,"Sure. The ones I was going to do anyway. The point is, I quit the Council. And I was scared. But it's okay now."
Riley,"Now, see, that's where you and I are different. I just suck at the whole gray area thing."
Buffy,"It's a choice. Go back in there and make some changes from the inside. Or you can quit the team, fight demons in your own way."
Riley,You make it sound so simple. I don't even know what my way is.
Buffy,"Well, it's time to find out."
Riley,"I'm a soldier. I got a way, which one of them?"
Buffy,"Good man. (They kiss. She sits in his lap, kisses him again.)"
Riley,What're you doing?
Buffy,I am looking for brain washy chips in your head.
Riley,Heh....finding any?
Buffy,"Not sure. But I should probably keep looking just in case. You've been strong long enough, Riley Finn. I'm here for you. And we're gonna find this demon, and we're gonna kill it together. And in the mean time, you are gonna stop torturing yourself."
Riley,Sure about that?
Buffy,It's an order. (They kiss again)
Doctor,What do you mean she just wasn't there?
Nurse,"I don't know. I came to check the monitors like I always do at eight o'clock. Eight o'clock is my shift, I got here on time."
Officer,You found the bed in this condition?
Nurse,Haven't touched a thing.
Doctor,Get the duty rosters and check the log. I wanna know exactly what happened. Coma patients do not just get up and walk away.
Nurse,We are checking every room on every floor.
Officer,Walk me through this one more time. You knew this woman was wanted for questioning on a series of murders and there's no security on this wing?
Doctor,You don't understand. There's no way that girl was gonna wake up.
Officer,Doctor...
Doctor,This can't be happening...
Nurse,Did you find her?
Nurse,"Another woman, unconscious and badly beaten. And she's been stripped."
Nurse,(Into phone) It's happened. Send the team.
Giles,(From inside) The problem for me seems to be why Adam ahs stayed dormant as long as he has.
Willow,"When he's not making performance art out of other demons, that is."
Riley,"He's probably working off an autonomic power source. And because he's straight out of the box, he needs to charge up a while."
Buffy,"Okay, what's he charging up for?"
Xander,"Based on the clues, I'll go with killing spree."
Riley,"And that's a best case scenario. I suppose a little fire power would be a good idea right now. (Activates blaster Xander had been messing with, much to Xander's amazement)"
Xander,Hey! How'd you do that? Is there like an On/Off button somewhere here?
Riley,Blasters are easy. Adam won't be.
Willow,"Since Professor Walsh designed it, any chance she left instructions lying around somewhere? (As she says this, Buffy kisses Riley and Faith reacts)"
Buffy,"Well, if she did, they're gonna be in the Initiative. (Faith continues to stare at Buffy and Riley)"
Giles,Which we can't get into without mounting a major offensive.
Riley,Speak for yourself. (All look at him.) I'm just saying.
Giles,"I must admit, a man on the inside would be..."
Buffy,A really good idea. Are you sure you wanna be double agent guy.
Riley,"I'm not exactly sure what you'd call me, but I will share information. (Faith is still looking at Riley.) It's the least I can do."
Xander,Riley's right. It is the least we can do.
Giles,"Hello. What? Yes, she is. (Motions to Buffy) Um...it's for you."
Buffy,"(Looking surprised)Hello? (Faith watches her expectantly) What sort of emergency? (Looks unhappy) No, I haven't. (Faith leaves) Thank you, I'll let you know. (Puts phone down)"
Giles,What is it?
Buffy,"It's Faith. She's awake. (All look surprised) She beat someone up, took her clothing and disappeared out of the hospital. No-one knows where she is."
Xander,"I'd say this qualifies for a ""Worst Timing Ever"" award."
Willow,What do we do?
Giles,"Well, we have to find her."
Willow,What about Adam?
Xander,I'd hate to see the pursuit of a homicidal lunatic get in the way of persuing a homicidal lunatic.
Buffy,"Well, Faith's not exactly low-profile girl. I'll patrol and wait for her to make a move."
Giles,But then what?
Willow,Oooh! I have an idea! Beat the crap out of her!
Xander,Good plan.
Buffy,Good on paper. But we still have a decision to make. Do we hand her over to the cops? They wouldn't know what to do with a Slayer even if they knew we existed.
Willow,What about the Council?
Xander,Been there. Tried that. Not unlike smothering a forest fire with napalm as I recall.
Giles,"Well, the Initiative, they do have containment facilities."
Xander,One word: Evil.
Buffy,"There's no way around it. Faith is back, and whether I like it or not, she's my responsibility."
Willow,"Yeah, too bad. That was out first coma ever."
Buffy,"We have no idea where she is. We don't know what she's thinking, what she's feeling..."
Xander,Who she's doing.
Buffy,She could be terrified. Maybe she doesn't even remember. Or maybe she does and she's sorry and she's alone hiding somewhere.
Giles,"Well, perhaps there's some form of rehabiliatation we just haven't thought about."
Willow,"And if not, ass-kicking makes a solid plan B."
Buffy,"I'm not going to rule it out. First thing, we need to find her. Then we can take it from there."
Riley,Who's Faith?
Willow,What did you tell him?
Buffy,"The truth? That she's my wacky identical cousin from England, and whenever she visits hi-jinks ensue?"
Willow,It's good you guys have such an honest relationship.
Buffy,"No, I told him the story. I vagued up a few bits, but no flat-out lies."
Willow,That's fair. How'd you handle the Angel-y parts?
Buffy,"I did some editing. It's not that I'm trying to hide anything from Riley, it's just that's a longer conversation, and I had a Faith-hunt to do."
Willow,Any luck?
Buffy,Couldn't find her. Don't know exactly where to place that little up-continuum.
Willow,At least you're not alone on this. I bet every cop in Sunnydale is out there looking for her right now.
Buffy,"Pressure's definitely on. I'm telling you, if I were her, I'd get outta Dodge post hasty."
Faith,But you're not me.
Faith,"So, check you out B. Nice, the big girl on campus thing's really working for you."
Buffy,I've been looking for you.
Faith,"I've been standing still for eight months, B. How hard did you look?"
Buffy,Are you alright?
Faith,Five-by-five. It's that thing about a coma. Wake up all rested and rejuvinated. And ready for payback.
Buffy,"So much for pleasantries, huh?"
Faith,"What did you think, I'd wake up and we'd go for tea? You tried to gut me, bonny."
Faith,Lets have another go at it. See who ends on top.
Buffy,"It doesn't have to be like this, y'know."
Faith,"Actually, I think it has to be exactly like this."
Buffy,"Faith, these are innocent people."
Faith,No such animal.
Buffy,I guess it was too much to hope that you'd use your downtime to reflect and grow.
Faith,"I could say the same about you. I mean, you're still the same better-than-thou Buffy. I mean, I knew it somehow. I kept having this dream, I'm not sure what it means, but in the dream the self-righteous blond chick stabs me, and you wanna know why?"
Buffy,You had it coming.
Faith,"That's one interpretation, but in my dream, she does it for a guy."
Faith,"(To Willow) Try it red, and you'll lose an arm. (Back to Buffy) I wake up to find the blond chick isn't even dating the guy she was so nuts about before. I mean, she's moved on to the first college beefstick she meets. Not only has she forgotten about the love of her life, but she's forgotten about the chick she nearly killed for him. So that's my dream. That and some stuff about cigars and a tunnel. But tell me, college girl, what does it mean?"
Buffy,"To me? Mostly, that you still mouth off about things you don't understand. (Sirens) Uh-oh. I guess somebody knows you're here."
Faith,"You took my life, B. Payback's a bitch."
Willow,Look who's talking.
Faith,See you around.
Willow,Thanks for ocming with. Hunting for a psychopathic superbitch is definitely in the above and beyond category.
Tara,"It's okay, really. So, what do we do if we find her?"
Willow,"Run, flee, maybe skedadlle. We're not here to engage. This is strictly recon."
Willow,What?
Tara,"You said ""recon"". You're like ""Cool Monster Fighter""!"
Willow,"Well, technically, Faith isn't a monster. And as far as fighting, I'd be lucky to bruise her fist with my face."
Tara,Oh.
Willow,What?
Tara,"Face-punching, I'm not so good with the whole..(Imitates throwing punches rather badly)"
Willow,Swimming?
Tara,Violence.
Willow,"Don't worry, we're sure to spot Faith first. She's liek this cleavagy slut-bomb walking around ""Ooh, check me out, I'm wicked-cool, I'm five-by-five."""
Tara,Five-by-five? Five what by five what?
Willow,"See, that's the thing. No-one knows. Buffy can handle Faith and you're plenty safe with me."
Tara,"So, um.......we recon till nightfall?"
Willow,Then the ritual hiding begins.
Xander,"The point being I could be the target here. Faith finds Mr. Xander Harri still in town, she goes tighter than cat gut. Got a lotta pent up feelings there. I'm only saying."
Giles,"(Wearily) Yes, I'm sure."
Xander,"See, I can't be held responsible for the effect I have on women."
Giles,No...
Xander,"See, Faith and I have this little thing between us called history..."
Xander,Spike?
Giles,What are you doing here?
Spike,"Me? Hey, I'm not the one out of place here."
Xander,"For your information, smarty, we've got a rogue Slayer on our hands. Real psycho-killer too."
Spike,Sounds serious.
Giles,It is. What do you know?
Spike,What do you need?
Xander,"Her. Dark hair. Yay (Indicates) tall, name of Faith, criminally insane."
Giles,Have you seen her?
Spike,Is this bird after you?
Xander,"In a bad way, yeah."
Spike,"Tell you what I'll do then. I'll head out, find this girl, tell her exactly where you are and then watch as she kills you. (Sees their looks of surprise and irriatation.) Can't any one of your damn little Scooby club at least try to remember that I hate you all? Just because I can't do the damage myself doesn't stop me from aiming a loose cannon your way. And here I thought the evening be dull."
Xander,Go ahead. You wouldn't even recognise her.
Spike,"Dark hair, this tall (Indicates), anme of Faith, criminally insane. Like this girl already."
Xander,We're dumb.
Monster,Faith! Your friend sent me. I got a little rememberance from him.
Mayor,"Hello Faith. If you're watching this tape, it can only mean one thing. I'm dead. And our noble campaign to bring order to the town of Sunnydale has failed. Utterly and completely. But on the other hand, heck, maybe we won. And right now, I'm on some jumbo monder in the Richard Wilkins surrounded by a bunch of kids sitting Indian style and looking up at my face filled with fear and wonder. (Laughs) ""Hi kids!"" (Faith smiles) But the realist in me tends to doubt it. Now, Faith, as I record this message you're sleeping. And the doctors tell me you might never wake up. I don't believe that. Sooner or later you will wake up, and when you do, you'll find the world has gone and changed on you. I wish I could make the world a better place for you to wake up in. But, tough as it is to accept, we both have to understand that even my power to protect and watch over you has it's limits. See, the hard pill to swallow is that once I'm gone, your days are just plain numbered. Now, I know, you're a smart and capable young woman in charge of her own life, but the problem, Faith, is that there won't be a place in the world for you anymore. By now I bet you're feeling very much alone. But you're never alone. You'll always have me. (Picks up box) And you'll always have this. Go ahead. Open the box. (Faith takes box from the case and looks at it.) Don't worry. It's not gonna bite. That's my job. (Laughs) Go ahead. Open it. (She does so) Surprise! You won't find these in any gumball machine! See, when you've been around as long as I have, you amke friends. And some of them forge neat little gizmos. Just like the one you're holding right now. (She looks at it) And here's the good news. Just because it's over for my Faith, doesn't mean she can't go out with a bang. (He looks down and laughs sadly. Faith looks sadly at the device.)"
Riley,"Okay, I get it. Faith bad. Do I look like I'm arguing?"
Buffy,Not yet. But you always make that innocent face right before you start.
Riley,"Figured it out, huh? Damn. It took my mom twelve years to catch that one. All I'm saying is, if you're in trouble, I wanna help."
Buffy,You can't.
Riley,Give me one reason why.
Buffy,That's one.
Riley,"Alright, I'm not exactly action guy, but there's gotta be something I can do other than sit around waiting for you to pummel this gal."
Buffy,"Riley, the fact that you just called Faith a ""gal"" only proves that you don't know her."
Riley,Never seen anyone get under your skin this way before. What exactly did she do to you?
Buffy,It's a long story.
Riley,I'm from Iowa. We drive four hours for our High School football game. Try me.
Buffy,"I told you, okay? She hurt me and people I care about. And did I mention the psycho killer part?"
Riley,There's something you're not telling me.
Buffy,"Riley, I have to go. She's out there."
Riley,Alright. I'm just saying. I think you're holding out on me.
Buffy,"Riley, this isn't a joke. There's a criminally insane woman out there with super-powers who thinks I'm responsible for ruining her life. I know Faith. She'll come after me and she'll come after the people I love."
Faith,Hi Joyce.
Faith,Mind if I come in.
Faith,"Ruby sunset....burgendy skyline...harlot. Mmmmmmm, way to go Joyce. Now, normally I wouldn't be going for something this dark. But I read in some magazine that eight months in a coma will damage a girl's natural skin tone. (Puts on lipstick) Good thing pale is in this year.n Or was it last year? (Finishes, kisses mirror.) Anyway, for real now. I wanna ask you something, and I want you to promise to be honest, and to not spare my feelings just because I could kill you. You promise?"
Joyce,I promise.
Faith,OK. (Finishes with hair) How do I look? (Poses)
Joyce,Psychotic.
Faith,"Mmmmmmm. I was shooting for sultry, but hey. Bet I know what you're thinking."
Joyce,Really.
Faith,"You're thinking ""You'll never get away with this!"" Moi?"
Joyce,"Actually I was thinking ""My daughter is going to kill you soon."""
Faith,That a fact?
Joyce,More like a bet.
Faith,"Whoa. You got a pair on you, Joyce, I like seeing that in a woman your age. Guess you can afford to talk that way. I mean, in the world according to Joyce, Buffy is gonna come crashing through that door any minute. But, look what I found. (Goes over and picks up some letters, comes over to Joyce. Reads adresses.) Buffy Summers, Buffy Summers, Buffy Summers, Buffy, Buffy, Buffy. Lotta letters. She hasn't been by in a while, huh? And you'd think, with a crazy chick like me on the loose, crazy chick with a wicked grudge against her no less, she'd call, give you a heads up. But Buffy's too into her own deal to remember dear old mom."
Joyce,You don't know the first thing about Buffy. Or me.
Faith,"Don't I? I know what it's like. You think you matter, you think you're a part of something and you get dumped. It's like the whole world is moving and you're stuck. It's like those animals in the tar pits. It's like you just keep sinking a little deeper everyday and no-one even sees."
Joyce,Were you planning to slit my throat any time soon?
Faith,"Don't tell me you don't see it Joyce. You've served you purpose, squirted out the kids, raised her up, and now you might as well be dead. Nobody cares, nobody remembers, especially not Buffy fabulous superhero. Sooner or later you're going to have to face it. She was over us a long time ago Joyce. Too busy climbing onto her new boytoy to give a single though to the people that matter. I mean, you're her mother, and she just leaves you hear to die. (Grabs knife)"
Buffy,Hi mom.
Joyce,Hi honey.
Faith,Thought I'd go after the queen marine didn't ya? He's a cutie. Looks like he could use a good roll in the sack.
Buffy,You're not his type. He's not big on sleaze.
Faith,He's probably just never tried it.
Buffy,Going for the boyfriend again? That's tired.
Faith,Just something to remember me by once I've moved on.
Buffy,"Ever occur to you, Faith, that the reason we forgot you is because we wanted to?"
Guy,Hello Rupert.
Joyce,You okay?
Buffy,All things considered.
Joyce,(Sees Mayor's device) What is that?
Buffy,"Weapon of some kind. (Crushes it underfoot) Didn't work, whatever it was."
Joyce,"Oh, the Police."
Buffy,She's their problem now.
Joyce,You sure you're okay?
Buffy,Five-by-five.

Buffy,"(smoothing the edges) They smell good, don't they?"
Faith,What?
Buffy,(smiling) Clean sheets.  Like summer.
Faith,I wouldn't know.
Buffy,(stops smiling) Right.  I forgot.
Faith,I noticed.
Buffy,"(hesitantly) I-I wish I could stay, but . . ."
Faith,"Oh, you have to go."
Buffy,It's just with . . .
Faith,(knowingly) Little sis coming.  I know.  So much to do before she gets here.
Buffy,(regretfully) Now I really have to--
Faith,So go.  Don't let me keep--
Faith,(looks at Buffy) Damn.  Just when we made it so nice.
Faith,(concerned) Are you ever gonna take this thing out?
Xander,So.  Here it is.  The latest in state-of-the-art combat technology.  I gotta say it doesn't look that complicated.
Buffy,So can you repair it?
Xander,Sure.  Just as soon as I get my masters degree in advance starship technology.
Willow,"Well, why don't we experiment? (eagerly) Press some buttons, see what happens."
Giles,"(folding a pair of boxers) Uh, I-I'd like to veto that."
Xander,"Second.  It's called a blaster, Will.  A word that tends to discourage experimentation.  Now if it were called the orgasminator I'd be the first to try you basic button-press approach."
Buffy,"Just tell me, can you repair it or not."
Xander,I'm working on it.  I'm working on it.
Xander,But if I blow a hole in my mom's azalea patch the neighbors will not be pleased.
Giles,You all right? (he moves to sit closer to her) You've been patrolling around the clock for three days straight.  Perhaps you can use some--
Buffy,"(lifts her head) What?  Some rest?  There's a demonoid killing machine out there, Giles, that doesn't really work the night shift."
Giles,"I was going to say, perhaps you could use some back-up, but, um . . . now you mention it.  Gathering your strength might not be a bad idea."
Buffy,(to Xander) Just get the blaster working.  That's all the strength I need.
Willow,Are you sure?
Buffy,"Why, because rayguns aren't in the Slayer Handbook?  Will, you haven't seen this Adam thing.  H-he's the Terminator without the bashful charm.  And he's deadly.  And the last time we met he kicked my ass."
Willow,"Oh-- no!  Blast away, by all means.  I only meant . . . No word about Riley? (sits down in a chair next to the sofa)"
Buffy,"(sits back, crossing her arms) They keep telling me that he's fine.  That's all they'll say."
Willow,Maybe they're telling the truth?
Buffy,"(worried) Maybe.  I don't even know what the Initiative's version of fine is.  They could be forcing him back onto medication and torturing him, for all I know."
Giles,From what we've seen I doubt they'll be trying to hurt him.
Buffy,"The only thing I know for certain is that my boyfriend is locked away, and I'm not helping."
Willow,"(unaware of this) Maybe Giles has a point?  I mean, Riley is their Top Gun guy.  Doesn't make sense that they'd hurt him."
Buffy,The Initiative has all those brainwashy behavior modification guys.
Willow,So?
Buffy,So what happens when they start not liking his behavior?
Riley,"Stand down, soldier."
Riley,(conversationally) Stand down before I put you down.
Forrest,(to soldier) You heard the man.  At ease.
Forrest,"The shish kebab that walks like a man.  Looks like you're feeling better, walking around, threatening people, and all that."
Riley,Man was in my way.  I got places to be.
Forrest,Really?  And where were you thinking of going?
Riley,You know where I'm going.
Forrest,(exasperated sigh) Don't even tell me you're heading toward that girlfriend of yours. (steps out in front of him) Look at you. One good conjugal visit and you're back in intensive care to stay.
Riley,You wouldn't understand.
Forrest,"(crossing his arms) How bout you explain it to me, then?"
Graham,"We all friends here, fellas?"
Forrest,(looking at Riley) Absolutely.  Riley here is about to explain why he's leaving us so very quickly.
Riley,I don't explain.  Because I don't have to.  I'm the one in charge.
Forrest,Things change.
Riley,Do they?
Forrest,"Hey!  In case you failed to notice, we're in a world of hurt around here.  Now's the time for us to band together.  Not go flying off our separate ways."
Graham,"Forrest has a point, Riley."
Forrest,"We have a problem, we deal with that problem.  You know the most important part of the equation now is that we keep said problem within the family."
Riley,Family?  Is that what we are? (a beat) Step aside.
Faith,(VO) Do you think it's gonna rain?
Wilkins,Nonsense.  It's a beautiful day.  Now eat your sandwich. (wipes his mouth with a napkin)
Faith,I don't know.  It's just . . . it always seems like it starts raining right about now. (eats a grape)
Wilkins,You're too young and too pretty a girl to start wearing worry lines on your face.
Wilkins,"Well, hey, hey hey."
Wilkins,"Hey there, little fella.  Heh.  I don't know where you belong, but it's not here with us. (chuckles as he sets it down pointing towards the grass) There you go. (to Faith) You see?  There's nothing that's gonna spoil our time together.  Who wants cheesecake? (light laugh)"
Faith,NO!
Buffy,I told you I had things to do.
Willow,Spread out?
Buffy,Not too far.
Xander,So not a problem.
Buffy,I've never seen anything like that.
Xander,And I can go a long healthy stretch without seeing anything like that again.
Willow,It had to be Adam who killed it.  But why?
Buffy,"(faces her) He's studying biology.  Human, demon-- whatever he can get his hands on and tear apart."
Willow,Wondering what makes things work.
Xander,I really don't want to around for the final exam.
Buffy,It's not coming to that.  The Initiative created this thing and they can't stop it.  But we will.
Xander,Question.  Will hiding in a cabin with stockpiled chocolate goods be any part of this plan?
Buffy,No. (resumes pacing)
Xander,(to Willow) Told you.
Willow,(to Buffy) What's first?
Buffy,"Riley.  I'm not leaving him down there with the people that created this thing.  I don't care how many guns they have, I'm going in. (sits down on the edge of the recliner) Okay.  Will, I need you to hack into the security mainframe and buy me a ten minute shut-down of operation systems."
Willow,That could be--
Buffy,"--tricky.  Not impossible.  If you can't do it on-line then use magic.  Xander, any gear you've been saving for a rainy day, I want you to give it to me."
Xander,You want stealthy stuff?
Buffy,"No, we tried sneaking in.  This time I'm gonna use force.  I figure I'll go in through the elevator shaft and use the cable as tow lines.  Then blast open the facility doors and find the infirmary."
Riley,(grinning) Am I really worth all that?
Buffy,Riley!!
Riley,OH!
Buffy,"(pulling away) Ooo!  God, I'm sorry!  Did I hurt you?"
Riley,No.  A giant skewer through the ribcage hurt me. (taking her hands) That was just a reminder.
Buffy,(shaking her head in disbelief) How did you get out?
Riley,I walked.
Willow,They didn't try to stop you?
Riley,"Oh, they did.  Repeatedly. (holding Buffy's hand they step closer to the others) But, uh, then I told them they couldn't keep me without a major asskicking.  One way or another.  Here I am."
Xander,"(clasps hands loudly) That's.  Great.  Riley. (gets up to stand in front of him) And, you know, there's no polite way to ask you this, but . . . uhhh . . Did they put a chip in your brain? (staring at Riley's head)"
Riley,(frowns) Beg your pardon.
Buffy,Forget it.  We're just happy to have you back.
Willow,"(grinning) Yeah.  We were pretty worried about you there for awhile, mister."
Riley,"Me too.  Hey-- Look, I know my behavior was pretty out there."
Willow,"Forget it.  Tell you what.  You two crazy kids take down an unstoppable killer cyborg-demon-hybrid thingy and, uh, we'll call it all even."
Riley,Taking down Adam is gonna be tough.  There's no way to predict what he'll throw at us.
Buffy,"(happy) You're here.  Whatever comes, we can handle."
Faith,(soflty) Ouch.
Faith,"Uh, um . . . What?"
Faith,Graduation.
Faith,(sternly) Graduation.  I gotta get to Sunnydale High School graduation *now.*
Faith,(a beat) What day is it?
Faith,What . . . date?  The date?
Faith,(pause) What year?
Faith,(raising voice) What happened to the school?
Faith,Just . . . tell me.
Buffy,"(VO) You know, I never stopped thinking about you."
Riley,Me neither.  All I had in there was (he reaches into his back pocket and pulls out her red scarf) . . . this one little part of you.
Buffy,"It's just the scarf part of me, really."
Riley,I'm serious. (turns and paces the room) Just knowing you were out there.  That you cared.
Riley,Do you think we're being watched?
Buffy,I don't know.  Does the Initiative do that?
Riley,(looking out the window) Maybe.
Buffy,You seem a little . . . somewhere else. (takes his hand) Is there anything I can do?
Riley,"(sighs) Give me an order.  It's what I do, isn't it?  Follow orders?"
Buffy,You don't have to.
Riley,Don't I?  All my life that's what I've been groomed to do.
Buffy,I know how you feel.  Giles used to be a part of this council. And for years all they ever did was give me orders.
Riley,Ever obey them?
Buffy,"Sure. (a beat) The ones I was going to do anyway.  The point is, I quit the council.  And I was scared.  But it's okay now."
Riley,See.  Now that's where you and I are different.  I just suck at the whole gray-area thing.
Buffy,It's a choice.  Go back in there and maybe make some changes from the inside.  Or you can quit the team.  Fight demons in your own way.
Riley,You make it sound so simple.  I don't even know what my way is.
Buffy,"Well, it's time to find out."
Riley,"I'm a soldier.  Take that away, what's left?"
Buffy,(smiles) A good man.
Riley,What are you doing?
Buffy,I . . . am looking for brainwashy chips in your head.
Riley,(laughs) Finding any?
Buffy,"Hmmm, not sure. (looks into his eyes) But I should keep looking, just in case.  You've been strong long enough, Riley Finn.  I am gonna help you.  And we're gonna find this demon. And we're gonna kill it together.  (she actually makes this sound more romantic than it reads) And in the meantime you are gonna stop torturing yourself."
Riley,Sure about that?
Buffy,It's an order.
Doctor,So what do you mean she just wasn't there?
Nurse,I don't know.  I came to check the monitors like I always do at eight o'clock.  Eight o'clock is my shift.  I got here on time--
Detective,You found the bed in this condition?
Nurse,Haven't touched a thing.
Doctor,Get the duty rosters and check the log.  I want to know exactly what happened.  Coma patients do not just get up and walk xway.
Nurse,We are checking every room on every floor.
Detective,(to the doctor) Walk me through this one more time.  You knew this woman was wanted for questioning in a series of murders. There's no security on this wing?
Doctor,You don't understand.  There's no way that girl was gonna wake up.
Orderly,(OS) Doctor!
Doctor,This can't be happening.
Nurse,(to the orderly) Did you find her?
Orderly,Another woman.  Unconscious and badly beaten.  And she's been stripped.
Nurse,(into the phone) It's happened.  Send the team.
Giles,"(inside) The puzzle, it seems to me, is why Adam has stayed dormant as long as he has?"
Willow,(inside) When he's not making performance art out of other demons that is.
Riley,He's probably working off an autonomic power source.  Because he's straight out of the box he needs to charge up awhile.
Buffy,Okay.  What's he charging up for?
Xander,"Based on the clues, I'll go with killing spree."
Riley,And that's a best-case scenario.  I suppose a little fire power would be a good idea right now.
Xander,(surprised) Hey!  How'd you do that? (he hurries around the table and grabs the weapon out of his hands and tries to find the switch) Is there like an on/off button somewhere in here?
Riley,Blasters are easy.  Adam won't be.
Willow,"Since Professor Walsh designed it, any chance she left instructions lying around somewhere?"
Buffy,"Well, if she did, they're going to be in the Initiative."
Giles,(pouring) Which we can't get into without mounting a major offensive.
Riley,Speak for yourself. (everybody looks at him) (a beat) I'm just saying.
Giles,"I must admit, a man on the inside would be, uh . . ."
Buffy,A really good idea.  Are you sure you want to be double-agent guy?
Riley,I'm not exactly sure what you'd call me but . . I will share information.  It's the least I could do.
Xander,Riley's right.  It is the least he can do.
Giles,"Hello.  Y-yes, she is. (holds the phone towards Buffy) Uh, it's for you."
Buffy,Hello.  Speaking.  What sort of emergency?
Buffy,"Um . . . no, I haven't."
Buffy,Thank you.  I'll let you know.
Giles,What is it?
Buffy,"It's Faith.  She's awake. (turns to face them) She beat someone up, took her clothing, and disappeared out of the hospital.  No one knows where she is."
Xander,I'd say this qualifies for a worse timing ever award.
Willow,What do we do?
Giles,"Well, we have to find her."
Willow,What about Adam?
Xander,I'd hate to see the pursuit of a homicidal lunatic get in the way of pursuing a homicidal lunatic.
Buffy,"Well, Faith's not exactly low-profile girl.  I'll patrol and wait for her to make a move."
Giles,And then what?
Willow,Oh!  I have an idea.  Beat the crap out of her. (grins)
Xander,Good plan!
Buffy,Good on paper.  But we still have a decision to make.  Do we hand her over to the cops?  They wouldn't know what to do with a Slayer even if they knew we existed.
Willow,What about the Council?
Xander,"Been there.  Tried that.  Not unlike smothering a forest fire with napalm, as I recall."
Giles,"Well, the Initiative, they do have containment facilities."
Xander,One word.  Evil.
Buffy,"There's no way around it.  Faith is back and, whether I like it or not . . . she's my responsibility."
Willow,"Yeah, too bad.  That was funnest coma ever."
Buffy,We have no idea where she is.  We don't know what she's
Xander,(spiteful) Who she's doing.
Buffy,She could be terrified.  Maybe she doesn't even remember?
Giles,"Uh, perhaps there's some form of rehabilitation we just haven't"
Willow,And if not.  Asskicking makes a solid plan B.
Buffy,I'm not gonna rule it out.  First thing-- we need to find her.
Riley,(pause) Who's Faith?
Willow,What did you tell him?
Buffy,The truth.  That she's my wacky identical cousin from England
Willow,It's good you guys have such an honest relationship.
Buffy,"Nah, I told him the story.  I-I vagued up a few bits, but no"
Willow,That's fair.  How'd you handle the Angel-ly parts?
Buffy,I did some editing.  It's not that I'm trying to hide anything
Willow,Any luck?
Buffy,Couldn't find her.  Don't know exactly where to place that in
Willow,At least you're not alone on this.  I bet every cop in
Buffy,"Pressure is definitely high.  I tell you, if I were her I'd get"
Faith,(stoic) You're not me.
Faith,"(smiling) So.  Check you out, B.  Nice.  The big girl on campus"
Buffy,(cautiously) I've been looking for you.
Faith,"(still smiling) I've been standing still for eight months, B."
Buffy,Are you all right?
Faith,"Five by five.  Best thing about a coma, you wake up all rested"
Buffy,"(tensely) So much for pleasantries, huh?"
Faith,(smile becomes dangerous) What'd you think?  I'd wake up and
Buffy,You'd have done the same to me if you had the chance?
Faith,(gamely) So let's have another go at it.  See who lands on top.
Buffy,"It doesn't have to be like this, you know?"
Faith,"Actually, I think it has to be exactly like this."
Buffy,"(indicating the people around them) Faith, these are innocent"
Faith,(looking around) No such animal.
Buffy,(crosses her arms) I guess it was too much to hope that you'd
Faith,"Could say the same about you.  I mean, you're still the same"
Buffy,You had it coming.
Faith,"That's one interpretation.  But in my dream, she does it for a"
Faith,I wake up to find that this blonde chick isn't even dating the
Buffy,To me?  Mostly. (pissed) That you still mouth off about things
Buffy,Uh-oh.  I guess somebody knows you're here.
Faith,"You took my life, B.  Payback's a bitch!"
Willow,Look who's talking.
Faith,See ya around.
Willow,"Thanks, for coming with.  Hunting for a psychopathic super"
Tara,It's okay.  Really.
Tara,"So, uh, what do we do if we find her?"
Willow,Run.  Flee.  Maybe skedaddle.  We're not here to engage.  This
Tara,"You said recon. You're, like, cool monster fighter."
Willow,"Well, technically, Faith isn't a monster.  And as far as"
Tara,(worried) Oh.
Willow,What?
Tara,Face punching.  I'm not so good with the whole-- (throws cat-paw
Willow,Swimming?
Tara,Violence.
Willow,"Don't worry, we're sure to spot Faith first.  She's like this"
Tara,Five by five?  Five what by five what?
Willow,"See, that's the thing.  No one knows.  Buffy can handle Faith"
Tara,"(hopefully) So, umm, we recon until nightfall?"
Willow,(nods) Then the ritual hiding begins.
Tara,(worried again) Oh.
Xander,"The point being, I can be the target here.  Faith finds"
Giles,"(not really interested) Yes, I'm sure."
Xander,"See, I can't be held responsible for the effect I have on"
Giles,(half-heartedly) No.
Xander,"You see, Faith and I have this little thing between us called"
Xander,(lowering the blaster) Spike.
Giles,What are you doing here?
Spike,Me?  I'm not the one out of place here.
Xander,"For your information, smarty, we've got a rogue Slayer on our"
Spike,(concerned) Sounds serious.
Giles,It is.  What do you know?
Spike,(helpfully) What do you need?
Xander,"Her.  Dark hair, yea tall.  Name of Faith.  Criminally insane."
Giles,Have you seen her?
Spike,Is this bird after you?
Xander,In a bad way.  Yeah.
Spike,"Tell you what I'll do then.  Head out, find this girl, tell her"
Spike,Can anyone of your damn little Scooby club at least try to
Xander,(calling after him) Go ahead!  You wouldn't even recognize
Spike,"(faces them, still walking backwards) Dark hair, this tall,"
Xander,We're dumb.
Demon,Faith!
Demon,A friend sent me.  I got a little remembrance from him--
Wilkins,"(OS) Hello, Faith.  If you're watching this tape, it can only"
Wilkins,And our noble campaign to bring order to the town of
Wilkins,"But the realist in me tends to doubt it.  Now, Faith, as I"
Wilkins,"Now I know, I know you're a--you're a smart and capable young"
Wilkins,. . . you'll always have this. (chuckles) Go ahead.  Open the
Wilkins,Don't worry.  It's not gonna bite.  That's my job. (laughs)
Wilkins,Go ahead!  Open it!
Wilkins,"Surprise!  See, you don't get these in any gumball machine."
Wilkins,And here's the good news-- just because it's over for my
Buffy,She's a very dangerous woman.
Riley,"(grinning) Okay, I get it.  Really.  Faith bad.  Do I look like"
Buffy,Not yet. (picks up one of his Nerf basketballs from his desk)
Riley,"(smiling) Figured that out, huh?  Heh.  Damn.  Took Mom twelve"
Buffy,You can't.
Riley,Give me one reason why?
Buffy,That's one.
Riley,"Okay.  I'm not exactly action guy.  But-- I mean, there's got"
Buffy,"Riley, the fact that you just called Faith a gal only proves"
Riley,I've never seen anybody get under your skin this way before.
Buffy,(pauses) It's a long story. (starts pacing)
Riley,I'm from Iowa.  We drive four hours for a high school football
Buffy,I told you.  Okay?  She hurt me and people that I care about.
Riley,There's something you're not telling me.
Buffy,"Riley, I have to go.  She's out there."
Riley,All right.  I'm just saying. (gets up and catches her as she's
Buffy,"Riley, this isn't a joke. (sits him down on the bed) Okay,"
Buffy,I know Faith.  She'll come after me and she'll come after the
Faith,"(smiling) Hi, Joyce."
Faith,Mind if I come in?
Faith,"Tsk, tsk.  Ruby Sunset. (drops it) Burgundy Skyline. (drops it)"
Faith,"Now normally I wouldn't be going with a color this dark, but I"
Faith,"Anyway.  For real, now."
Faith,I'm gonna ask you something and you got to promise you'll be
Joyce,I promise.
Faith,Okay.  How do I look?
Joyce,(pause) Psychotic.
Faith,"Hmm.  I was shooting for sultry, but hey.  Bet I know what"
Joyce,Really?
Faith,You're thinking . . . (dramatically exaggerated voice) You'll
Joyce,"Actually, I was thinking my daughter is going to kill you soon."
Faith,Is that a fact?
Joyce,More like a bet.
Faith,"(smiling) Whoa.  You got a pair on you, Joyce.  I like seeing"
Faith,But . . . look what I found.
Faith,Buffy Summers.  Buffy Summers.  Buffy Summers.  Buffy.
Joyce,You don't know the first thing about Buffy.  Or me.
Faith,Don't I?  I know what it's like.  You think you matter.  You
Joyce,(sounding bored) Were you planning to slit my throat anytime
Faith,"Don't tell me you don't see it, Joyce.  You served your"
Buffy,"(to Joyce) Hi, Mom."
Joyce,"(relieved) Hi, honey."
Faith,"(grinning) Thought I'd go after the clean marine, didn't ya?"
Buffy,You're not his type.  He's not real big on sleaze.
Faith,He's probably just never tried it.
Buffy,Going for the boyfriend again?  That's tired.
Faith,Just something to remember me by once I've moved on.
Buffy,Did it ever occur to you Faith that the reason we all forgot
Man,"(English accent) Hello, Rupert."
Faith,The cops.
Joyce,You okay?
Buffy,All things considered.
Joyce,What is that?
Buffy,Weapon of some kind.
Buffy,Didn't work whatever it was.
Joyce,"Ah, the police."
Buffy,She's their problem now.
Joyce,(nods) You're sure you're okay?
Buffy,Five by five.
