Darla,Are you sure this is a good idea?
Boy,"It's a great idea, now come on."
Darla,Do you go to school here?
Boy,I used to. On top of the gym it's so cool. You can see the whole town.
Darla,"I, I, I, I don't wanna go up there."
Boy,"Aw, you can't wait, huh?"
Darla,We're just gonna get in trouble.
Boy,"Yeah, you can count on it."
Darla,What was that?
Boy,What was what?
Darla,I heard a noise.
Boy,It's nothing!
Darla,"Uh, uh, maybe it's something."
Boy,Or maybe it's some *thing*!
Darla,That's not funny.
Boy,Hellooooo! (to Darla) There's nobody here.
Darla,Are you sure? (looks away)
Boy,"Yes, I'm sure."
Darla,Okay.
Wolf,Howl.
Joyce,(off camera) Buffy?
Buffy,"(sitting up) I'm up, Mom!"
Joyce,(off camera) Don't wanna be late for your first day!
Buffy,(to herself) No... Wouldn't want that.
Joyce,Okay!
Joyce,"Have a good time. I know you're gonna make friends right away, just think positive. (gives a thumbs up)"
Joyce,And honey?
Joyce,Try not to get kicked out?
Buffy,I promise.
Joyce,Okay.
Xander,"'Scuse me, comin' through, pardon me, 'scuse me, whoa! 'Scuse me, not sure how to stop! Please move, whoa, 'scuse me... (notices Buffy) Whoa."
Xander,God!
Xander,I'm Okay. I feel good.
Xander,(sees her) Willow! You're so very much the person that I wanted to see! (gets up)
Willow,"Oh, really?"
Xander,"Yeah. You know, I kinda had a problem with the math."
Willow,"Uh, which part?"
Xander,"The math. Can you help me out tonight, pleeeease, be my study buddy?"
Willow,"Well, what's in it for me?"
Xander,A shiny nickel!
Willow,Okay. Do you have 'Theories in Trig'? You should check it out.
Xander,Check it out?
Willow,From the library? Where the books live.
Xander,"Right, I'm there! See, I wanna change..."
Jesse,"Hey, hey!"
Xander,"Hey, Jesse, what's what?"
Jesse,New Girl!
Xander,"That's right, I saw her. Pretty much a hottie!"
Willow,I heard someone was transferring...
Xander,So tell!
Jesse,Tell what?
Xander,"What's the sitch, what do ya know about her?"
Jesse,New girl!
Xander,"Well, you're certainly a font of nothing!"
Buffy,Mr. Flutie--
Buffy,Bob--
Buffy,I know my transcripts are a little... colorful.
Buffy,Wasn't *that* bad!
Buffy,"(exhales) I did, I really did, but... You're not seeing the big picture here, I mean, that gym was full of vampi--asbestos."
Buffy,Oh! Sorry!
Girl,That's okay.
Buffy,(looks down at the mess) Oh...
Xander,Can I have you?
Xander,Duh... (chuckles) Can I help you?
Buffy,(smiles) Thanks.
Xander,"I don't know you, do I?"
Buffy,I'm Buffy. I'm new.
Xander,Xander. Is-is me. Hi. (smiles)
Buffy,"Um, thanks."
Xander,"Well, uh, maybe I'll see you around... maybe at school... since we... both... go there."
Buffy,Great! (they stand up) It was nice to meet you.
Xander,(unimpressed with himself) We both go to school. Very suave. Very not pathetic.
Xander,"Oh, hey! (picks it up) Hey, you forgot your... stake."
Teacher,It's estimated that about twenty-five million people died in that one four-year span. But the fun part of the Black Plague is that it originated in Europe how?
Teacher,"As an early form of germ warfare. If you'll look at the map on page sixty-three you can trace the spread of the disease into Rome, and then north..."
Buffy,(to Cordelia) Thanks.
Teacher,And this popular plague led to what social changes? Steve?
Cordelia,Hi! I'm Cordelia. (offers her hand)
Buffy,(accepts it) I'm Buffy.
Cordelia,If you're looking for a textbook of your very own there's probably a few in the library.
Buffy,"Oh, great, thanks. (they get up) Where would that be?"
Cordelia,"I'll show you, come on. (they start out of the classroom) So you're from Hemery, right? In L.A.?"
Buffy,"Uh, yeah."
Cordelia,"Oh, I would *kill* to live in L.A. That close to that many shoes?"
Cordelia,"Well, you'll be okay here. If you hang with me and mine, you'll be accepted in no time. Of course, we do have to test your coolness factor. You're from L.A., so you can skip the written, but let's see. Vamp nail polish?"
Buffy,"Um, over?"
Cordelia,So over. James Spader?
Buffy,He needs to call me!
Cordelia,Frappaccinos?
Buffy,"Trendy, but tasty."
Cordelia,John Tesh?
Buffy,The Devil.
Cordelia,"That was pretty much a gimme, but... you passed!"
Buffy,"Oh, goody!"
Cordelia,Willow! Nice dress! Good to know you've seen the softer side of Sears.
Willow,"Uh, oh, well, my mom picked it out."
Cordelia,No wonder you're such a guy magnet. Are you done?
Willow,Oh!
Cordelia,"You wanna fit in here, the first rule is: know your losers. Once you can identify them all by sight (glances after Willow) they're a lot easier to avoid."
Cordelia,And if you're not too swamped with catching up you should come by the Bronze tonight.
Buffy,The who?
Cordelia,"The Bronze. It's the only club worth going to around here. They let anybody in, but it's still the scene. It's in the bad part of town."
Buffy,Where's that? (stops outside the library doors)
Cordelia,"About a half a block from the good part of town. (laughing) We don't have a whole lot of town here. But, um, you should show!"
Buffy,"Well, I'll try. (looks toward the library) Uh, thanks."
Cordelia,"Good. So, um, I'll see you in gym, and you can tell me absolutely everything there is to know about you. (waves and goes)"
Buffy,"(waves back) Great! (to herself) Oh, that sounds like fun."
Buffy,Hello? (continues in) Is anybody here?
Buffy,Ooh! (exhales) Anybody's here!
Giles,Can I help you?
Buffy,"I was looking for some, well, books. I'm new."
Giles,Miss Summers?
Buffy,"Good call! Guess I'm the only new kid, huh?"
Giles,I'm Mr. Giles. The librarian. I was told you were coming.
Buffy,"Great! So, um, I'm gonna need 'Perspectives on 20th Century--'"
Giles,(interrupting) I know what you're after!
Buffy,That's not what I'm looking for.
Giles,Are you sure?
Buffy,I'm *way* sure.
Giles,(confused) My mistake.
Giles,"(straightening back up) So, what is it you said--"
Aphrodisia,The new kid? She seems kind of weird to me. What kind of name is Buffy?
Girl,"Hey, Aphrodisia!"
Aphrodisia,"Oh, Hey!"
Aura,"Well, the chatter in the caf is that she got kicked out, and that's why her mom had to get a new job."
Aphrodisia,Neg!
Aura,Pos! She was starting fights!
Aphrodisia,Neg-ly!
Aura,"(opening her locker) Well I heard from Blue, and she said that--"
Buffy,"Uh, Hi! Willow, right?"
Willow,"(looks up) Why? I-I mean, hi! Uh, did you want me to move?"
Buffy,"Why don't we start with, 'Hi, I'm Buffy,' and, uh, then let's segue directly into me asking you for a favor. (sits next to her) It doesn't involve moving, but it does involve hanging out with me for a while."
Willow,But aren't you hanging out with Cordelia?
Buffy,I can't do both?
Willow,Not legally.
Buffy,"(exhales) Look, I really wanna get by here--new school--and... Cordelia's been really nice... to me... anyway, but, um, I kinda have this burning desire not to flunk all my classes, and I heard a rumor that you were the person to talk to if I wanted to get caught up."
Willow,"Oh, I could *totally* help you out! Uh, if you have sixth period free we could meet in the library?"
Buffy,"Or not. Or we could meet someplace quieter. Louder. Uh, that place just kinda gives me the wiggins."
Willow,"Oh, it has that effect on most kids. I love it, though, it's a great collection, and the new librarian is really cool."
Buffy,He's new?
Willow,"Yeah, he just started. He was a curator at some British museum, or, or *The* British Museum, I'm not sure. But he knows everything, and he brought all these historical volumes and biographies, and am I the single dullest person alive?"
Buffy,Not at all.
Jesse,Hey!
Xander,You guys busy? Are we interrupting? We're interrupting.
Buffy,Hey!
Willow,Hey!
Jesse,Hey there!
Willow,"Buffy, this is Jesse and that's Xander."
Xander,"Oh, me and Buffy go waaay back, old friends, very close. Then there's that period of estrangement where I think we were both growing as people, but now here we are, like old times, I'm quite moved."
Jesse,"Is it me, or are you turning into a bibbling idiot?"
Xander,"No, it's, uh, it's not you."
Buffy,"Well, it's nice to meet you guys, I think."
Jesse,"Well, you know, we wanted to welcome ya, make ya feel at home, unless you have a scary home..."
Xander,And to return this. (holds up the stake) The only thing I can think is that you're building a really little fence. (hands it to her)
Buffy,"(takes it) Hah, no, um, a-a-actually it was for self-defense. Everyone has them in L.A. Pepper spray is just so pass√©."
Xander,"So what do you do for fun, what do you like, what do you look for in a man, let's hear it."
Jesse,"If you have any dark, painful secrets you'd like us to publish?"
Buffy,"Gee, everyone wants to know about me. How keen."
Xander,"Well, not much goes on in a one Starbucks town like Sunnydale. You're pretty big news."
Buffy,I'm not. Really.
Cordelia,(interrupts) Are these guys bothering you?
Buffy,"Uh, no!"
Willow,She's not hanging out with us.
Jesse,(stands next to her) Hey! Cordelia!
Cordelia,"(to Jesse) Oh, please! (to Buffy) I don't mean to interrupt your downward mobility, but I just wanted to tell you that you won't be meeting Coach Foster, the woman with the chest hair, because gym was canceled due to the *extreme* dead guy in the locker."
Buffy,What?
Willow,What are you talking about?
Cordelia,Some guy was stuffed in Aura's locker!
Buffy,Dead.
Cordelia,Totally dead. Way dead.
Xander,"It's not just a little dead, then?"
Cordelia,Don't you have an elsewhere to be?
Jesse,"Y'know, if you need a shoulder to cry on, or just to nibble on..."
Buffy,How did he die?
Cordelia,I don't know.
Buffy,"Well, were there any marks?"
Cordelia,Morbid much! I didn't ask!
Buffy,"(looks at everyone) Um, I gotta book. I'll, I'll see you guys later."
Cordelia,What's her deal?
Buffy,"Oh, great."
Buffy,"Okay, what's the sitch?"
Giles,(in the stacks) Sorry?
Buffy,"You heard about the dead guy, right? The dead guy in the locker?"
Giles,(steps into the light) Yes.
Buffy,"'Cause, it's the weirdest thing. He's got two little, little holes in his neck, and all his blood's been drained. (meets him) Isn't that bizarre? Aren't you just going, 'ooh'?"
Giles,I was afraid of this.
Buffy,"Well, *I* wasn't! It's my first day! I was afraid that I was gonna be behind in all my classes, that I wouldn't make any friends, that I would have last month's hair. I didn't think there'd be vampires on campus. And I don't care."
Giles,Then why are you here?
Buffy,"To tell you that... I don't care, which... I don't, and... have now told you, so... bye. (turns away to go)"
Giles,"Is he, w-will he... rise again?"
Buffy,(turns back) Who?
Giles,The boy.
Buffy,No. He's just dead.
Giles,Can you be sure?
Buffy,To make you a vampire they have to suck your blood. And then you have to suck their blood. It's like a whole big sucking thing. Mostly they're just gonna kill you. Why am I still talking to you?
Giles,"You really have no idea what's going on, do you? You think it's coincidence, your being here? That boy was just the beginning."
Buffy,"Oh, why can't you people just leave me alone?"
Giles,"Because you are the Slayer. (comes down the stairs) Into each generation a Slayer is born, one girl in all the world, a Chosen One, one born with the strength and skill to hunt--"
Buffy,"(interrupts and joins in) With the strength and skill to hunt the vampires, to stop the spread of their evil blah, blah, blah... I've heard it, okay?"
Giles,"I really don't understand this attitude. You, you've accepted your duty, you, you've slain vampires before..."
Buffy,"Yeah, and I've both been there and done that, and I'm moving on."
Giles,What do you know about this town? (goes into his office)
Buffy,It's two hours on the freeway from Neiman Marcus?
Giles,"Dig a bit in the history of this place. You'll find a, a steady stream of fairly odd occurrences. Now, I believe this whole area is a center of mystical energy, (comes back with four books) that things gravitate towards it that, that, that you might not find elsewhere. (sets them on the table)"
Buffy,Like vampires.
Giles,"Like zombies, werewolves, incubi, succubi, everything you've ever dreaded was under your bed, but told yourself couldn't be by the light of day. They're all real!"
Buffy,"What? You, like, sent away for the Time-Life series?"
Giles,"Ah, w-w-w-yes."
Buffy,Did you get the free phone?
Giles,"Um, the calendar."
Buffy,"Cool! But, okay, (gives back the books) first of all, I'm a Vampire Slayer. And secondly, I'm retired. Hey, I know! Why don't you kill 'em?"
Giles,"I-I'm a Watcher, I-I haven't the skill..."
Buffy,"Oh, come on, stake through the heart, a little sunlight... It's like falling off a log."
Giles,"A, a Slayer slays, a Watcher--"
Buffy,Watches?
Giles,"Yes. No! (sets down the books) He, he trains her, he, he, he  prepares her--"
Buffy,Prepares me for what? For getting kicked out of school? For losing all of my friends? For having to spend all of my time fighting for my life and never getting to tell anyone because I might endanger them? Go ahead! Prepare me.
Giles,(to himself) Damn!
Xander,What?
Giles,It's getting worse!
Buffy,What's getting worse?
Giles,"The influx of the undead, the... supernatural occurrences, it's been building for years. There's a reason why you're here and a reason why it's now!"
Buffy,Because now is the time my mom moved here.
Giles,"Something's coming, something, something... something is, is gonna happen here. Soon!"
Buffy,"Gee, can you vague that up for me?"
Giles,"The signs, as far as I can tell, point to a crucial mystical upheaval, very soon. Days. Possibly less."
Buffy,"Oh, come on! This is Sunnydale! How bad an evil can there be  here?"
Luke,"The sleeper will wake. The sleeper will wake. The sleeper will wake. The sleeper will wake, and the world will bleed. Amen!"
Buffy,Hi! I'm an enormous slut! (holds up a blue floral dress) Hello! Would you like a copy of 'The Watchtower'? (lowers the dress) I used to be so good at this.
Joyce,"Hi, hon."
Buffy,Hey!
Joyce,"Are you, uh, going out tonight?"
Buffy,"Yeah, I'm going to a club."
Joyce,Oh. Will there be boys there?
Buffy,"No, Mom. It's a nun club."
Joyce,"Well, just be careful."
Buffy,I will.
Joyce,"You know, I think we can make it work here. I've got my positive energy flowing... I'm gonna get the Gallery on its feet... Oh, uh, we may have found a space today."
Buffy,That's great.
Joyce,"Oh, and that school is a, a very nurturing environment, which is just what you need."
Buffy,"Well, actually..."
Joyce,"Oh, not too nurturing. I know, you're sixteen, I've read all about the dangers of over-nurturing."
Joyce,"It's hard. New town and everything... It is for me, too. I'm trying to make it work. (takes her daughter's hands in hers) I'm *going* to make it work."
Buffy,I know.
Joyce,"Oh, you're a good girl, Buffy, (pats her on the head) you just fell in with the wrong crowd. But that is all behind us now."
Buffy,"It is. From now on I am only going to hang out with the living. (they let go of their hands, and she picks up her dresses) I mean, lively. People."
Joyce,Hmm. Okay. You have fun.
Angel,"Ah, heh. Is there a problem, ma'am?"
Buffy,"Yeah, there's a problem. Why are you following me?"
Angel,"I know what you're thinking. Don't worry, I don't bite."
Angel,"Truth is, I thought you'd be taller, or bigger muscles and all that. You're pretty spry, though. (massages his neck)"
Buffy,What do you want?
Angel,The same thing you do.
Buffy,(lets down her guard) Okay. What do I want?
Angel,(steps toward her) To kill them. To kill them all.
Buffy,"Sorry, that's incorrect. But you do get this lovely watch and a year's supply of Turtle Wax. What I *want* is to be left alone!"
Angel,Do you really think that's an option anymore? You're standing at the Mouth of Hell. And it's about to open.
Angel,Don't turn your back on this. (tosses her the box) You've gotta be ready.
Buffy,What for?
Angel,For the Harvest.
Buffy,Who are you?
Angel,Let's just say... I'm a friend. (starts to leave)
Buffy,"Yeah, well, maybe I don't want a friend."
Angel,(turns back) I didn't say I was yours.
Lyrics,"<I>Oh, I just want to believe / Can you hear me? / Can you see me? / What's inside of me? / Oh, I just want to believe / If my life can have a purpose / Help me to believe / Oh, I just want to believe / Can you hear me? / Can you see me? / What's inside of me? / Oh, I just want to believe / If my life can have a purpose / Help me to believe</I>"
Lyrics,"<I>Everybody wants to find the circle / The line of truth that has no end / Because so many nights I've slept with the feeling of empty / And I say, right now I'm ready to believe</I>"
Buffy,Hey!
Willow,"Oh, hi!"
Willow,Hi!
Buffy,"Oh, you're here with someone?"
Willow,"No, I'm just here. I thought Xander was gonna show up."
Buffy,"Oh, are you guys going out?"
Willow,"No, we're just friends. We used to go out, but we broke up."
Buffy,How come?
Willow,"He stole my Barbie. (Buffy looks confused) Oh, we were five."
Buffy,Oh.
Willow,I-I-I don't actually date a whole lot... lately.
Buffy,Why not?
Willow,"Well, when I'm with a boy I like, it's hard for me to say anything cool, or, or witty, or at all. I-I can usually make a few vowel sounds, and then I have to go away."
Buffy,It's not *that* bad!
Willow,"No, i-it is. I think boys are more interested in a girl who can talk."
Buffy,You really *haven't* been dating lately.
Willow,It's probably easy for you.
Buffy,"Yeah, real easy."
Willow,I-I mean you don't seem too shy.
Buffy,"Well, my philosophy, do you wanna hear my philosophy?"
Willow,"Yeah, I do!"
Buffy,Life is short.
Willow,Life is short!
Buffy,"Not original, I'll grant you, but it's true. You know? Why waste time being all shy and worrying about some guy, and if he's gonna laugh at you. Seize the moment, 'cause tomorrow you might be dead."
Willow,"Oh, that's nice!"
Buffy,"Um, I'll be back in a minute. (gets up to go)"
Willow,"Oh, tha-that's okay, you don't have to come back."
Buffy,(smiles) I'll be back in a minute.
Willow,(to herself) Seize the moment.
Lyrics,"<I>I feel love with my friends / I feel love in my songs / If I could just hold love / Then all the answers might come / I said, oh, if we're all children of God / And we just turned away / I got a lack of belief / I said a world without faith / It's time we turn back around</I>"
Buffy,"(finds Giles) So, you like to party with the students. Isn't that kinda skanky?"
Giles,"Oh, right, this is me having fun. Watching... clown hair prance about is hardly my idea of a party. I'd much rather be at home with a cup of Bovril and a good book."
Buffy,"You need a personality, stat!"
Giles,"(points to the crowd below) This is a perfect breeding ground for vampire activity. It's dark, it's crowded... Besides, I knew you were likely to show up, and I have to make you understand--"
Buffy,"That the Harvest is coming. I know, your friend told me."
Giles,What did you say?
Buffy,The Harvest. That mean something to you? 'Cause I'm drawing a blank.
Giles,I'm not sure. Uh... W-who told you this?
Buffy,"This... guy. Dark, gorgeous in an annoying sort of way. I figured you two were buds."
Giles,No. The Harvest. Did he say anything else?
Buffy,Something about the Mouth of Hell. I *really* didn't like him!
Giles,"Look at them, throwing themselves about, completely unaware of the danger that surrounds them."
Buffy,Lucky them.
Giles,Or perhaps you're right. Perhaps there is no trouble coming; the signs could be wrong. It's not as though you've been having the nightmares.
Cordelia,"My mom doesn't even *get* out of bed anymore. And the doctor says it's Epstein-Barr. I'm like, pleeease! It's chronic hepatitis, or at least chronic fatigue syndrome. I mean, *nobody* cool has Epstein-Barr anymore."
Jesse,"Hey, Cordelia!"
Cordelia,"Oh, yay, it's my stalker. (makes a face)"
Jesse,"Hey, you, uh, you look great!"
Cordelia,"Well, I'm glad we had this little chat."
Jesse,"(coughs) Listen, uh, you know, you wanna dance, you know?"
Cordelia,With you?
Jesse,"Well, uh, yeah."
Cordelia,"Well, uh, no! C'mon, guys."
Jesse,"Fine! Plenty of other fish in the sea. Oh, yeah, I'm... on the prowl. Witness me prowling!"
Buffy,"I didn't say I'd never slay another vampire. It's not like I have all these fluffy-bunny feelings for them, I'm just not gonna get way extracurricular with it. You know, if I see one, sure I'll--"
Giles,"(interrupting) Will you be ready? There's so much you don't know about them, about your own powers. A vampire appears to be completely normal until the feed is upon them, only then do they reveal their true demonic visage."
Buffy,"You're like a textbook with arms, I know this."
Giles,"The point is, a Slayer should be able to see them anyway. Without looking, without thinking. Can you tell me if there's a vampire in this building?"
Buffy,Maybe...
Giles,"You should know. Even through this mass and this... din, you should be able to sense them. Well, try! Reach out with your mind. (Buffy looks around) You have to hone your senses, focus until the energy washes over you, until you, you feel every particle of-of--"
Buffy,There's one.
Giles,W-where?
Buffy,"Right there, talking to that girl."
Giles,You don't know--
Buffy,"Oh, please! Look at his jacket. He's got the sleeves rolled up, and the shirt! Deal with that outfit for a moment."
Giles,It's dated?
Buffy,"It's carbon dated. Trust me, only someone living underground for ten years would think that was still the look."
Giles,But you didn't... hone.
Buffy,"(notices that the girl is Willow) Oh, no."
Giles,Isn't that--
Buffy,Willow.
Giles,What's she doing?
Buffy,Seizing the moment!
Lyrics,<I>We're formed in liquid / Pushed out still dripping / A world was thrown before my eyes</I>
Lyrics,"<I>Now paint a picture / Crayon stick figures / With blue-haired people, purple skies</I>"
Buffy,(recognizing) Cordelia! (she lets go)
Cordelia,God! What is your childhood trauma?!
Buffy,Have you guys seen Willow? Did she come by here?
Cordelia,Why? Do you need to attack her with the stick? Jeez!
Cordelia,"(to her groupies) Excuse me, I have to call *everyone* I have *ever* met, right now."
Giles,That *was* quick. Well done! I-I need to go to the library. This Harvest thing...
Buffy,I didn't find them!
Giles,The vampire is not dead?
Buffy,"No, but my social life is on the critical list."
Giles,"(lets go of her) So, what do we do?"
Buffy,I'll take care of it!
Giles,"I-I-I need to come with you, yes?"
Buffy,Don't worry. One vampire I can handle.
Jesse,"So, um, what did you say your name was?"
Darla,Darla.
Jesse,"Darla. You know, I haven't seen you around before. Are you from around here?"
Darla,"No, but I have family here."
Jesse,Have I met them?
Darla,You probably will.
Luke,Master!
Master,I am weak.
Luke,"(quotes scripture) 'In the Harvest, he will be restored.'"
Master,The Harvest.
Luke,We're almost there. Soon you'll be free!
Master,I must be ready. I need my strength.
Luke,I've sent your servants to bring you some food.
Master,Good. Luke?
Luke,Yes?
Master,Bring me something... young.
Willow,Sure is dark.
Thomas,It's night.
Willow,"Well, that's a dark time, night. Traditionally. I still can't believe I've never seen you at school. Do you have Mr. Chomsky for history?"
Willow,"Uh, the ice cream bar is this way. It's past Hamilton Street?"
Thomas,I know a shortcut.
Xander,"Hey, you're leaving already?"
Buffy,"Oh, Xander! Have you seen Willow?"
Xander,"Not tonight, no."
Buffy,She left with a guy.
Xander,"We're talking about Willow, right? Scorin' at the Bronze, work it girl--"
Buffy,"(interrupts) No, I need to find her. Where would he take her?"
Xander,"Why? Oh, hey, I hope he's not a vampire, because then you might have to slay him."
Buffy,(taken aback) Was there a-a school bulletin? Was it i-in the newspaper? Is there anyone in this town who doesn't know I'm the Slayer?
Xander,"No. I only know that you *think* that you're the Slayer, and the reason why I know that--"
Buffy,"(interrupts) Well, whatever, it doesn't matter, just tell me, where would Willow go?"
Xander,You're serious!
Buffy,We don't find her and there's gonna be one more dead body in the morning!
Willow,"Oh, okay, th-this is nice... and scary. Are you sure this is faster?"
Thomas,Hey! Ever been in one of these?
Willow,No. Thank you. (turns away)
Thomas,Come on. (comes up behind her and pulls her hair back) What are you afraid of?
Willow,That wasn't funny!
Willow,I think I'm gonna go.
Thomas,Is that what you think?
Darla,Is this the best you could do?
Thomas,She's fresh!
Darla,Hardly enough to share.
Thomas,Why didn't you bring your own?
Darla,(gives him a look) I did.
Jesse,Hey! Wait up!
Willow,"Oh, my God, Jesse!"
Jesse,"Y'know, you gave me a hickey."
Darla,(shrugs) I got hungry on the way.
Willow,"Jesse, let's get outta here!"
Darla,"Oh, you're not going anywhere."
Willow,(confronts her) Leave us alone!
Darla,You're not going anywhere until we've (vamps out) *fed*!
Buffy,"Well, this is nice. I-it's a little bare, but a dash of paint, a few throw pillows... call it home!"
Darla,Who the hell are you?
Buffy,"You mean there's actually someone in this town who doesn't know already? Whew, that's a relief, I'm telling you! Having a secret identity in this town is a job of work."
Xander,"Buffy, we bail now, right?"
Thomas,Not yet!
Buffy,"Okay, first of all, what's with the outfit? Live in the now, okay? You look like DeBarge!"
Buffy,"Now, we can do this the hard way, or... well, actually there's just the hard way."
Darla,That's fine with me!
Buffy,"Are you sure? Now, this is not gonna be pretty. We're talking violence, strong language, adult content..."
Buffy,See what happens when you roughhouse?
Darla,He was young and stupid!
Buffy,"Xander, go!"
Darla,Don't go far!
Buffy,"You know, I just wanted to start over. Be like everybody else. Have some friends, y'know, maybe a dog... But, no, you had to come here, you couldn't go suck on some other town."
Darla,Who are you?
Buffy,Don't you know?
Luke,I don't care!
Luke,"You were supposed to be bringing an offering for the Master! We're almost at Harvest, and you dally with this child!"
Darla,"(fearfully) We had someone, but then she came. She killed Thomas. Luke, she's strong."
Luke,You go. I'll see if I can handle the little girl.
Luke,You're strong.
Luke,I'm stronger!
Willow,"We'll get the police, it's just a few blocks up!"
Luke,You're wasting my time.
Buffy,"Hey, I had other plans, too, okay?"
Luke,You think you can stop me? Stop us?
Luke,You have no idea what you're dealing with.
Luke,"'And like a plague of boils, the race of man covered the Earth.'"
Luke,'But on the third day of the newest light would come the Harvest. And the blood of men will flow as wine.'
Luke,'When the Master will walk among them once more.'
Luke,'The Earth will belong to the old ones.'
Luke,'And Hell itself will come to town.'
Luke,(smiling widely) Amen!
