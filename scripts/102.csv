GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
WATCHER,You are the chosen one.
WATCHER,You alone can stop them.
BUFFY,Who?
WATCHER,The vampires.
WATCHER,You see your power.
BUFFY,Why can't you people just leave me alone?
GILES,Into each generation a Slayer is born.
WILLOW,"You're the Slayer, and we're like the Slayerettes."
XANDER,"The three of us have been together from the beginning. We've always gone on patrols, and, uh, done demon research with her and everything."
BUFFY,We're talking about two very powerful witches (shot of Willow and Tara doing a spell) and a thousand-year-old ex-demon (shot of Anya)
XANDER,"Anya, you wanna marry me?"
BUFFY,Angel.
ANGEL,I love you.
BUFFY,So don't go.
SPIKE,Home sweet home.
DOCTOR,That chip was deeply imbedded in your cerebral cortex.
SPIKE,I can't bite anything. I can't even hit people.
GILES,What are you saying?
SPIKE,"Spike had a little trip to the vet, and now he doesn't chase the other puppies any more."
SPIKE,"I know you'll never love me. I know that I'm a monster, but you treat me like a man."
SPIKE,"They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the key to her in the form of a sister."
GREGOR,You were created to open the gates that separate dimensions.
GREGOR,The little girl. The key.
GREGOR,"Destroy it, and the will of the beast will be broken."
DAWN,No!
DAWN,I have to jump.
BUFFY,It'll kill you.
DAWN,Look at what's happening!
DAWN,"Buffy, no."
BUFFY,"Dawnie, I have to."
BUFFY VOICEOVER,You have to take care of each other. You have to be strong. Be brave. Live.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,For me.
TARA,"Willow, Xander!"
TARA,They're not here.
ANYA,"Thank god. (Tara looks confused) No, I mean, my store hasn't been looted."
TARA,Yet.
ANYA,(softly) Xander.
TARA,They're all right.
ANYA,Then where are they? Why aren't they here?
TARA,I don't know.
ANYA,"(getting agitated) They could be hurt. Xander could be lying somewhere broken and bleeding, calling out my name."
TARA,Anya.
ANYA,"Like that, oh god! (walks on) What if, what if they're really hurt, what if they're dead?"
TARA,(firmly) They're not.
ANYA,How do you know?
TARA,"Because he's with Willow. And if something ... happened, I'd know. (softly) And so would you."
ANYA,(calmer) You think?
TARA,I'm sure of it. (hugs her) They're fine.
TARA,(trying to convince herself) They're both fine.
TARA,"Maybe they got lost, in the woods."
ANYA,The woods? Are we going back to the woods? I hate the woods. All those woodsy trees.
TARA,"(excited) No, it's okay. Lost is good. Willow and I always know how to find each other!"
ANYA,With yoga?
TARA,"Ssh! (eyes closed) Aradia, hear my words."
XANDER,"Okay, this is really starting to grate my cheese. These woods aren't that big. Now, I know we've been going straight because I've been following the North Star."
WILLOW,(looks up) Xander. (they stop) That's not the North Star. It's an airplane.
XANDER,"Nah, that's not an airplane, it's definitely ... (looks harder) ...a blimp! (embarrassed) But I can see how one ... could make that airplane mistake."
WILLOW,"(panting) I, I can't walk any more. I need to rest."
XANDER,It can't be much further.
WILLOW,You said that an hour ago. I just ... that spell took a lot out of me.
XANDER,"As for example, snakes? How come you didn't tell us how much-"
WILLOW,No. Not now.
XANDER,"What were we into back there, Will?"
WILLOW,It doesn't matter anyway.
XANDER,Do not get all avoidy on me.
WILLOW,"I'm not avoidy, I just ... we have bigger problems. Demons?"
XANDER,Demons! Ah. There's something you don't see every day. (sarcastic chuckle) Unless you're us.
WILLOW,"(annoyed) Yeah, and now we're lost, so can we - (sees something ahead) What's that?"
XANDER,See? Avoidy.
WILLOW,"(points) Over there, that-that light."
XANDER,(looks) That one moving towards us?
XANDER,Incredibly fast?
WILLOW,(calls) Hello?
XANDER,"""Hello""? We're being hunted, and you're hello-ing a strange fast-moving light in the dark? It could be anything."
XANDER,It's a motorcycle headlight.
WILLOW,"(smiling) No, too small."
XANDER,"Stay behind me. (picks up a stick from the ground, moves forward)"
WILLOW,"Xander, I don't-"
XANDER,Stay down. I'll take care of this.
WILLOW,"Xander, it's-"
XANDER,A bug! A big fiery bug! (trying to shoo it away)
WILLOW,Xander-
XANDER,"Get off! Do fireflies bite? No, they probably burn, don't they? They - yaa!"
WILLOW,"(smiling) Xander, it's not a bug. (as it flies around her face) It's Tara."
WILLOW,Come on.
XANDER,And how long have you known that your girlfriend's Tinkerbell?
HOMEOWNER,What are you doing?
HOMEOWNER,Get away from there!
HOMEOWNER,Do you hear me? (walks onto the porch) I said get off my property!
HOMEOWNER,Leave us alone. (yells) Get outta here!
SPIKE,Get back.
DAWN,I-it looks like they're just ... wrecking stuff. No thought other than just destruct-o-rama.
DAWN,What?
SPIKE,"Uh, oh, nothing, just, uh ... (nods toward the action) looked like fun. (Dawn gives him a look) I'm just sayin'. Yeah, it's just ... (looks around) with this kind of frolicking going on all around town, we're not gonna get very far without..."
SPIKE,"Let's fly, pigeon!"
ANYA,"(calls) Already been looted, sorry! Uh, try the appliance store down the block, they've got great toasters."
XANDER,(OS) Anya!
ANYA,Xander?
ANYA,I knew you weren't dead. (hugs him)
XANDER,"Wow, then why was I so worried?"
TARA,(leading Willow to a chair) Are you-
WILLOW,"Uh, not yet. But, but I will be."
WILLOW,Where's Dawn and Spike?
TARA,"We've been calling the house, but-"
XANDER,"Maybe they're on their way here. I mean, this place is NORAD, and we are at DefCon One."
XANDER,"Okay, I so need male friends."
WILLOW,We have to go out and look for them. (tries to get up but Tara pushes her back down)
XANDER,"There's this guy at work I kind of hit it off with. Tito. I mean, he seems like a good..."
XANDER,"(embarrassed) You were talking about Dawn and Spike, of course."
ANYA,"Um, question. (to Willow) You want us to go back out there?"
WILLOW,"Well, yeah. Uh, unless somebody's got a better idea."
ANYA,"Well, um, it's just ... we're minus a Buffybot. And, uh, Spike is missing in action somewhere with Dawn, and Giles flew away, and, uh, well you, you're looking a little magicked-out."
XANDER,"Ahn honey, we're nearing your point, right?"
ANYA,"It's just, how are we supposed to fight these guys? (Everyone looks at her) I mean, we can take a vampire or two, sure, but there's a whole cavalcade of demons out there ... (uncertainly) I mean, I think this, you know ... it, it takes, um ... I mean, I ... we need..."
XANDER,Buffy.
ANYA,(softly) Buffy.
WILLOW,(harshly) Buffy...
WILLOW,...is not coming back. (sadly) We failed.
WILLOW,"So ... we're it, gang. (gets painfully to her feet) Xander, grab the weapons. We're gonna look for Dawn and Spike."
TARA,"If we're gonna go, we should go now, they're just getting more and more worked up by the moment."
XANDER,"Well, they can't keep it up forever. I mean, maybe they'll party themselves out, you know, tire of this place and move on."
RAZOR,"Say hello to your new home, boys."
RAZOR,"This here is a momentous occasion, the beginning of a new era."
RAZOR,"Now, no question, the open backroads and highways have been good to us. But we've got ourselves a juicy little burg here, just ripe for the picking. And I ain't in no hurry to leave it, you?"
RAZOR,"So I figure, what better way to kick off our ... semi-settling-down, than with a little christening?"
RAZOR,A symbolic act commemorating the new order around here ... and ridding ourselves of any not-so-pleasant reminders of the old.
RAZOR,"All in one quick, really, *really* violent fell swoop."
RAZOR,"(holds up the gun) Gentlemen, start your engines."
RAZOR,"Bye-bye, slayer!"
BUFFY,(screams) No!
RAZOR,"(looking at Buffy) Another one for the fire, boys."
RAZOR,Tear it up.
DEMON,Sorry. Sorry.
TARA,"It wasn't your fault. We, we don't know if the spell would have worked, even if the demons hadn't-"
WILLOW,It would have worked.
TARA,Well ... maybe...
WILLOW,What?
TARA,"Maybe it wasn't supposed to. I mean, those demons showing up at the exact wrong time? Maybe we really were in over our heads. Invoking forces that we have no right to. Maybe the fates sent down all that destruction on us to stop us. I mean..."
WILLOW,"You mean, maybe it was my fault."
TARA,No. No.
ANYA,(softly to Xander) I'm not saying we announce it this second.
XANDER,(whispers) Anya!
ANYA,"Well, I think it would please them to know we're engaged. And I think Willow in particular could use a real morale-booster right now."
XANDER,Can we talk about this later?
ANYA,"Well, but it's just all the excuses for not telling everyone we're engaged are gone now. I mean, aside from hell bikers, there's nothing standing in our way. This is it. No more surprises."
XANDER,Watch it!
ANYA,It ... it's the Buffy Bot.
XANDER,"Ah, peachy. No doubt to lead the wild bunch right to us again. Hey Will, next time this thing's damaged, couldn't ya program it to find the nearest Radio Shack, or..."
WILLOW,Buffy?
WILLOW,Buffy!
XANDER,Buffy!
WILLOW,Buffy!
ANYA,Where is she?
WILLOW,"Buffy? (moves toward her) Buffy, are you..."
WILLOW,It's Willow. Can you hear me?
ANYA,(whispers) What's wrong with her?
WILLOW,Nothing! She - she's ... she's in shock.
TARA,Her hands are bleeding. Her fingers.
ANYA,"(OS) Oh, she's filthy."
XANDER,Oh no.
WILLOW,(OS) What?
XANDER,No. How could we ... so stupid!
WILLOW,Xander!
XANDER,"Our spell. Our resurrection spell worked like a magic charm. We brought you back to life, Buffy. (looks at Willow) Right where we left her."
WILLOW,Oh god.
XANDER,In her coffin.
TARA,She had to ... dig out of her own grave.
XANDER,(muffled) Buffy.
XANDER,"(loudly) Buffy, it's Xander."
XANDER,(muffled) We're sorry. We didn't know.
XANDER,Buffy.
TARA,"You aren't reaching her, she's too traumatized."
ANYA,"Hey, Buffy. Uh, here's some good news that might perk you right up. Uh, Xander and I have an announcement."
XANDER,Anya!
ANYA,What? Just trying to help.
XANDER,Buffy .... it's gonna be all right. We brought you back. You're home now.
XANDER,"(muffled) Yeah, that's it. You're home."
RAZOR,"Yeah, welcome home, Slayer."
RAZOR,Alive and kickin' after all!
RAZOR,"Well, alive, anyway."
RAZOR,"(muffled) Not looking too good, though, is she?"
XANDER,(muffled) I don't see you winning too many beauty contests.
XANDER,"...unless the Miss ""My Face Fell Off"" pageant gets going."
RAZOR,Big axe you got there.
XANDER,"The better to cut you down to size, grandma."
TARA,Incindere.
RAZOR,Ah. So you got a witch in the mix.
TARA,More than one.
XANDER,I happen to be a very powerful man-witch myself. (Razor looks amused) Or ... male... (over his shoulder to Willow) Is it a warlock?
XANDER,Warlock.
ANYA,"Plus, we have a Slayer here, uh, who might actually be looking to eat some brains, so, I think a little quiet moseying, no hard feelings, and I'm sure your demon horde won't think any the less of you."
RAZOR,"(shakes head) Now, my boys, see, that's tricky. They came looking for a massacre..."
RAZOR,"(Buffy's POV, muffled) ...and I think you got exactly enough magic between you for a kiddie birthday party."
WILLOW,Then you'd be wrong.
RAZOR,"Whoa. Well, I better back off, or you might, what? Pull a rabbit out of a hat?"
ANYA,"(horrified) Don't, don't do that! (to Tara) Why would she do that? (Tara shakes her head)"
WILLOW,We don't want trouble ... you don't want trouble.
RAZOR,"Of course we want trouble, we're demons. We're really all about trouble."
WILLOW,Not this kind.
RAZOR,Oh. I get your point.
RAZOR,"Now let me tell you something, children. We're not gonna fight you. We're just gonna hold you down and enjoy ourselves for a few hours."
RAZOR,(OS) You might even live through it. (Buffy walks forward) Except that certain of my boys got some...
RAZOR,"...anatomical incompatibilities that, uh, tend to tear up little girls. (grins) So, who wants to go first?"
RAZOR,I was really hoping it'd be you.
ANYA,Does this mean we win?
DAWN,There. What's that?
SPIKE,"It's just a machine, Dawn."
DAWN,I know.
BUFFYBOT,Dawn. You're my sister Dawn.
BUFFYBOT,(looks around in confusion) Where did I go?
DAWN,What?
BUFFYBOT,Where did I go? I was here. Here. But then I ran away.
DAWN,(confused) I-I don't...
BUFFYBOT,No. Not me. The other Buffy.
BUFFYBOT,Yes. The other Buffy.
DAWN,Buffy?
BUFFYBOT,I don't ... I don't ... know where she ran off to. Maybe-
SPIKE,"Tsk. Look what those filthy buggers done to you. (loudly, to Dawn) Willow's slap-and-paste job's not gonna do the trick this time. Robot's done."
SPIKE,"Hey. (looks all around, alarmed) Little bit? (yells) Dawn!"
SPIKE,(OS) Dawn!
TARA,"Well, they wanted a massacre."
XANDER,"She's Buffy. She's herself again. (She looks at him) You're back, Buffy, you really are."
XANDER,Whoa. (gently) Whoa.
WILLOW,Buffy!
ANYA,Where's she going?
TARA,Should we follow her?
WILLOW,I don't know.
XANDER,She just ... needs some time is all.
XANDER,(OS) The important thing is that she's back. She'll be fine.
ANYA,"Xander, look out!"
RAZOR,Now what kind of Slayer is it runs out on her buddies just when they need her the most?
WILLOW,Obfuscate.
WILLOW,Fragilis.
RAZOR,"So, witch, got a little power after all. Well, let's see what tricks you can manage while I choke the life outta-"
WILLOW,Tara!
TARA,Nobody messes with my girl.
XANDER,"Tara, nice axing."
TARA,My first.
WILLOW,Buffy.
Cut to,Shot of the tower from afar.
DAWN,"(flashback) Buffy, no."
BUFFY,"(now) Dawnie, I have to."
DAWN,(now) Buffy?
DAWN,Buffy...
DAWN,Buffy ... (amazed) how....
DAWN,Is it you? I mean really?
DAWN,What are you do-
DAWN,(shrieks) No!
DAWN,Don't!
DAWN,"Don't jump, Buffy, don't move! Just walk to me. Please!"
DAWN,Please?
DAWN,"I'm your sister. Dawn. We were up here ... together, and then ... you went away. And you don't wanna do that again. I don't know how you're back, but you are, and please, just stay still."
DAWN,Or-or move. But-but towards me. Because the tower was built by crazy people and I don't think it's holding up very well.
DANW,Talk to me. Say something!
BUFFY,(quietly) Is ... this hell?
DAWN,(confused) What?
BUFFY,Is this hell?
DAWN,"No! Buffy, no! (taking a tiny step closer) You're here ... with me. (another tiny step) Whatever happened to you, whatever you've been through, it's ... it's over now. You're-"
DAWN,We have to get off this tower!
BUFFY,(quietly) It was so ... clear ... on this spot. I remember ... how ... shiny ... and clear everything was. (shakes her head) But ... now ... now...
DAWN,Buffy ... please ... listen to me.
DAWN,You told me I had to be strong ... and I've tried. (tearful) But it's been so hard without you.
DAWN,"I'm sorry. I promise I'll do better, I will! (still tearful) If you're with me. Stay with me ... please. I need you to live. Live! For-"
DAWN,Buffy!
BUFFY,(softly) Dawn.
DAWN,Buffy!
BUFFY,(louder) Dawn!
DAWN,(tentatively) Buffy?
DAWN,Buffy. You ... you ... (touches Buffy's cheek) ...you're really here.
DAWN,"(crying) You're alive, and you're home. You're home."
