68,"""A New Man"" Transcript"
Riley,"(between kisses) We're not expecting anyone, are we?"
Buffy,Willow said she was going to be at the science library all night.
Riley,Is that right?
Buffy,"Uh, apparently not."
Willow,(worried) We got trouble.
Buffy,(serious) What is it?
Willow,I was in the rec room.  It came through the window.
Riley,Vampire?
Willow,Vampires don't breathe fire.
Riley,I should call for backup.
Buffy,No time.
Buffy,We have to make this fast.  I have better things to do tonight than kill.
Everybody,SURPRISE!!!
Willow,"(smiling) Guess you won't be killing anything tonight, after all."
Buffy,(sly grin) Don't be so sure.
Giles,"Yeah, this is a lively space.  It's like the activity room we had at public school."
Giles,"Sorry (chuckles)  I, uh, one time I, uh, I was up to a little bit of a prank with the dart board--"
Anya,(to Xander) I'm bored.  Let's eat.
Xander,"(sternly) Anya, we've talked about this."
Anya,"(to Giles) I'm sorry, that was rude.  Please continue your story. (seems proud of herself as she looks to Xander)"
Giles,(not amused) Go and eat.
Willow,(handing him the plate) Giles!  Hi.  Are you having a good time?
Giles,"(standing) Yes. Yes.  There's, uh, a lot of new faces here, aren't there?"
Willow,Yeah.  Mostly kids from the dorm. A couple of Riley's friends.
Buffy,"(happy) Hi, Giles."
Giles,Buffy.  Happy Birthday.
Buffy,Thank you.
Giles,"(smiling) Nineteen.  It's hard to believe, isn't it?"
Buffy,"There's somebody here I want you to meet.  Uh, this is Riley Finn (he steps forward and Giles needs to put down his plate to shake his hand) . . .. my boyfriend."
Riley,"(as Giles gives Buffy a surprised look) It's very nice to meet you, Mr. Giles.  Did you help plan this?  It was quite a surprise."
Giles,"(to Riley) The first of many.  Uh, been . . . dating long?"
Buffy,Giles was the librarian at my high school.
Riley,"Ah, I've seen the library.  It's gone down hill since you left."
Giles,(chuckling) Yes.  I-I-I'm embarrassed to say that I actually miss it at times.
Riley,"So, you're retired?"
Giles,(frowns) I'm sorry?
Riley,Or . . . you're working somewhere else now?
Giles,"(slightly embarrassed) Well, not, uh . . . sort of between projects, uh, right now, uh,  it's a personal--"
Buffy,"Oh! Oh, look.  Giles has no cake."
Riley,"Oh, here.  Here, I'll get you a piece."
Buffy,"Oh, he's just nervous.  But this is so nice. Having everyone together for my birthday. Of course, you could smash in all my toes with a hammer and it will still be the bestest Buffy Birthday Bash in a big long while."
Giles,"Right.  A-a-actually, Willow a-a-and Xander did all the planning. I'm not sure I would have gone with the surprise party.  (smiles) You know, you have enough things jumping out at you in the dark."
Buffy,Professor Walsh says that adrenaline is like exercise but without the exorbitant gym fees.
Giles,(a beat) Very whitty.
Buffy,You should meet her.  She's absolutely the smartest person I've ever met.
Giles,(feeling a bit slighted) Perhaps we should have invited Professor Walsh to the party? (takes of sip of punch)
Buffy,"Oh, no.  I mean, she's like forty. She's got better things to do than hang out with a bunch of kids."
Riley,"Here you go, sir."
basement,"abode de Xander. Spike is seen walking back and forth as if looking for something to pack in his bag, cigarette in his mouth. Xander is standing on the other side of the room and Anya is lounging on the recliner, browsing a comic book."
Xander,(impatiently) You own nothing. This shouldn't be taking so long.
Spike,Hang on. Let a fella get organized.
Xander,That's my radio!
Spike,And you're what? Shocked and disappointed? I'm evil!
Anya,"(putting comic aside) So, what kind of place are you looking for?"
Spike,"I don't know.  Maybe a crypt. Some place, you know, dark and dank. But not as dark and dank as this."
Anya,"Heh.  It's pretty depressing, isn't it?"
Spike,"I've known corpses with a fresher smell. In fact, I've been one. (flicks is cigarette away)"
Xander,That's it!  Let's go.
Anya,Wait. (gets up and unplugs the tall three-head lamp and brings it over to him) I want to give you something for your new place.
Xander,That's my lamp.
Anya,A gift is traditional.  I've read about it.
Xander,That's among friends.  With bitter enemies we don't give them my lamp.
Spike,"It's not gonna have electricity anyway.  It's a crypt, remember?"
Anya,What about running water? A fridge to keep your blood fresh?
Spike,(a beat) No.
Anya,"Well, that's gotta suck.  You should just get a hotel room or something."
Spike,(considers) Demon girl's got a point.  I need fresh blood.  If I had a few bob for a room with an honor bar--
Xander,Out!  Before I get the Slayer over here to kick your ass out!
Spike,"(sighs, picks up his long coat) Don't know why she didn't come.  Say good-bye, shed a few tears."
Xander,"Well, she has an appointment with somebody who's actually still *scary*!"
Walsh,"So, the Slayer."
Buffy,Yeah. That's me.
Walsh,We thought you were a myth.
Buffy,"Well, you were myth-taken. (smiles but sees that neither are gonna laugh and stops)"
Walsh,"And to think all that time you were sitting in my class.  Well, most of those times.  I always knew you could do better than a B minus. Now I understand your energies were directed in the same places as ours, in fact.  It's only our methods that differ.  We use the latest in scientific technology and state-of-the-art weaponry and you, if I understand correctly, poke them with a sharp stick."
Buffy,"Well, it's more effective than it sounds."
Walsh,"Oh, , I'm, heh, quite sure of that. As I'm just as sure that we can learn much from each other.  I'm working on getting you clearance to come into the Initiative. I think you'll find the results of our operation most impressive. Agent Finn here, alone, has killed or captured-- how many is it?"
Riley,"(note of pride) Seventeen.  Eleven vampires, six demons."
Buffy,"Oh . . . Wow. (trying to sound impressed) I mean, that's . . . seventeen."
Walsh,What about you?
Buffy,Me?
Walsh,How many hostiles would you say you've slain?
Giles,"""Third new moon after the . . . nine-hundredth feast of Delthrox."" Oh, (stands up) crap."
Giles,"No, we can't wait for her, Willow. The demon Prince Barvain is going to rise tonight.  Well-- Where is she, exactly?"
Riley,Wow.
Buffy,"Those are my best stories. And I didn't tell you the ""Buffy breaks her butt"" stories."
Riley,"But you've killed a-- You did the thing with that-- Uh, you drowned.  And the snake!  Not to mention the . . daily . . slayage of  (pause) Wow."
Buffy,"It's no big, really. (cheerfully) Hey, who wants ice cream!"
Riley,"Buffy.  When I saw you stop the world from, you know, ending . . . I just assumed that was a big week for you. Turns out I suddenly find myself . . . needing to know the plural of ""apocalypse."""
Buffy,Look.  If you've been fighting since you were fifteen you'd have a hefty resume' too.
Riley,(shocked) Fifteen!?
Buffy,"(winces) I know, ""wow.""  The point is, that, that we have different amounts of experience. You know.  And plus, I do have that whole preternatural Slayer strength deal."
Riley,(nodding) I've seen.  Don't get me wrong. The girls I grew up with could hold their own.  But . . . I'm not even sure I could take you.
Buffy,That all depends on your meaning.
Walsh,Yeah?
Giles,"Professor Walsh, I presume. You're hard to find. These--these halls are quite the labyrinth.  I felt like Theseus and the Minotaur in the . . . labyrinth."
Walsh,"(a beat) Can I help you with something, Mr. . . . ?"
Giles,"Giles. Rupert. (walks over and offers his hand, Walsh shakes it) I'm looking for Buffy Summers.  I'm, uh, a friend of hers. And I was her high school librarian."
Walsh,"I'm sorry, Buffy's not here.  But if I see her . . ."
Giles,Buffy's been very influenced by your cause.  She quotes you quite often. (smiles) Sometimes she sounds like an introductory textbook herself.
Walsh,(returning to her desk) I don't lecture from the text book.  But I'm glad she's inspired by the material. She's bright.  All she's really been lacking is encouragement in the academic sect.
Giles,"Oh, uh, I think it's best if-if. . . if we let a young person find their own strengths. If you lead a child by the hand then they'll never find their own footing."
Walsh,"And if it's true about hiking, ergo, it must be true about life."
Giles,"(removing his glasses to polish them with a handkerchief) That's not, uh . . . I'm just saying Buffy is, uh, well she's not the typical student. Once you get to know her, she's a very unique girl.  I hope you're not going to push her."
Walsh,I think I do know her.  And I have found her to be a unique woman.
Giles,"""Woman.""  Of course.  How wrong of me to choose my own words."
Walsh,"She's very self-reliant, very independent--"
Giles,Exactly!
Walsh,--which is not always a good thing. (this causes Giles to pause) I think it can be unhealthy to take on adult roles too early. What I suspect I'm seeing is a reaction to the absence of a male role model.
Giles,(squinting) Absence?
Walsh,(standing) Buffy clearly lacks a strong father figure.
Walsh,"I'm sorry, I have things to do.  I'll tell Buffy her *friend* was looking for her."
Willow,"This prince/demon guy was supposed to rise at sunset so aren't we, like, late?"
Giles,Of course if I hadn't had to search the globe for our Miss Summers and do battle with that harridan. . . .
Xander,And if you hadn't gotten lost on campus afterwards . . .
Giles,"Never mind. I'll just have to take care of it myself.  I've vanquished a few demons in my day without her. Of course, it wouldn't surprise me if we're entirely too late.  Demon on the loose, carnage everywhere."
Xander,Your better demons will clean up after themselves.
Giles,"(confused) I don't understand.  (moves to the center of the chamber, scanning with his flashlight) Umm, there should be ruptured earth and-and broken stone.  Oh, well, apparently it hasn't happened yet.  A bit of luck."
Willow,"Or, you know what I bet? I-I bet the Initiative took care of it."
Giles,Who?
Xander,"Oh, Riley and his guys. Probably all over it."
Willow,"Yeah.  It has that ""too neat"" look.  They must have cleaned up the place."
Giles,What?
Willow,"Oh, they read hot spots. Areas of otherworldy energy. (looking around) They must've picked this place up days ago."
Giles,"Stop, both of you. Uh, what, uh . . . What are you talking about?  W-what's the Initiative?  What. . . what on earth does it have to do with Buffy's new boyfriend?"
Willow,You know.  I'm sure you know.  Riley's one of the commandos.
Giles,"(exasperated) What?!  Well that's marvelous, isn't it? (turns away in a fit) Here I am, spent weeks trying, uh, t-to get a single scrap of information about our mysterious demon collectors and no one bothers to tell me that Buffy's dating one of them?! (faces them) Who else knows?!"
Xander,"No one.  No one else knows this. (pauses) Anya, and that's it!"
Willow,(sheepishly) And Spike.
Giles,Ssspike?! Spike knew?
Xander,"Only the basic stuff.  You know, that Riley is a commando and Professor Walsh is in charge."
Giles,(furious) Professor Walsh!?  That fishwife!?
Willow,"You know, she's actually not that bad once you get to-- (sees Giles' look) So, th-the demon is probably a little late. W-we'll just, you know--"
Giles,"Oh, forget it. Go on.  You two clear off.  I'll just stay a little longer just in case."
Willow,You sure? 'Cause we can stay.
Giles,No. Go.
Giles,Who am I kidding?
Giles,(muttering) Nothing is gonna  happen.
Ethan,"I wouldn't say that.  (cut to front closing shot of Ethan Rayne) I wouldn't say that at all. In fact, Ripper, old mate, I'd say something rather interesting was about to hap--"
Giles,Did someone--?
Ethan,"(caught) Oh, bugger! I thought you'd gone!"
Giles,Ethan Rayne.  You have no idea how much thrashing you is gonna improve my day.
Ethan,"(scared) No, no, no! Wait! Hang on! You-you can beat the crap out of me. Go ahead, I can't stop you! (Giles cocks back his fist) Or-or you can listen to what I have to say.  Find out what's going on."
Giles,What are you talking about?
Ethan,Something bad is happening.  Bad for both of us.
Giles,Bad for you. (cocks fist again)
Ethan,"No, no, no! Listen!  You have to listen! You're going to need time to prepare!"
Ethan,Brilliant!  Now isn't this more fun than kicking my ass?
Giles,No.
Ethan,Oh.  It's more fun for me.
Giles,(raising his glass) Just tell me what you want to tell me.
Ethan,"(mock hurt) Oh, so crass.  We used to be friends, Ripper.  When did all that fall apart?"
Giles,The same time you started to worship chaos.
Ethan,"Oh, religious intolerance.  Sad, there.  I mean, just look at the Irish troubles. (annoyed, Giles starts to rise to leave) Oh, hang on, I'll tell ya. (Giles settles down again) Something happening in the darkworlds. It's always been rumors out there but . . . only one thing's coming through clear.. That something's harming demons and it's not the Slayer. Know anything about it?"
Giles,(takes a drink) What are they saying?
Ethan,"Heh, you know demons. It's all exaggeration and blank verse.  ""Pain as bright as steel"" things like that. They're scared. There's something called ""314"" that's got them scared most of all. The kind of scared that turns to angry. I know we're not particularly fond of each other, (Giles chuckles scoffingly) Rupert. But we are a couple of old mystics. This knew outfit, it's blundering into new places it doesn't belong. It's throwing the worlds out of balance. And that's way beyond chaos, mate. We're headed quite literally for one hell of a fight."
shot,"we see she is sparring with Riley on workout mats, circling each other.  He's dressed in sweats and a T-shirt.  Buffy's in a white long sleeve shirt and blue jeans, with a scarf wrapped over her long flowing hair. She throws a few more jabs and he blocks them and counters with a one-two combo Buffy easily ducks under.  They continue to circle.  Buffy launches three roundkicks in quick succession. He blocks the first two then sidesteps the third gets up behind her and wrapping his arms around her."
Riley,(smiling) Are you pulling back?
Buffy,(grinning) Are you?
Riley,(shrugs) Maybe a little.
Buffy,"Maybe a little, too."
Riley,I'll go all out if you will.
Buffy,Are you sure?
Riley,(serious) Here we go.
Buffy,Riley!
Buffy,Are you hurt?
Riley,"I, uh, (groans) I don't think so."
Buffy,"I'm so sorry. I-I didn't mean to, uh--"
Riley,(sounds unsure) It's fine.  I'm good.
Giles,"(faltering voice) You know what gets me?  This is what gets me. Twenty years I've been fighting demons.  Maggie Walsh and her Nancy-ninja boys come in and six months later, demons are pissing themselves with fear. They never even noticed me."
Ethan,(drunkenly) Who's Maggie Walsh?
Giles,"Oh, she's awful. She said I was an absent male role model. Absent my ass. I'm twice the man she is."
Ethan,(OS) You know you're really very attractive.
Giles,Hm?
Ethan,"Here's my name and number. (hands it to her) You give me a call, I'll show you a good time."
Waitress,"(unimpressed) Yeah, thanks."
Giles,"We gotta face it, we've changed.  We'll not you . . . you're still sadistic and self-centered."
Ethan,(toasting himself) Here's to me.
Giles,"The world has past us by.  Someone snuck in and left us a couple of has-beens in our place. This Initiative, I mean, their methods may be causing problems, but they're getting the job done. Where am I?  I'm an unemployed librarian with a tendency to get knocked on the head."
Ethan,"Well, we won't have to worry about that anymore now, mate.  (serious tone) When you went to the loo I slipped a small pellet of poison in your drink.  You'll be dead in an hour."
Ethan,Just kidding!
Giles,(calming down) I'm gonna feel like hell in the morning.
Ethan,Relax.  Enjoy the night. We're just a couple of sorcerers.  The night is still our time. Time of magic.
Giles,To magic.
room,"dorm unknown, room number unknown.  It is very dim. The walls are black and strewn with a string of white Christmas lights that give the place a mystical look.  Tara is kneeling on the floor pouring white powder, sand, or salt in the design of a four-point star in a circle. Willow is holding a red rose."
Willow,(sitting across from her) I'm glad you wanted to get together. I know it's late.
Tara,Thanks. (a beat) I was happy you called.
Willow,We'll start out slow.
Tara,Okay.
Tara,Willow?
Willow,Yeah?
Tara,(eyes opening) Start out slow doing what?
Willow,"(in a soft voice) Oh. We're gonna float the rose.  Then use the majiks to pluck the petals off, one at a time. It's a test of synchronicity.  Our minds have to be perfectly attuned to work as a single delicate implement."
Tara,"(a moment, then smiles) Cool."
Willow,And it should be very pretty.
Tara,(softly) It worked.
Willow,(softly) Now for the hard part.  The petals.
Willow,(shocked) What the heck was that?
Tara,"I don't know, but, uh, the petals are off. (chuckling)"
Giles,(yawning) I feel like hell in the morning.
Giles,(eyes popping wide open) Uh! Wha-- Wha--(touching his horns) No!
Giles,Damn!
Giles,Ethan.
Giles,"(grimacing) Oh, and I liked that shirt!"
Buffy,"I like pancakes 'cause they're stackable. (looks at Willow's plate) Ooo, and waffles 'cause you can put things in the little holes if you wanted to."
Willow,(laughing) You should always have a new boyfriend.  You're so much fun right now.
Buffy,Hey.  I didn't hear you come in last night. Where were you?
Willow,"(quickly) The chem lab, by myself. (a beat) I-I was trying this new spell; floating a rose, when all of a sudden (motions with fork) zing, zing, zing! Like all over the room.  It was like a rose-based missile."
Buffy,Yikes.
Willow,I know.  I think there's something out there. I-I felt this presence.. This dark majiks energy blocking the spell. It's new.
Buffy,Someone else doing majiks?
Willow,"Maybe.  If so, it's someone pretty powerful."
Buffy,Hmm.  I'll tell Giles about it. Or maybe I'll tell Maggie. She seemed kind of interested in learning the mystical side of the whole demon hunting biz.
Willow,Tell Giles. He's feeling a little hurt right now. (Buffy frowns in question) How come you never told him about Riley being a commando?
Buffy,I did. (Willow shakes her head) I didn't?
Willow,He says no.  He's feeling neglected and out-of-the-loopy.
Buffy,"Well, I didn't at first because Riley said not to. And . . and then ""meow"" cat out of the bag and I-I guess I just forgot that he didn't know. (cheerfully) I'll make it up to him when I see him.  Tomorrow.  I'm spending today with Riley."
Willow,"Oh, yeah.  I forgot that's what you always do on the days when the earth rotates."
Buffy,"(smiling) It's just going so well, right now.  I think.  (stops smiling) I hope. (grins sheepishly) I sort of kicked him across the room last night."
Willow,"Uh, that's not good."
Buffy,"Well, we were sparring and he said not to hold back.  And he's a little dented.  But he said he was okay with it and I think he's okay with it --do-do you think he's okay with it?"
Willow,"I'm sure he is.  I mean, if he's not . . . you know, you had to do it. He's right.  You can't walk around pretending you're less than you are. It wouldn't be right for you to hold back."
Buffy,Right. (frowns)
Willow,What?
Buffy,(a beat) I held back a little.
Giles,(surprised) Still asleep? (sees the clock) It's ten thirty in the morning.
Giles,"(whispering) Xander.  Xander, wake up."
Xander,(sleepily) Mom?
Giles,"No, it's not mum. Now, when you look at me . . . you may be a little alarmed but there's no need, it-it's me. Giles. Now, Ethan has turned me into a demon and I need your help."
Giles,"Hello.  Yes, it's me."
Giles,(Xander's POV: speaking a demon language)
Xander,AHHH!
Giles,"Xander, listen!  Don't you understand me?"
Giles,(Xander's POV: speaking demon language)
Xander,(shouting) Demon! Demon!
Giles,(Xander's POV: speaking demon language)
Giles,"Please, don't you understand? (Xander starts grabbing pots and pans from his shelves and throws them at him) No, no! Don't! Xander! Xander, calm down!  Ow! You're just a little overwrought. Oww!"
Giles,(Xander's POV: growls in frustration and runs out the door)
Xander,That's right!  Run for your life!
Giles,"(panicked) Oh, God.  I'm sorry!"
Mother,(grabbing her child) Call 911!
Giles,(running away) Bloody humans!
Buffy,So it had pointy things. What kind of pointy things?
Xander,"The pointy kind.  And tufty ears. Oh, and it might have a sauce pan shape bruise. (trails off as they stop)"
Willow,Giles will know what it . . . was.
Buffy,Giles?
Buffy,Looks like Xander wasn't the only one to get a visitor today.
Xander,(coming back down) He's not upstairs.
Willow,"Oh, God, Giles."
Buffy,"Okay.  There's a demon and Giles is gone.  But it doesn't mean that he's hurt. I mean, there's no blood anywhere so maybe the demon just took him somewhere?"
Anya,(mildly) I think it ate him up.
Spike,"Well.  What do I spy with my little eye? (Giles stops) A demon.  That would be . . . oh, right . . . the things I can kill."
Giles,"(""why me?"" tone) Spike. Wonderful.  A perfect end to a perfect day."
Spike,(frowning) Giles?
Giles,"(turning around, fists up) Go on, then.  Let's get on with the fighting-- You understand me?"
Spike,Of course I understand you.
Giles,I'm speaking English?
Spike,"No, you're speaking Fyarl.  I happen to speak Fyarl.  And . . . by the way, why the hell are you suddenly a Fyarl demon? You just come over all demony this morning?"
Giles,"As a matter of fact, I did. Thanks to Ethan Rayne.  You have to help me find him. He must undo this and then he needs a . . .  good being killed."
Spike,And I'm just supposed to help you out of the evilness of my heart?
Giles,Y-you help me and I-I don't kill you.
Spike,"Oh, tremendously convincing. Try it again without the stutter. (takes a drag)"
Giles,Money.  I could pay you money.
Spike,"(steps closer and flicks cig away) Oh, I like money. How much?"
Giles,A h-hundred dollars.
Spike,A hundred dollars? You'll have to do a lot better than that.  Two-hundred.
Giles,Fine.
Spike,"(surprised for a second) Right, then."
Giles,"Right, then."
Spike,So what's first? (grinning) I run and tell the Slayer what you've gotten yourself into?
Giles,No. When I find Ethan I can clear all this up without Buffy ever having to find out that anything happened to me at all.
Xander,"Okay, that's a giant vulture.  I'd have mentioned it if it was a giant vulture."
Willow,"Buffy, even if we figure out what kind of demon got Giles --I mean, how are we gonna find it?"
Buffy,"We'll figure it out. (shows a book to Xander) Oh, this one has tufty ears."
Willow,(whispering) What was that?
Riley,Buffy?
Buffy,Riley. What are you doing here?
Riley,There were 911 calls from a couple of different places. Including here.
Xander,You get 911 calls?
Riley,We have a tap into the system.  It flags things with possible nonhuman causes. (Xander shakes his head in dismay and continues researching) We check them out. (to Buffy) What are you doing here?
Buffy,"This is Giles' apartment.  He's missing. The calls, did anyone see what did it?"
Riley,"Negative.  No.  Neighbors just heard, you know, growling, things breaking. Sounded like a struggle."
Willow,Poor Giles.
Buffy,We'll get him back.
Riley,What are you working on?
Buffy,"Uh, we have stuff. Pictures . . ."
Anya,(helpfully) We have nothing.
Riley,I'll help. The whole Initiative.  We'll do whatever you need.
Buffy,"Thanks. I just wish I knew what I needed. I keep thinking, ""let's ask Giles"" and then I remember."
Xander,He'd be great right now. He'd find himself in a second. Nobody is cooler in a crisis.
Giles,"If you can't find third gear, don't try for third gear!"
Spike,I'm doing my best.  I don't know if I'm driving this thing or wearing it.
Giles,It's perfectly serviceable.
Spike,"(laughs) Funny hearing a Fyarl demon say ""serviceable."" Had a couple of them working for me once. They're more like ""Like to crush.  Crush now?"" Strong though.  You won't meet a jar you can't open for the rest of your life."
Spike,(looks at him) What was that?  Did you growl?
Giles,"No. Listen, about this Fyarl demon. Do-do I have special powers? Like setting things on fire with my sizzling eye beams?"
Spike,"Well, you got the mucous thing."
Giles,What?  Mucous?
Spike,Paralyzing mucous. Shoots out through the nose. Sets on fast.  Hard as a rock.  Pretty good in a fight.
Giles,Are you making this up?
Spike,"(sly grin) Maybe. But hey, you feel a sneeze coming on, you warn me."
Giles,(growls) Turn here.
Giles,Down shift! Down shift!
Spike,"Calm down, will you?"
Giles,I'm not sure I can.  I feel like I'm changing.
Spike,(sighs) Fine with me. So long as you pay me.
Giles,(growling quality) I really like this feeling. Sort of mindless need to destroy. This anger and rage.
Spike,Good times. Go with it.
Giles,(almost normal voice again) No.
Spike,"Oh, it's fun. I can't do it, do it for me.  Now let yourself go."
Giles,"I refuse to become a monster because I look like a monster. I have a soul.  I have a conscience.  I am a human being.  Oh, stop the car!"
Giles,"(closing the door) Right. Let's go, then."
Xander,That's the thing that attacked me.
Willow,"A Fyarl demon.  Sort of a foot soldier type, works for other demons lots of the times. Very strong . . . ugh! And hey, mucous."
Buffy,Mucous?
Riley,"(cell phone beeps and he pulls it out) Agent Finn, go ahead."
Buffy,How do I kill it?
Willow,Silver. A weapon made of silver.
Riley,"Yes.  I understand. (hangs up) The demon attacked Professor Walsh. Got out of a small, gray car.  A Citroen."
Willow,It stole Giles' car.
Xander,Why would a demon steal a car?
Anya,Why would a demon steal *that* car?
Buffy,"A demon that steals a car has a reason. A purpose. But it doesn't sound like these Fyarl demons are really big independent thinkers. So, Will, the spells that are going wrong . . . could they be caused by someone using majiks to control a demon? Making this Fyarl demon attack Giles?"
Willow,"Yes.  Yeah, that would draw in a lot of dark energy."
Buffy,"Okay.  (standing) Willow, Xander: stay here. Who's ever controlling this demon may call and ask for a ransom.  Give them anything they want."
Xander,You got it.
Buffy,"Riley, you and I are going to the magic shop.  Maybe they needed supplies. Uh, something silver . . ."
Riley,A letter opener?  It's not very sharp.
Buffy,Then I'll have to put some muscle behind it.
Spike,"(suave) Two of them.  English like me. But older, less attractive. One of them gave you his number."
Waitress,"I threw it out. I mean, I took one look and saw that he was staying at that rat trap.  No thanks."
Spike,Which rat trap?
Waitress,The one by the highway.  The Sunnydale Motor Inn.
Spike,(smiles) Thank you.
Buffy,"Okay.  Credit card slips, sales receipt.  Help me look."
Riley,(disapprovingly) You shouldn't have done that to the door.
Buffy,I do not have time to play by the rules tonight.
Riley,I have a master key.  It opens every shop on Main Street.
Buffy,"Oh. Well . . . next time, absolutely."
Riley,I don't know what I'm looking for.
Buffy,"I do. (rips free a slip) (pissed, dumps the slips back in drawer and slams it) ""Ethan Rayne."""
Riley,Who's that?
Buffy,(handing it to him) Professional bad guy. He's gotta be the guy that made the demon attack Giles. (Riley's pulling out cell phone) At least we know who we're looking for.
Riley,"(into phone) Command, are you there?"
Buffy,What are you doing?
Riley,(into phone) It's agent Finn. I need a search. Local hotel registrations matching the name Ethan Rayne. R-A-Y-N-E. Call me back. (flips it close)
Buffy,(maybe impressed) You can do that?
Riley,It'll take a couple of minutes.
Buffy,Get in the car.  Be ready to go.
Riley,"Buffy. (she stops to face him) Earlier, when I talked to Professor Walsh, she gave me very specific orders."
Buffy,Yeah?
Riley,She said when we located the demon I . . . I'm not supposed to bring you along.
Buffy,(not missing a beat) Oh. (turns to leave)
Riley,"Uh, what are you doing?"
Buffy,(faces him) I'm *going* to the car.
Riley,"Buffy, I can't take you with me."
Buffy,You're not taking me with you.  I am going and I am letting you come along.
Riley,"Buffy, it's not really your call. This is a military operation now."
Buffy,(steely) Then call out the troops.  Because nothing less than that is gonna stop me.  This demon did something to Giles and I'm gonna kill it.
Spike,"How ya feeling, mate?"
Giles,(growling quality) Like snapping necks until everyone is dead.
Spike,Now that sounds like a Fyarl demon. Good for you.
Spike,"Hey, picked up a tail."
Giles,(almost normal voice) Yes.  Just a little one. It hurts when I sit.
Spike,I mean someone is following us. Humvee.  Military.
Giles,Well speed up. Lose them.
Spike,I got it floored. Why'd you buy this car?
Giles,"Well do something.  If they catch us, we'll both end up in a lab!"
Spike,It's getting closer.
Spike,And it's got a friend!
Giles,Damn!
Spike,"Oh, sure!  Dismantle the getaway car. That'll scare them."
Giles,Then slow down and I'll jump out. They'll follow you.
Spike,Hold on. These commandos. They're the same guys that are after me too..  Maybe I want you around to split their attention a bit?
Giles,I'll pay you another hundred dollars.
Ethan,Giles?
Ethan,Now-- it-it-- calm down!  (gets on the bed trying to escape) It's okay.  Good Giles.
Ethan,No! No! Don't kill me!
Ethan,(choking) I can't undo you if you kill me!
Ethan,(to Buffy) You've got to stop it! It killed Ripper and now it's trying to get me!
Buffy,"(glaring at Giles, but to Riley) Don't let him go."
Buffy,(very pissed) What did you do to him? What did you do?!
Spike,"(looking in rearview mirror) You just try and stop me, you stupid jar-- (CRASH!!!)"
Spike,"I can kill demons.  I can crash cars. . . . Things are looking up!""**"
Ethan,(watching) You're only going to make him angry.
Buffy,*This* is for Giles!
Giles,For me?
Buffy,"(shocked) Oh, God!  Giles!"
Giles,(from Buffy's POV: trying to say something in Fyarl)
Buffy,"(pleading) Oh, God! Giles! Giles! I'm so--I'm so sorry! Please don't die!"
Giles,"Actually, I feel quite well.  Except for the rage."
Buffy,(to Riley) I think he's okay.  I--(frowning at letter opener) is this thing real silver?
Ethan,"(pouting) I really got to learn to just do the damage and get out of town.  It's the ""stay and gloat"" that gets me every time."
Buffy,You okay?
Giles,"(sheepishly) Oh, um, uh, embarrassed, mostly.  Ethan's wardrobe's not helping any.  (faces her) Uh, how did you know it was me?"
Buffy,Your eyes. (off his look) You're the only person in the world that can looked *that* annoyed with me.
Ethan,Is this gonna go on much longer? I'd rather like to be going.
Buffy,(crossing her arms) And why would I let you go?
Ethan,"(pompously) Well, maybe because you have no choice. I'm human, you can't kill me.  What's a Slayer going to do to me?"
Riley,"(as Ethan is cuffed) By the authority of the US military, you're being taken into custody pending a determination of your status. (to MP) Take it from here."
Riley,"They'll, uh, take Mr. Rayne to a secret detention facility in the Nevada desert. I'm *sure* he'll be rehabilitated in no time."
Giles,"(grinning) Uh, if you don't mind, I'm just gonna --go and watch them manhandle him into a vehicle."
Buffy,Thanks.
Riley,I told you I'd help.
Buffy,"You did. If I'd had gotten here any later and if Giles had killed Ethan, I . . . never would have gotten him back."
Riley,You'd find some other way. (pause) You're really strong.  Like Spider-Man strong.
Buffy,Yeah.  But I don't stick to stuff.  But . . yeah.
Riley,"And you're in charge. You're like, make the plan, execute the plan.  No one giving you orders."
Buffy,(a beat) I'm the Slayer.
Riley,I like it.
Buffy,(smiles) Yeah?
Riley,But give me another . . oh . . week to get ready. And I'll take you down.
Buffy,Nice phone.
Giles,"Yes. Fabulous technology. See, if anyone has information I need to know, they can, uh, simply tell me about it.  (lifts the handpiece) Through this ingenious speaking tube.  I'm very excited."
Buffy,"I am sorry, Giles.  I really thought I told you about Riley and the Initiative.  And I know that it doesn't help. Look, I promise it won't happen again.  I will tell you everything."
Giles,"(walking towards the couch, removing his glasses) Buffy, I don't want to ask you to betray any confidences, and I certainly don't want to interfere--"
Buffy,"Uh-oh, you have ""but-face."" (Giles narrows his eyebrows at her) You look like you're gonna say ""but."""
Giles,"(a beat) But . . . this, um, Initiative, I'm-I'm a little concerned.  Ethan's not exactly a reliable source but, um . . . I'm not sure that he's wrong about them."
Buffy,I'm not dating the Initiative.  I'm dating Riley. He's a good guy.
Giles,And I-I believe that. But he's part of something we-we don't really understand.
Buffy,(knowingly) You sure you're not just saying this because you don't like Riley's boss?
Giles,"(as if offended) No! No.  I'm not saying that at all. (considers) Though I do . . . hate her quite a lot. But I want you to have your personal life, but . . . keep your eyes open. Make sure you know what you're getting into."
Walsh,So she walks in and the rules just suddenly break?
Riley,Umm . . . pretty much.
Walsh,Be careful with her. She reacts on instinct. There's no discipline there. Her loyalties are uncertain.
Riley,You won't be disappointed in her.  She's good at what she does. She is the truest soul I've ever known.
Walsh,"Oh, no (chuckling) oh, no!  Spontaneous poetic exclamations. Lord, spare me college boys in love."
Riley,I'm just saying she'll work out.  You'll be proud of her.
Walsh,You want to know what I think? (pause) I think you're probably right.
