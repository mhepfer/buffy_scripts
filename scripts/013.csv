character,dialogue
Willow,"Okay, um..."
Xander,It's your turn.
Willow,"I, alright, okay, uh... 'In the few hours that we had together,  we loved a lifetime's worth.'"
Xander,Terminator.
Willow,Good! Great.
Xander,"Um, oh, okay, I got one. (imitating Charlton Heston) 'It's a  madhouse! A mad...'"
Willow,(interrupts) Planet of the Apes.
Xander,"Can I finish, please?"
Willow,"Oh! Sorry, go ahead."
Xander,'...house!' (indicates she may answer)
Willow,"Planet of the Apes. Okay, good. Me. Uh..."
Xander,Well?
Willow,"I'm thinking. 'Use the Force, Luke.'"
Xander,Do I even have to dignify that with a guess?
Willow,I couldn't think of anything. It's a dumb game anyway.
Xander,"Well, what else do you wanna do? We already played rock, paper,  scissors. My hands cramped up."
Willow,"Well, yes, if you're always scissors of course your tendons are  gonna strain..."
Xander,"(interrupts) Y'know, I just gotta say that this has been the  most boring summer ever."
Willow,"Yeah, but on the plus side no monsters or stuff."
Xander,I'm just so restless! I'm actually looking forward to school  startin' up again.
Willow,"Yeah, and that wouldn't have anything to do with a certain girl  we both know who is a Vampire Slayer?"
Xander,"Please, I'm so over her. Did she, uh, mention when she might be  gettin' back? About which I do not care."
Willow,"I haven't heard from her. I got a couple postcards when she  went to L.A., but then, like, nothing."
Xander,"Well, she's probably with her dad having a good time."
Willow,And you don't care?
Xander,"Well, okay, there might be some interest. I'm a man. I have  certain desires, certain needs..."
Willow,Uhhh! I don't wanna know.
Xander,I got a movie for ya! (taps her nose with his ice cream)
Willow,(surprised) Xander!
Xander,"You're Amish! You can't fight back... 'cause you're Amish! I  mock you with my ice cream cone, Amish guy!"
Willow,Witness. (pouty) My nose is cold.
Xander,Let me get that for ya. (leans in to lick off her nose)
Willow,Xander! (stops him)
Xander,"I'm sorry, I can't help myself. Your nose looks so tasty."
Xander,"Willow, go!"
Buffy,"Hi, guys!"
Buffy,Miss me?
Willow,Buffy!
Xander,Hey! (hugs her)
Buffy,"Hey. Hey, Will! (hugs her)"
Xander,"(hugs Buffy again) Man, your timing really doesn't suck.  (laughs)"
Willow,When'd you get back?
Buffy,"Uh, just now. Dad drove me down. And I figured you two losers  would be getting into some kind of trouble."
Willow,I think we had the upper hand. I-in a subtle way.
Buffy,Does either of you even have a cross? Very sloppy.
Xander,"Well, it's been a slow summer. I mean, that's the first vampire  we've seen since you killed the Master."
Buffy,It's like they knew I was coming back.
Xander,"So, what about you? How was your summer? Did you slay anything?"
Buffy,"No. Uh, just hung out, partied some, shopping was also a major  theme."
Xander,"Well, you haven't lost your touch. That vampire..."
Buffy,"I did kinda whale on him, didn't I?"
Xander,(notices) I like your hair.
Buffy,"(giggles) So, how did you guys fare? Did you have any fun  without me?"
Xander,No.
Willow,Yes!
Xander,"Uh, our summer was kinda yawnworthy. Our biggest excitement was  burying the Master."
Willow,"That's right, you missed it. (points) Right out by that tree.  (Buffy looks) Giles buried the bones and we poured holy water and we got  to wear robes."
Xander,Very intense. You shoulda been.
Willow,Have you seen Giles?
Buffy,Why would I do that? I'll see him at school.
Xander,"Man, I'm really glad you're back."
Buffy,"(looks at the tree again) Me, too."
Hank,"Okay, then. This is the last of it. (puts another suitcase on the  bed)"
Joyce,More clothes?
Hank,"Oh, do shoes count as clothes?"
Joyce,How much shopping did you let her do?
Hank,"Oh, I just thought I was saving you from the big back-to-school  clothing nightmare. (unzips the suitcase)"
Joyce,My nightmares of Buffy in school have nothing to do with  clothes. Did she manage to stay out of trouble in L.A.?
Hank,"She did, yeah. She was, um... you know, great."
Joyce,But?
Hank,"She was just, I don't know, um... distant. Not brooding or  sulking, just... there was no connection. The more time we spent  together, the more I felt like she was nowhere to be seen."
Joyce,Hence the shoes?
Hank,(hands her the shoes) I may have overcompensated a little bit.
Joyce,Hmm.
Hank,"It's so strange. You know, at least when she was burning stuff  down I knew what to say."
Joyce,"Well, welcome to my world. I haven't been able to get through to  her for so long. I'll just be happy if she makes it through the school  year."
Cordelia,"It was a nightmare, a total nightmare."
Cordelia,"I mean, they promised me they'd take me to St. Croix, and  then they just decide to go to Tuscany. (exhales) Art and buildings? I  was totally beachless for a month and a half. No one has suffered like I  have. Of course I think that that kind of adversity builds character.  Well, then I thought, I already have a lot of character. Is it possible  to have too much character?"
Snyder,The first day back. It always gets me.
Giles,Yes.
Snyder,"I mean, it's incredible. One day the campus is completely bare.  Empty. The next, there are children everywhere. Like locusts. Crawling  around, mindlessly bent on feeding and mating. Destroying everything in  sight in their relentless, pointless desire to exist."
Giles,"I do enjoy these pep talks. Have you ever considered, given your  abhorrence of children, school's principal was not, perhaps, your true  vocation?"
Snyder,Somebody's got to keep an eye on them. They're just a bunch of  hormonal time bombs. (takes two steps away from Giles) Every time a  pretty girl walks by every boy turns into a gibbering fool.
Giles,Ms. Calendar!
Jenny,Mr. Giles!
Giles,"Well, I, uh, um... Hello!"
Snyder,You see the way these kids gaze at each other... all moony.
Jenny,It's good to see you.
Giles,Yes.
Snyder,You think they're thinking about learning?
Giles,"Uh, were you headed to the, uh, faculty room?"
Jenny,Sounds like fun!
Snyder,"I try and tell 'em about the important things in life.  Discipline, responsibility, punctuality. Might as well be talking to  myself."
Giles,How was your summer?
Jenny,"Extreme. I did Burning Man in Black Rock, ohhh, such a great  festival, you should've been there. They had drum rituals, mobile  sculptures, raves, naked mud dances, you would've just... hated it with  a fiery passion!"
Giles,"I can't imagine finding any redeeming, uh... (stops at the base  of the stairs) Naked?"
Jenny,Hmm. And you probably spent all summer with your nose in a book.
Giles,Yes. I suppose you'd consider that frightfully dull.
Jenny,Depends on the book. (smiles)
Willow,Giles!
Xander,Yo! G-man! What's up?
Giles,Nice to see you. And don't ever call me that.
Jenny,"Hi, kids."
Willow,Hi!
Giles,(to Buffy) How are you?
Buffy,Live and kicking.
Willow,Buffy killed a vampire last night.
Buffy,"Uh, I think you can get a little more volume if you speak from  the diaphragm."
Willow,Sorry.
Jenny,(quietly) We've got vampires? I thought the Hellmouth was  closed.
Giles,"Well, it's, it's closed, but not gone. The mystical energy that  emanates from it is still concentrated in this area."
Xander,Which means we're still the undead's favorite party town.
Giles,"I wonder if they're here for any purpose, particularly."
Buffy,You're the Watcher. I just work here.
Giles,"Yes, I-I must consult my books."
Xander,"Oh, eight minutes and thirty-three seconds, pay up. (Willow  hands him a dollar) I called ten minutes before you'd consult your books  about something. (to Willow) Thanks."
Willow,We better get to class.
Giles,"Oh, uh, Buffy! (she looks back) Uh, I realize you've only just  returned, but when you're ready I-I think we should start your training  again."
Buffy,I'm ready. I'll see you after school. (starts to go again)
Giles,"Well, I-I-I understand if, if you want a few days to..."
Buffy,I'm ready. (leaves)
Giles,"Buffy, that's enough."
Giles,Buffy!
Giles,"Uh, safe to say you've stayed in shape."
Buffy,"(breathing hard) I'm ready. Whatever they've got coming next,  I'm ready. (bunches her hair above her head) Yeah."
Absalom,"We have been put down, kinsmen. We have lost our way. We have  lost the night. But despair is for the living. Where they are weak, we  will be strong. Where they weep, we rejoice. Where they bleed, (laughs)  we drink! Within three days a New Hope will arise. We will put our faith  in him. (looks over at Collin) He will show us the way."
Xander,Buffy! (no response) Buffy!
Buffy,(back on earth) Fine! I'm fine.
Xander,Good! It's good that you're fine.
Willow,What were you thinking about? (gets out an apple)
Buffy,Nothing.
Xander,"Oh, c'mon, you can tell us. We're your bosom friends! The  friends of your bosom!"
Willow,Xander.
Buffy,"I wasn't thinking anything, really."
Willow,What'd you do last night?
Buffy,Mm. Slept. I had weird dreams.
Xander,Dreams are meaningful.
Willow,"Tsh! Tell me about it. The other night I dreamt that Xander...  Uh, I-it wasn't Xander. I-in fact it wasn't me. It was a friend's dream,  and she doesn't remember it."
Buffy,I bet she doesn't.
Giles,(finds them) Buffy!
Buffy,Giles! (gets up) What is it? You look worried.
Giles,"This vampire activity, I think I know what they're up to."
Buffy,"Well, we'll deal with it."
Giles,I hope it's that simple.
Buffy,It is not to worry. Trust me.
Giles,"Oh, I don't know. I mean, (chuckles) I've killed you once, it  shouldn't be too difficult to do it again."
Buffy,What?
Buffy,Hello.
Angel,Mind if I come in?
Buffy,Be my guest.
Angel,How are you?
Buffy,"Peachy. So, is this a social call? It is kinda late. Or, well,  it is for me, anyway. What is it for you, lunch hour?"
Angel,It's not a social call.
Buffy,"Ah. So, lemme guess. That means grave danger. Gosh, it's good to  be home."
Angel,I'm sorry. I wish I had better news.
Buffy,"So, some of your cousins are in town for a family barbecue, and  we're all on the menu!"
Angel,The Anointed One. He's been gathering forces somewhere in town.  I'm not sure why.
Buffy,"Guess I'll find out soon enough, huh?"
Angel,You don't sound too concerned.
Buffy,"I can handle myself. Besides, I could use a little action  anyway."
Angel,Don't underestimate the Anointed One just because he looks like  a child. He has power over the rest of them. They'll do anything for  him.
Buffy,"Is that it? Is that everything? Y'know, 'cause you woke me up  from a really good dream."
Angel,"Sorry. I'll go. (turns around to go, but pauses) I missed you."
Buffy,(turns to the window) I missed you?
Lyrics,<I>It doesn't matter what I want / It doesn't matter what I need</I>
Lyrics,<I>It doesn't matter if I cry</I>
Joyce,How are your new classes?
Buffy,Good.
Lyrics,<I>Don't matter if I bleed</I>
Joyce,Good. Is there the slightest chance that if I asked you what was  wrong you would tell me?
Lyrics,<I>You've been on a road</I>
Joyce,Course not. It would take all the fun out of guessing.
Lyrics,<I>Don't know where it goes or where it leads</I>
Willow,"Angel stopped by? Wow. Was there... Well, I mean, was it having  to do with kissing?"
Buffy,"Willow, grow up. Not everything is about kissing."
Xander,(to Willow) Yeah. Some stuff's about groping. (to Buffy) It  wasn't about groping?
Buffy,"Okay, hormones on parade here? It was pure shoptalk. Remember  vampires, pointy teeth, they walk by night, am I ringing a bell?"
Willow,What did he say?
Buffy,"Oh, something's up. (closes her locker) Nothing I can't handle."
Xander,"Oh, hey, did you guys hear that Cibo Matto's gonna be at the  Bronze tonight?"
Willow,Cibo Matto? They're playing?
Xander,"No, Willow, they're gonna be clog dancing."
Willow,"Cibo Matto can clog dance? (gets a look from Xander) Oh,  sarcasm, right."
Xander,"We should attend, no?"
Cordelia,"Oh, look, it's the Three Musketeers."
Buffy,(to Xander) Was that an insult?
Xander,Kinda lacked punch.
Willow,The Three Musketeers were cool.
Cordelia,I see your point.
Xander,I woulda gone with Stooges.
Cordelia,"Well, I just meant that you guys always hang out together.  So, did you guys fight any demons this summer?"
Willow,"Uh, yes! Our own personal demons."
Xander,"Uh, such as, as, as lust and, uh, thrift!"
Buffy,I would have to go with Stooges also.
Cordelia,What are you guys talking about? I'm talking about big  squiggly demons that came from the ground? Remember? Prom night? With  all the vampires.
Buffy,"Cordelia, your mouth is open and sound is coming from it. This  is never good."
Xander,"No. (takes Cordelia aside) It's, see, we can't mention that  stuff in front of other people, Buffy being the Slayer and all."
Willow,"You haven't been talking about our little adventure all summer,  have you?"
Cordelia,"Are you nuts? Do you think I would tell people that I spent  the whole evening with you? Besides, it was all so creepy. That Master  guy? And all the screaming? I don't even like to think about it. (to  Buffy) So your secret's safe with me."
Buffy,"Well, that works out great. You won't tell anyone that I'm the  Slayer, and I won't tell anyone you're a moron. (leaves)"
Xander,"Now, that was a good insult."
Willow,A little too good.
Cordelia,What's up with her?
Lyrics,"<I>Don't, don't want the boys</I>"
Willow,I just think something's up is all.
Lyrics,"<I>Don't, don't note the heat</I>"
Xander,"Willow, you're paranoid."
Willow,Buffy's never acted like this before. Ever since she got back  she's... different.
Lyrics,<I>Can't find a spoon...</I>
Xander,Buffy's always been different.
Willow,She's never been mean.
Lyrics,<I>...that we have had</I>
Xander,(exhales) Any sign of her? She said she was coming.
Lyrics,<I>The sugar cubes...</I>
Willow,"No. The band's cool, though."
Xander,"Yeah, cool."
Lyrics,"<I>...can melt our mouth / We belong, yes, to-to-together</I>"
Lyrics,"<I>We belong, yes, to-to-together / We belong, yes, to-to-together</I>"
Xander,(looks at her) You got somethin' on your nose.
Lyrics,"<I>We belong, yes, to-to-together / We belong, yes, to-to-together</I>"
Lyrics,"<I>We belong, yes, to-to-together</I>"
Absalom,(to the other two) Don't just stand there. Dig! We have to  hurry.
Vampire,The ground is consecrated! It burns!
Collin,Dig.
Lyrics,<I>The velocity of time... turns her voice into... sugar water</I>
Buffy,Hi.
Angel,Hi.
Buffy,"So, is there danger at the Bronze? Should I beware?"
Angel,I can't help thinking I've done something to make you angry. And  that bothers me more than I'd like.
Buffy,I'm not angry. I don't know where that comes from.
Angel,What are you afraid of? Me? Us?
Buffy,"Could you contemplate getting over yourself for a second?  There's no 'us'. Look, Angel, I'm sorry if I was supposed to spend the  summer mooning over you, but I didn't. I moved on. To the living."
Lyrics,<I>I'm on a concrete way / The wind is blowing...</I>
Buffy,Hey!
Willow,Hi.
Xander,Hey.
Lyrics,<I>...to the north-northwest</I>
Willow,What's wrong with Angel?
Buffy,Beats me.
Lyrics,<I>It smells like sands of the southern island</I>
Buffy,(to Xander) Let's dance. (pulls at his shirt)
Xander,Ooo-kay. (is pulled by his shirt to the dance floor)
Lyrics,<I>When a black cat crosses my path</I>
Lyrics,"<I>A woman in the moon is singing to the earth / A woman in the  moon is singing to the earth / La la la, la la la la la la / La la la,  la la la la la la</I>"
Lyrics,"<I>La la la, la la la la la la / La la la, la la la la la la</I>"
Lyrics,<I>I'm riding on a camel that has big eyes / The buildings are  changing into coconut trees / Little by little</I>
Buffy,Xander? Did I ever thank you... for saving my life?
Lyrics,<I>When a black cat...</I>
Xander,No.
Lyrics,<I>...crosses my path</I>
Lyrics,<I>A woman in the moon is singing to the earth</I>
Buffy,Don't you wish I would?
Lyrics,<I>A woman in the moon is singing to the earth</I>
Lyrics,"<I>La la la, la la la la la la</I>"
Lyrics,"<I>La la la, la la la la la la</I>"
Cordelia,"Buffy. (Buffy stops) You're really campaigning for bitch-of- the-year, aren't you?"
Buffy,"(turns to face her) As defending champion, you nervous?"
Cordelia,"I can hold my own. You know, we've never really been close,  which is nice, 'cause I don't really like you that much, but... you have  on occasion saved the world and stuff, so I'm gonna... do you a favor."
Buffy,And this great favor is...
Cordelia,I'm gonna give you some advice. Get over it.
Buffy,Excuse me?
Cordelia,"Whatever is causing the Joan Collins 'tude, deal with it.  Embrace the pain, spank your inner moppet, whatever, but get over it.  'Cause pretty soon you're not even gonna have the loser friends you've  got now."
Buffy,I think it's about time you start minding your own business.
Cordelia,It's long past.
Buffy,(turns and goes) Nighty-night. (flips up her hood)
Cordelia,I'll just see if Angel feels like dancing.
Cordelia,"Ms., Ms. Calendar? Oh, God, Ms. Calendar?"
Willow,She's possessed!
Giles,Possessed?
Willow,"That's the only explanation that makes any sense. I mean, you  should've seen her last night. That wasn't Buffy."
Xander,Are we overlooking the idea that she may be very attracted to  me? (gets looks from the others and concedes) She's possessed.
Giles,Possessed by what?
Willow,Aaaaa possessing thing!
Giles,"(sarcastically) Well, that narrows it down."
Xander,"Well, you're the expert. Hey, maybe when the Master killed her  some... mystical bad guy transference thing happened."
Willow,"That's what it was! I mean, why else would she be acting like  such a b-i-t-c-h?"
Giles,"Willow, I think we're all a little too old to be spelling things  out."
Xander,A bitca?
Giles,"(not surprised by Xander's misunderstanding) Yes. I suggest  that, uh, the explanation for her behavior may be something more, more  mundane."
Giles,"(sits) She may simply have what you Americans refer to as  issues. Uh, her experience with the Master must have been extremely  traumatic. Well, she was, for at least a few minutes, technically dead.  (Buffy appears in the door) I-I don't think she's dealt with that on a  conscious level. (Xander notices Buffy) She's convinced herself that  she's invulnerable... for the very reason that she feels..."
Xander,"(interrupts) That's a very interesting point about trout, you  just brought up now."
Giles,"Trout? (notices Buffy) Trout! Yes, trout, i-is a fish. Good  morning. Did you sleep well?"
Buffy,Like a rock. Master's gone.
Giles,I'm sorry?
Buffy,"The Master. I went by his grave last night, and they have a  vacancy."
Giles,Good God!
Willow,What would somebody want with Master bones?
Xander,"A trophy, a horrible conversation piece?"
Buffy,"They're gonna bring him back. They're gonna bring the Master  back to life, and I seem to recall you telling me he was history."
Giles,"Buffy, I-I-I've never heard of a-a revivification ritual being  successful."
Buffy,But you've heard of them? Thanks for the warning.
Willow,"Well, Buffy, Giles did bury him and..."
Buffy,"Look, this is Slayer stuff, okay? Could we have just a little  less from the civilians, please?"
Xander,"Okay, that's just about enough!"
Snyder,(interrupts) I believe some of us have class? And some of us  have jobs.
Giles,"Y-yes, well, I'll, uh, I'll see you all, uh, in the library  later. We'll, we'll continue this discussion."
Willow,About trout.
Snyder,There're some things I can just smell. It's like a sixth sense.
Giles,"No, actually that would be one of the five."
Snyder,"That Summers girl. I smell trouble. I smell expulsion, and just  the faintest aroma of jail."
Giles,"Well, before you throw away the key, you might consider giving  her the benefit of the doubt. She may surprise you."
Snyder,"You really have faith in those kids, don't you?"
Giles,"Yes, I do."
Snyder,Weird.
Giles,"Alright, alright, I-I-I've got something. It's Latin, so bear  with me. Uh, to revive the vampire they need his bones, uh... w-which  they have, and, um, the blood... this is very unclear, of the closest  person... uh, someone connected to the vampire."
Buffy,That'd be me.
Giles,Perhaps.
Buffy,We were close. We killed each other. It really promotes  togetherness.
Xander,"Well, is there anything on when the ceremony might take..."
Xander,Whoa!
Buffy,"This is Cordelia's. (takes off the note) 'Come to the Bronze  before it opens, or we make her a meal.'"
Xander,They're gonna cook her dinner? (gets looks from everyone) I'll  pretend I didn't say that.
Willow,What do we do?
Buffy,(exhales) I go to the Bronze and save the day. (starts to go)
Xander,I don't like this.
Giles,Nor I!
Buffy,"(turns back) Yeah? Well, you guys aren't going."
Willow,What do you mean?
Buffy,I can't do it anymore. I can't look after the three of you guys  while I'm fighting.
Willow,"Well, what about the rest of the note?"
Buffy,What rest of the note?
Willow,"The part that says, 'P.S. This is a trap'?"
Giles,You'll be playing straight into their hands. (takes off his  glasses)
Buffy,I can handle this.
Willow,"Stop saying that! God, what's wrong with you?"
Xander,Cordelia may be dead.
Buffy,This is my fight.
Buffy,"Y'know, being stalked isn't really a big turn-on for girls."
Angel,(behind her) You need help. Someone to watch your back.
Buffy,Sure you don't mean my neck?
Angel,(comes around her) Why are you ridin' me?
Buffy,"Because I don't trust you. You're a vampire. (gets a look) Oh,  I'm sorry, was that an offensive term? Should I say 'undead American'?"
Angel,You have to trust someone. You can't do this alone.
Buffy,I trust me.
Angel,You're not as strong as you think.
Buffy,(gives him a challenging look) You think you can take me?
Angel,What?
Buffy,"Oh, c'mon! I mean, you must've thought about it. What would  happen if it ever came down to a fight, you vampire, me the Slayer, I  mean, you must've wondered! Well, why don't we find out?"
Angel,I'm not gonna fight you.
Buffy,Come on! Kick my ass!
Angel,Don't you have somewhere to be?
Buffy,I do.
Angel,"Well, you're wasting time."
Buffy,Just stay out of my way. (walks around him to the entrance)
Angel,Happy to oblige.
Buffy,That's not Cordelia.
Vampire,Cordelia couldn't make it.
Buffy,Where is she?
Vampire,I'm not supposed to tell.
Angel,I don't like this.
Buffy,Don't like what?
Angel,There's the bait. Where's the hook?
Buffy,You're right. Why would they send just one?
Willow,I still think we should've gone with her.
Xander,Buffy's about to lose it. I think we should be trying to reach  minimum safe distance.
Willow,"Xander, you know it's a trap!"
Giles,"Ah! Ah, ah, ah! Uh, uh, the Latin is, is translated from the  Sumerian, a-a-and rather badly. Closest to the Master actually  translates as 'nearest'. Physically. The, the, the person or persons who  were with him... when he... (looks up) It is a trap."
Giles,It just isn't for her.
Buffy,Watch her. Don't kill her unless you have to. (shoves her over  to Angel)
Angel,Buffy! What's goin' on?
Buffy,I'll be back.
Buffy,Xander!
Buffy,What happened?
Xander,(out of breath) Vampires. The ones you could handle yourself.
Buffy,Where are the others?
Xander,"I don't know. (angry) I don't know what your problem is, what  your issues are. But as of now, I officially don't care. If you'd worked  with us for five seconds, you coulda stopped this."
Buffy,"(turns away) We, we just have to think. Where would they have  taken them?"
Xander,"(vehemently) If they hurt Willow, I'll kill you."
Buffy,Why did they take them and not you?
Xander,"Giles said the ritual was, um... They needed people who were  close to the Master. Physically close. When he, uh..."
Buffy,The ones who were with the Master when he died.
Xander,"Giles, Willow, Cordelia..."
Buffy,Ms. Calendar.
Xander,Odds are they've got a complete set by now.
Buffy,We need to find out where.
Xander,How?
Buffy,One more time: where are they?
Vampire,You're too late. Your friends are dead.
Buffy,(lifts her back up) Tell me where they are!
Vampire,(laughs) What are you gonna do? Kill me?
Buffy,As a matter of fact...
Buffy,"...yes. (yanks off her necklace) But since I'm not gonna kill  you any time soon, the question becomes..."
Buffy,...how are we gonna pass the time till then?
Buffy,So. One more time.
Absalom,Begin.
Absalom,"Behold, these four mortals."
Absalom,Witnesses to our Master's wretched demise. They will breathe  their last this night. The blood that pours from their throats will  bring NEW LIFE to the old one. We gather for his resurrection. For the  dawn of this new hell.
Xander,(in a low voice) Buffy! Buffy! (she faces him) We gotta do  something now!
Buffy,You two get the others out of here.
Angel,We need you to distract the vampires.
Buffy,Right.
Xander,What are you gonna do?
Buffy,I'm gonna kill them all. (turns to her task) That oughta  distract them.
Absalom,For the old one. For his pain. For the dark.
Vampires,For the dark!
Absalom,The sacrifices! Stop them!
Giles,Are you alright?
Jenny,"Yeah, I'm okay."
Giles,Where's Buffy?
Xander,"Uh, she's working out her issues."
Absalom,ENOUGH!
Absalom,"Your day is done, girl. I'll grind you into a *sticky* paste,  and hear you beg before I smash in your face."
Buffy,"So, are you gonna kill me or are we just making small talk?"
Willow,It's over.
Xander,"No, it's not."
Angel,It's okay. It's okay.
Cordelia,What an ordeal. And you know what the worst part is?
Jenny,What?
Cordelia,"It stays with you forever. No matter what they tell you, none  of that rust and blood and grime comes out. I mean, you can dry clean  till judgment day, you are living with those stains."
Jenny,Yeah that's the worst part of being hung upside down by a  vampire who wants to slit your throat: the stains.
Cordelia,I hear ya!
Buffy,I don't think I can face them.
Giles,"Hmm? Of course, you can."
Buffy,I can't! What am I supposed say? 'Sorry I almost got your throat  slit. What's the homework?'
Giles,Punishing yourself like this is pointless.
Buffy,It's entirely pointy. I was a moron. I put my best friends in  mortal danger on the second day of school.
Giles,What are you gonna do? Crawl inside a cave for the rest of your  life?
Buffy,Would it have cable?
Giles,"Buffy, you acted wrongly, I admit that. But believe me, that was  hardly the, the worst mistake you'll ever make. Uh, that wasn't quite as  comforting as it was meant to be."
Buffy,"Well, points for effort. (the bell rings) See ya."
Willow,"Hey, Buffy."
Buffy,Hey.
Willow,We saved you a seat.
Xander,"There's a rumor going around that, uh, Mr. Cox is the most  boring teacher in the entire world. Like, I think he won a belt or  something."
Buffy,"Like, yes."
Willow,"Well, I hear he nods off a lot. So that's a plus."
Xander,"So, we Bronzin' it tonight?"
Willow,"Wednesday, it's kinda beat."
Xander,"Well, we could grind our enemies into talcum powder with a  sledgehammer, but, gosh, we did that last night."
Xander,"Hey, I got a plan: how 'bout miniature golf."
Willow,There's no course here.
Xander,"Okay, uh, miniature tennis! A very tiny form of tennis that we  could invent..."
Collin,I hate that girl.
