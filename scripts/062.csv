Willow,"The bronze is more fun this year, isn't it?"
Oz,Yeah. Curfew-free nights of mom and popless hootenanny.
Xander,"Coed dating prospects who find townies sexy and dangerous. What, I can dream."
Willow,Because the bronze is nice and familiar. It's like a big comfy blanky.
Oz,I was under the impression that I was your big comfy blanky.
Giles,Hello.
Buffy,"Giles, trouble?"
Buffy,"So much for your predictable blanky theory, Will."
Buffy,"Yes, but it's your cutting edge 8-tracks that keep you ahead of the scene."
Oz,"Don't scoff, gang. I've seen Giles' collection. He was an animal in his day."
Giles,Thank you.
Buffy,"Hey, why not? If the stones can still keep rolling, why can't Giles?"
Giles,Exactly.
Willow,I think it's brave that you're here.
Giles,"Well, thank you, all. You've made me feel right at home."
Xander,Isn't home that empty place you're trying to escape?
Giles,"Oh, yeah."
Willow,Veruca's playing tonight.
Oz,Yeah. Every Wednesday. I told you.
Buffy,"So, Oz, what about dingoes? When are you guys here again?"
Oz,"(Distractedly.) Oh, we're up next friday."
Willow,"They're good, aren't they?"
Oz,Nothing special.
Willow,Yeah. She's quell fiona. Color me bored.
Giles,Really? I think she's rather remarkable. Such presence for someone her age.
Oz,Now you're faking.
Willow,(In a cute voice.) Am not. Just a little. (She turns to face Oz.
Oz,Morning.
Willow,Morning.
Oz,Bad dream?
Willow,I guess. But the waking up part makes up for it.
Oz,It's always so busy in there.
Willow,Not always. A few things shut my brain up completely. (Gets cuddly.)
Oz,Anything I can help you with?
Willow,"I gotta get to class right now, but tonight for sure."
Oz,"I don't know about tonight, unless the extreme jerry garcia look turns you on."
Willow,(Confused.) Huh?
Oz,Night before the full moon.
Oz,No. Go. Show 'em how it's done.
Willow,Are you sure? You can lock yourself up? It's only this one month.
Oz,I'll be fine.
Willow,Ok. As long as you don't mind.
Oz,The only thing I mind is being away from you for 3 nights.
Walsh,Ms. Summers... I want you to prepare to lead a discussion group next class
Buffy,(Surprised as she recives her paper.) What do I have to do?
Walsh,"If you have any questions, bring them up with one of the T.A.S."
Buffy,I know. Can you believe it?
Willow,Wow. I guess professor Walsh isn't so ogrey after all.
Buffy,"Great. I'm T.A. Bound right now, and then I will catch up with you guys."
Willow,Cool.
Veruca,"What are you gonna do, sit on the ground?"
Oz,My girlfriend's coming.
Veruca,There's room.
Oz,(Sits down.) Big lunch?
Oz,(Nods.) Agreed. You guys were tight last night.
Oz,What are you using? 50 Or 120?
Willow,(Walks up. Looks somewhat distressed.) Hey.
Oz,Hey.
Veruca,Hey.
Willow,"Music talk, huh? Cool. I love to listen to oz talk about the biz."
Veruca,What do you like again? I know you told me.
Oz,There's a couple good ones. The johnson mil... The number one is redbone.
Veruca,Number one? No. I gotta go with hound dog.
Willow,"Me, too. That's a great song. I mean, elvis, what a guy."
Veruca,You a big elvis fan?
Willow,"The biggest. Well, I mean, after dingoes, of course."
Willow,Oh. Ha ha.
Oz,"You know, I gotta bail. Um, I'll call you later. (He gets up to go.)"
Veruca,"I should go, too. (To Willow.) Good shirt. (She leaves.)"
Buffy,(Walks up.) Check out the rapid exits. Was it me?
Buffy,It doesn't mean anything. So Oz checks out another girl. He loves you.
Willow,You think?
Oz,"That was, um..."
Veruca,Some night.
Oz,So it appears.
Oz,So you're A...
Veruca,Werewolf groupie. Nobody else gets it done for me.
Oz,What?
Oz,Not a possibility.
Veruca,So what do you want to do?
Veruca,(Incredulous.) You have a cage?
Oz,Don't you?
Oz,It's my choice. I don't wanna hurt anybody.
Oz,"Well, I am. I'm only a wolf 3 nights a month."
Oz,"I'm going. I gotta check the paper, see if we did any damage last night."
Oz,We aren't going to. This ends... Right now.
Oz,Free to kill people? I won't do that. You shouldn't.
Veruca,You don't understand. But you will. You'll see that we belong together.
Oz,No. I know where I belong.
Veruca,(As Oz walks of.) See ya tonight.
Walsh,2 Of them. It was unbelievable. The fact that I survived at all is a miracle.
Buffy,(Walks up to them.) Excuse me. Ms. Walsh?
Buffy,Wild dogs?
Buffy,"No. No, I was just... Sayin' howdy."
Walsh,Fine. See you in class.
Oz,Yeah?
Willow,(Walks in.) Hey.
Oz,Hey. New look. (She's wearing shiny pants.)
Willow,"You, too."
Oz,Oh. Uh... Laundry day kinda came and went.
Willow,Hey... I'm sorry if I was weird yesterday with you and Veruca.
Oz,(Looking mildly uncomfortable.) I didn't notice anything.
Willow,Really? 'Cause I felt all spazzy.
Oz,No.
Oz,"Well, now you can stop everything's fine."
Oz,What? (He's very uncomfortable as she approaches him.)
Willow,What's wrong?
Oz,Uh...Sorry. I...
Willow,You don't want to? (She looks hurt.)
Oz,"It's not that. I do. I just... I didn't get any sleep, I guess. I'm really beat."
Willow,Right. Busy wolf night. I get it. It's totally ok.
Oz,"(As Willow heads for the door.) Willow, you don't have to--"
Willow,No. I--I should. I don't have much time. See you later.
Giles,(Answering the tv.) Peace of westphalia.
Giles,"Oh, you moron. That dinette set should be mine."
Giles,"Buffy. Excellent. Uh, come in."
Buffy,Hi.
Buffy,"Pass on the tea. And the moose, thank you."
Giles,"You come on business, I hope?"
Buffy,"(Giving him a look.) Yes. Lucky for you, people may be in danger."
Giles,"(Embarrased.) I only meant, uh, that I'm at the ready."
Giles,Werewolves. Two Of them?
Giles,Have you spoken with Oz?
Buffy,My next stop.
Giles,Right. Get right on it.
Buffy,And I'll see what I can find out.
Giles,And you report back to me...
Buffy,(As she leaves.) Asap. Promise.
Xander,"Hey, Will. Mom let you in?"
Willow,She seemed cranky.
Willow,How come? (She sits on the arm of the couch.)
Willow,Yeah. Parents usually wait till you're out of the house. Or under it.
Xander,Or under it...
Willow,To start worrying about stuff like that.
Xander,"Well, last time I checked, I had the creds. Hit me."
Willow,What does it mean when a girl wants to... You know.
Xander,"If you're doin' it, I think you should be able to say it."
Willow,Make love.
Xander,Wild monkey love or tender Sarah Mclachlan love?
Willow,"Well, say the girl's been noticing--"
Xander,"Will, I've deciphered your ingenious code."
Willow,Ok. Say I've been noticing Oz notice someone else. A woman.
Xander,And is this chick noticing back?
Willow,Most definitely.
Xander,Well... Have you asked Oz about it?
Willow,"Well, I thought about it, but then he'll think I'm all jealous and worry."
Buffy,"Got out, huh?"
Oz,Yeah.
Buffy,Any news about attacks?
Oz,No.
Buffy,But I did hear about a woman being chased by two wild dogs.
Oz,Two? Really?
Buffy,"You don't remember anything like that, do you? Another wolf?"
Oz,"No. When the change comes, it's like...I'm gone. Total blackout."
Oz,I'm ok. Thanks.
Oz,Come here.
Oz,You'll be safe.
Oz,I feel it.
Oz,(Tensely.) Come in here.
Veruca,Did you?
Oz,Willow... (He starts putting on his pants.)
Willow,"Oh, my god. Oh, my god."
Oz,I know what you saw. It wasn't-- (Finishes putting on his pants.) I had to.
Willow,I bet.
Oz,She's like me. A wolf.
Oz,She was gonna hurt somebody. I didn't have a choice.
Veruca,"(Having woken up, stands up bearing all.) Girl's got a point."
Oz,(Angrily.) Leave.
Veruca,I'm just saying--
Oz,(Shouts) Now! I'm sorry. I know.
Oz,I know how it feels. I remember.
Willow,"Oh. So what, this is payback? I had this coming?"
Oz,No. It's not--
Oz,"No. I could sense something, but..."
Oz,Willow!
Buffy,"Willow, are you ok? (To Riley.) Thank you. I was too far away."
Riley,It was lucky. She almost got hit.
Buffy,"Willow, what's the matter?"
Buffy,Thank you.
Buffy,"I have to go. I have to find Veruca before the sun sets. I will, though."
Willow,No.
Willow,Uh-huh. Ok.
Buffy,You're ok?
Willow,I'm fine. I promise.
Buffy,I love you. (Buffy leaves.)
Willow,Put the blame where it belongs.
Oz,"So you haven't seen her around? (Pause.) Ok. Thanks, man."
Buffy,Where is she?
Buffy,"We'll try that, then."
Oz,"Look, buffy, you should know that--"
Buffy,Oz... (Coldly.) Now might be a good time for your trademark stoicism.
Willow,"I conjure thee by barabbas, by satanas, and the devil. As thou art burning,"
Buffy,Or the dirty pile of clothing she left on the ground.
Oz,"Well, they could be from the other night when she-- Turned into a werewolf. U"
Buffy,Unless she wanted to throw you off the scent.
Oz,Willow.
Willow,"Let this image seal his fate, not to love, only hate."
Willow,(Backing up.) You don't know what I have. You don't know anything about me.
Veruca,I know what you love. I have his scent on me right now.
Oz,Don't touch her again.
Veruca,"Come stop me. I like it rough, remember?"
Oz,"You wanna hurt me, hurt me. You leave her out of this."
Oz,You don't wanna find out what I am.
Veruca,You're an animal. Animals kill.
Oz,You're right. (Advancing towards her.) We kill.
Willow,Oz?
Giles,I'm not quite sure I understand.
Giles,"Well, this fellow in the woods, he was in military garb?"
Giles,You saved Willow.
Giles,"You've... You've felt that way yourself, And you got through it."
Giles,Fair enough.
Buffy,I just don't know how they're gonna deal with this.
Willow,(Walks in.) Hello.
Oz,Hi.
Willow,What are you doing?
Oz,I'm going.
Willow,Now?
Oz,Mm-hmm.
Willow,That's your solution?
Oz,That's my decision.
Willow,Don't I get any say in this?
Oz,I'll find someplace.
Willow,"Well, how long?"
Oz,I don't know.
Willow,Oz... Don't you love me?
Willow,"Oz... Oh, god. Oz..."
