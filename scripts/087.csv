GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
DREG,"This dark spell I hold in my worthless hand is our gift to you, Glorificus..."
GLORY,"(trying on a shoe) Please, call me Glory."
TARA,What if she's something else altogether?
GILES,"Something new, you mean?"
TARA,(shakes head) Something old. So old it pre-dates the written word.
SECURITY GUARD,"Lady, whatever you are, please ... I have two daughters."
MONK,The key ... is energy. My brethren sent it to you.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,Dawn.
GILES,She has no idea.
BUFFY,No. She thinks she's my kid sister.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,I have to take care of her.
DOCTOR,Your mother has ... low-grade glioma. It's a brain tumor.
Episode begins,A tray of hospital food. A hand picks up a piece of green Jello. Pull back to discover Joyce and Dawn sitting in the hospital bed while Buffy sits beside the bed. Joyce has a bandage on her forehead. Dawn is eating green Jello with her fingers.
JOYCE,"Listen you two, I know this creamed spinach is pretty delicious, but I promise, I won't be offended if you go out for some real food."
BUFFY,You kidding me? This is the good life. Relaxing in bed while people bring you food on trays.
DAWN,(licking fingers) I like the Jello.
JOYCE,(laughs) Help yourself. There's something about food that moves by itself that gives me the heebie-jeebies.
DAWN,"It's good and wiggly. (speaks with mouth full) This girl at school told me that gelatin is made from ground-up cow's feet, and that if you eat Jello there's some cows out limping with no feet."
DAWN,But I told her I'm sure they kill 'em before they take off their feet. (Suddenly nervous) Right?
BUFFY,(to Joyce) You're the one who insisted on teaching her to talk.
JOYCE,"Oh, hello, Dr. Kriegel, um, you know my girls, (gestures to them) Buffy and Dawn."
DR. KRIEGEL,"Yes, of course. You two are becoming part of the regular crew around here."
BUFFY,Just keeping her company.
DR. KRIEGEL,Good. Just be careful you don't wear her out.
JOYCE,"Ohh, don't worry about that. I woke up exhausted, there's really no more exhausted to get."
DR. KRIEGEL,"Well, maybe some good news will help. The blood work's come back from the lab, and everything seems fine. So, we've scheduled your surgery for day after tomorrow at ten in the morning."
DR. KRIEGEL,How's that sound to you?
JOYCE,"Oh, well, I think they had me scheduled for volleyball, but, ah, we can work around it."
DR. KRIEGEL,"(laughs) All right. Joyce, you take care. Make sure you get some good solid rest. And I mean that. (Exits)"
JOYCE,"Uhh, the day after tomorrow. I don't think I can stand to stay here another two days just waiting."
BUFFY,"Waiting? Gimme a break, we got, we got tons to do."
DAWN,We have soap operas to watch and trashy magazines to read.
BUFFY,And an adjustable bed to fiddle with. That alone will keep me busy for four hours or so.
JOYCE,"Oh, I really don't need you to stay here, Buffy. I know you've got patrolling to do."
BUFFY,"Not tonight. Tonight I have mom-taking-care-of to do. And besides, Riley's filling in for me with the others. I'm sure they have everything under control."
Cut to,"graveyard, night. Giles has a dark-haired female vampire in a choke-hold from behind while Willow attacks from the front. The vampire shoves Willow away and twists out of Giles' grip."
XANDER,Human chest! Human chest!
GILES,Sorry!
GILES,"My god, what a rough night."
WILLOW,"(giggling, grabbing at Xander) I just did two of 'em! Yay on me! (giggles in exhilaration)"
WILLOW,That was pretty cool. Except the part where I was all terrified and ... and now my knees are all dizzy.
XANDER,Not so much a big success night for me. (They resume walking as Giles begins cleaning his glasses on his shirt) But I think I should get points just for showing up. Unlike some Riley Finn who shall remain unnamed.
GILES,"Yes, that was disappointing. Things would have been easier if he'd been here. (Puts glasses on)"
WILLOW,"Oh, piffle, who needs him when I'm dusting two at a ti- (She suddenly staggers and they catch her, each grabbing an arm) Whoops. (smiles nervously at Xander) Maybe it would've been good if ... he'd shown up."
GILES,Perhaps he forgot.
Cut to,"exterior shot of an alley, doorway of what could be an abandoned warehouse."
WILLOW,"Care package! Special delivery for the Summers girls. (Puts the bag on the bed next to Joyce. Dawn comes running over, as Buffy follows more slowly) Now, let's see what I have in this sack of mine. Oh, I feel just like Santa Claus, except thinner and younger and female and, well, Jewish. (Joyce smiles as Willow reaches into the bag) This (to Dawn) is an extra-special gift for your mom, that I know she'll need. (pulls it out) A beer hat! See, i-it's got cup holders, and a straw that goes directly into your mouth, and (to Joyce) you can fill it with other stuff than beer. And somehow, when I was in the store this seemed like the most important idea (Buffy and Dawn smile at each other. Buffy is holding a cup) and now there's the whole part where I'm crazy."
JOYCE,"It's perfect. Thank you, Willow. You're very sweet."
WILLOW,"Now, let's see, who's next? Dawn, I believe I have something in here for you..."
BUFFY,(quietly) Headache?
JOYCE,"Just a little one. (smiles) A biggish little one. (Willow stops going through the bag, looks concerned) I'm fine! Go on, what else is in that sack of goodies, Willow?"
WILLOW,"All right. Dawn, to keep you busy."
DAWN,"Ooh, spells! Thank you, Willow!"
BUFFY,"You got her a book on spells. (Willow stops smiling) The girl who can break things by just looking at them, now has a book to teach her to ... break things by looking at them?"
WILLOW,"Oh, well, it doesn't actually have spells in it. Just history, and anecdotes, stuff like that."
WILLOW,"Oh, Buffy- (reaches into bag) I have this for you. (Pulls out a large textbook called ""World History"" and gives it to Buffy)"
BUFFY,Homework? (pouts) Oh. I don't believe in tiny Jewish Santa any more.
WILLOW,(smiling) And a yo-yo. (Pulls yo-yo out of bag and gives it to Buffy)
BUFFY,(smiling) Thank you.
WILLOW,The book is just in case you get a chance to look it over.
WILLOW,"(OS) We're doing World War One now. The last exam was really pretty easy, just underlying causes and trench foot. So it should be no hassle to make it up-"
BUFFY,(sighs) I don't even know if I'm gonna take that exam.
JOYCE,(scowling) I'd rip it in half and stick it in bed with me!
BUFFY,(tentatively) Mom?
JOYCE,"You know, I think I'm gonna take a little rest now."
BUFFY,Okay. We'll be right outside if you need us.
DAWN,"(to Willow) What was she talking about? I mean, that was weird."
WILLOW,She's gonna be fine.
BUFFY,"(joins them) It's okay. I'm sorry, the doctor spoke to me, and uh, I should have told you. Um, the, the thing that's pressing on her brain, sometimes it, it might make her say weird things."
DAWN,Does she know she's saying them?
BUFFY,"Not really. It's sort of like a flash, you know, but you saw her two seconds afterward. She was normal."
WILLOW,"And after the operation, no more pressing. She'll be all normal all the time."
DAWN,(to Buffy) Is that right?
BUFFY,"Hey, Santa doesn't lie."
BUFFY,"Oh, excuse me."
MAN,"Careful, the facts say a-a picnic is in order."
GUARD,What is that thing?
GUARD,There-there's no data. There's no pictures on this one there!
GUARD,What is the data? (scared) There's no one in there.
DAWN,(scared) Buffy?
BUFFY,"(grabs Dawn and turns her away) Come on, honey. Don't worry about it."
GUARD,"I'm going home? (Wife nods) Home? Home, home, home."
DAWN,What's wrong with him? (Shot of the guard being led away by his wife and daughters) Is it like Mom? A thing in his head?
BUFFY,"(staring after the guard) I don't think so, I-I think it's, it's different. Don't, don't worry about it. (Brushes hair back from Dawn's face)"
BEN,"I guess I missed that, was he bothering you?"
BUFFY,"Hey Ben, uh, this is my friend Willow."
BEN,Hi.
WILLOW,Hi. (They shake hands)
BUFFY,"And, uh, yeah, the crazy man was a little ... you know, crazy, but it's okay. (Dawn still looks shaken) Are they really gonna send him home?"
BEN,"Don't get me started. The mental ward's booked beyond capacity, literally nowhere to put them, so the ones with families, they're letting 'em go home. Like his family's gonna be able to take care of him. He has to have someone to watch him 24-7! (looks at Dawn) What was he saying to you?"
DAWN,I-
BUFFY,"Oh, he was just babbling."
Cut to,"aerial shot of  Sunnydale, night. Pan across roofs and treetops."
Cut to,"roof of a UCS dorm building. Willow and Tara are lying side-by-side on their backs on a sleeping bag, with pillows under their heads and another sleeping bag covering them."
WILLOW,You know what's weird?
TARA,Japanese commercials are weird.
WILLOW,"Yes. And also, you know some of the stars we're looking at ... don't even exist any more? In the time that it takes for their light to reach us, they've died. Exploded. (Tara turns her head to look at Willow) Poof."
TARA,"Were, um ... were things rough at the hospital?"
WILLOW,"You know, I used to love to look up at them when I was little. They're supposed to make you feel all insignificant, but ... they made me feel like ... like I was in space ... part of the stars. (points) There's ... Canis Minor ... and ... (points) and Cassiopeia."
TARA,"(smiles, points) And the big pineapple."
WILLOW,"Hmm. You know, I'm not sure I remember that one."
TARA,"Oh, it's, it's a major one. (points) See those three bright stars right over there?"
WILLOW,Yeah.
TARA,And see those stars along there? (Shot of the stars) That's the bottom of the pineapple.
WILLOW,It's big.
TARA,"Hence the name. (pause) The real ones never made sense to me, I ... sort of have my own."
WILLOW,Teach me.
TARA,"(points) See those stars over there? ""Short man looking uncomfortable."""
TARA,"Uh... (points) ""Moose getting a sponge bath."" Umm... ""little pile o'crackers."" (Willow frowns) Tha-that was a bit of a stretch. (They both laugh) You do it. What would you call ... mm, that one? (points)"
WILLOW,"Hmm, let's see."
WILLOW,A huge flaming meteor about to crash into something!
Cut to,"Darkness. Bits of flaming rubble slowly appear as we see from the perspective of something digging its way out of something. The camera moves jerkily as the something looks around, finds itself in a trench carved by the passage of the meteor. Our perspective rises as we climb up out of the trench and find rocky earth, surrounded by trees. In the distance we see the security guard walking toward us, alone."
GUARD,(muttering to himself) I know what I said. I said-I said I won't go away far. A person needs to respect a man.
GUARD,And then it says ... that... the facts says... he's got to go take a walk and get some fresh air and find some fresh spaces.
GUARD,...and some fresh space! And needs to walk to get ... to get where he's going.
Cut to,"Joyce in her hospital bed, holding the nurse call button, pushing the button again and again."
JOYCE,(irritated) This thing doesn't work! It isn't working!
BUFFY,I'm sure they heard you. (Takes the call button from Joyce and puts it aside. We see Dawn in the background reading.)
JOYCE,I bet it's not even hooked up to anything. Just like the push buttons at the crosswalk that are supposed to make the signal change.
BUFFY,"I'm sure someone's on - What, the push buttons aren't hooked up to anything?"
JOYCE,"Oh, tell him, Buffy. Tell him, okay?"
BUFFY,"Look, Dr. Kriegel, we wanna go home."
DR. KRIEGEL,"Well, of course. You can come back and visit your mother first thing in the morning."
BUFFY,"No. We. I-I mean, all of us. My mom too."
DR. KRIEGEL,"Oh. Well, I understand that, but it's not necessarily the first thing I'd recommend."
JOYCE,"I can't! I-I can't stay here waiting for two days for this operation, I just can't. (Doctor sighs) It makes my head hurt to be here, can't you tell that?"
DR. KRIEGEL,"Joyce, there's no reason to get upset."
JOYCE,"No reason to get upset? Oh, right, sorry, I must just think there is because of my brain tumor!"
BUFFY,"Here, Dawn, why don't you get something from the machine?"
JOYCE,"(softly to Buffy) I-I'm sorry I said that, I'm just tired."
BUFFY,"I know. Listen, Doctor, I don't see why we can't take her home, you know, just until... (gestures) I-I mean, wouldn't it be better for her to rest someplace where she felt safe and comfortable?"
DR. KRIEGEL,"Even if it would mean some work for you, taking care of her?"
JOYCE,"(sighs and leans back in bed) Oh, thank god."
BUFFY,"I'll do it, anything."
DR. KRIEGEL,"(sighs, shakes his head) There are medications to administer, I'd have to go over those with you, and I'd need for you to check her vitals, watch her pretty closely. I'm afraid you won't get a lot of sleep."
BUFFY,(shrugs) I'm not much of a sleep person anyway.
JOYCE,(anxiously) Can we go now? (starts to get out of bed) Let's go now!
BUFFY,"Oh, hold on! (stops her) Lemme get all the medications and all the instructions on how to do everything."
DR. KRIEGEL,She's right. Let's do this right. We don't wanna forget anything.
Cut to,"Dawn sitting in the hallway reading her book. Shot of her from overhead, in the alien creature's point of view. Shot of Dawn reading as we see the creature crawling along the ceiling above her head."
Cut to,"Willow and Tara walking through forest, night. Then we see Riley, Xander, Anya, and Giles walking behind them. Giles has a flashlight."
RILEY,Everyone stay close. (to Xander) I'm glad you called me in on this.
XANDER,Glad you answered.
RILEY,"Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about last time. Heard I missed out on some fun."
XANDER,"Oh, yeah, fun was had. Also frolic, merriment, and near-death hijinks."
RILEY,"Look, there it is. (Pushes past Willow and Tara)"
WILLOW,Wow. We have meteorite.
ANYA,Is it hot?
ANYA,"'Cause, uh, if there's radiation, you could like go all sterile."
RILEY,"No, it's not hot. It's warm. And broken. (Kneels to look at it. Everyone stares.) It's sort of-"
GILES,Hollow.
RILEY,Yeah.
ANYA,"So, uh, we're all thinking the same thing, right?"
XANDER,Festive pinata? Delicious candy?
WILLOW,Something evil crashed to earth in this and then broke out and ... slithered away to do badness.
GILES,"In all fairness, we don't really know about the slithered part."
ANYA,"Oh, no. I'm sure it frisked about like a fluffy lamb."
TARA,Let's look around. Maybe we can figure out where it went.
WILLOW,It went here!
RILEY,No pulse.
ANYA,"Yep, the space lamb got 'im. (Giles gives her a disgusted look)"
XANDER,I don't see any marks on him.
WILLOW,"I-I know him! He, he was at the hospital, a mental patient. They released him today."
GILES,"Uh, Riley, what are you doing?"
RILEY,"I'm not sure, there's something..."
RILEY,"Oh, that might be toxic, don't touch it."
XANDER,"Oh yeah, touching it was my first impulse. Luckily I've moved on to my second, which involves dry-heaving and running like hell. (straightens up) Oh, man, does that smell."
ANYA,So what do we do now?
WILLOW,We can't call Buffy. (beat) I wanna call Buffy!
TARA,You can't. She's got ... life stuff. That has to come first.
WILLOW,"So, so we'll just figure this out ourselves. We're experienced."
ANYA,"Yes, 'cause it seems like we're always dealing with creatures from outer space. Except that we don't ever do that."
RILEY,(gets up) This is definitely new territory.
GILES,"Perhaps we should explore a bit more, head into the woods a bit."
XANDER,Who votes research?
WILLOW,Research.
RILEY,"Yeah, I think that's a good call. There could have been some other cases like this. I'm gonna stay here, examine the body some more, look around a little bit."
XANDER,"Yeah, don't do anything hunterly."
RILEY,"No, no, I'm just not great at research, which I'm sure you guys figured out. I like me a good crime scene."
GILES,"Um, give us a call if you need help."
RILEY,"Believe me, something jumps out at me in the dark ... you'll hear me even without the phone. Call me if you learn anything."
WILLOW,You got it.
WILLOW,(to Giles) I don't wanna be the one who finds the bodies any more.
RILEY,"I need to speak to the man at the desk. This is A ... this is Riley Finn. You have an Agent Miller, Graham Miller, he'll tell you who ... Yes. Emergency frequency."
PATIENT,Cold. Cold.
PATIENT,Wait! You can't go! (snorts) Don't you be that kind of barn owl! (Nurse continues walking away) Please! Please don't go! Please!
PATIENT,Please! Please! Please don't-
PATIENT,I can't see you! I can't see you! I can't see you!
DR. KRIEGEL,"Well, I guess we're all set then."
DR. KRIEGEL,"You've got my home phone number, pager number, and here, these are the medications I talked to you about. The sedative and so forth, painkillers."
BUFFY,Right. No problem.
DR. KRIEGEL,"Now, if this is gonna be too much for you, we can make your mom perfectly comfortable here."
BUFFY,"No. No, no, I-I got this. We really, really appreciate-"
JOYCE,(to Buffy) You look just like your father when he cries.
BUFFY,(to doctor) I-I told you she's been-
DR. KRIEGEL,I know. Joyce? (Joyce is staring dazedly at Buffy) Joyce. (She looks at him) We're all done here. Why don't you take your girls home now.
JOYCE,"Yes. Yes, thank you. Thank you for all your help, doctor."
DR. KRIEGEL,I'll see you in a couple of days.
JOYCE,"Oh, let's get the hell outta here."
Cut to,"overhead shot of Sunnydale, night."
Cut to,inside foyer of the Summers house. The door opens and Buffy enters followed by Joyce and Dawn.
BUFFY,Here we go.
JOYCE,"Oh, it's nice to be home."
DAWN,"Do you wanna go in to bed, Mom?"
JOYCE,"Buffy, no, that light is too bright. It's too bright."
BUFFY,"Oh, okay, okay!"
JOYCE,"It's too bright. Buffy, it hurts. It hurts, it hurts my eyes."
BUFFY,"It's off, it's off. You know what, (to Dawn) why don't you turn off the lights in the living room, (to Joyce) and I will take you upstairs and we'll shut off all the lights up there. Okay? Come on."
ELLIS,You Finn?
RILEY,Yeah.
ELLIS,"Major Ellis. I'm in charge of this op. (Shakes Riley's hand) What's the situation, just the one civilian casualty?"
RILEY,That I know of. This way.
GRAHAM,You found a stiff in the woods and called us in? Don't you usually call your girlfriend for this kind of thing?
RILEY,I wouldn't touch that stuff in his mouth if I were you.
ELLIS,Toxic?
RILEY,"No, just messy. (Ellis stands) Guy seemed to have simply choked on the stuff. (Tosses Ellis a small vial) Near as I can tell, it's some kind of protein alkaloid."
ELLIS,Does this fit the profile of any Sub-T you're familiar with?
RILEY,"Not subterrestrial, Major. Extraterrestrial. (Leads them to the rock at the end of the trench) It came outta that."
ELLIS,"Miller, set the trackers for a protein signature."
GRAHAM,Yes sir.
RILEY,"No good, Major. This alkaloid's breaking down at an accelerated rate. It's dissolving too fast to track."
ELLIS,You got a better idea?
RILEY,Thing came from space. Gotta be some trace radiation.
ELLIS,We have Geiger counters in the packs.
RILEY,Shouldn't be too much background gamma noise out here.
ELLIS,Break 'em out.
Cut to,"exterior of the Summers house, still dark except the porch light."
Cut to,"Buffy and Dawn on the living room sofa, watching TV. Dawn rests her head on Buffy's shoulder. Canned laughter from the TV."
DAWN,Mom?
BUFFY,"Oh, my-"
BUFFY,"Mom, wha-what are you doing?"
JOYCE,"(angrily) I'm making breakfast. (closes fridge, looks Buffy up and down) And you shouldn't eat any more, you're disgustingly fat."
JOYCE,"Oh, Buffy, I don't know what I'm doing."
BUFFY,You just need some rest. We'll put you back to bed.
BUFFY,"Okay,  here we go. (Takes glass from Joyce) That will help you sleep. Come on, let's get you all tucked into bed."
JOYCE,Don't touch me! You - you thing!
DAWN,"(backing up) Mom, please!"
JOYCE,"Get away from me! (Buffy comes over and Dawn gives her an anxious look) You're nothing, you're, you're a shadow!"
BUFFY,Mom-
JOYCE,I don't know what you are or how you got here!
BUFFY,"Mom, it's Dawn."
JOYCE,"Dawn? Honey, what's wrong?"
BUFFY,"She's .. just tired. We all are. (She coaxes Joyce to lie down, which Joyce does, looking worried) Come on, go to sleep. I'll check in on you in a little bit. (Exits)"
DAWN,(teary) She hates me.
BUFFY,(kneeling beside the bed) No.
DAWN,She called me a thing.
BUFFY,She loves you. Okay? She's not herself. (puts her hand on Dawn's) I told you what the doctor said about the tumor.
DAWN,"(shakes head) No, not just Mom. People. They keep saying weird stuff about me."
BUFFY,Are you talking about the man in the hospital?
DAWN,He called me a thing too. And there was another one. Weird guy outside the magic shop. (Buffy looks concerned) He said I didn't belong. He said I wasn't real. (Buffy sighs) Why does everybody keep doing that? What's wrong with me?
BUFFY,"Nothing. It's not you. I think there's something that happens in people's brains when there's something wrong. It's, it's like a short-circuit ... and it makes them feel like nothing's real except for them. That's all it is."
BUFFY,"Look, it is not you. (Gets up to sit on the bed next to Dawn) Okay? And if anyone says anything like that to you again, don't listen. Even if it's Mom."
DAWN,(softly) I hate it.
BUFFY,I know. (puts her hand on Dawn's shoulder) Just don't listen.
Cut to,"Xander staring at a small model of the solar system, which is hanging above his head. Behind him we see Giles and Willow sitting at a table covered with books. There are bookshelves everywhere."
XANDER,"Look at how teeny Mercury is compared to, like, Saturn. Whereas in contrast, the cars of the same name-"
GILES,"Xander, please, we have work to do here."
XANDER,(walks toward them) I still don't get why we had to come here to get info about a killer snot monster. (Sits)
GILES,Because it's a killer snot monster from outer space. (Pauses) I did not say that.
GILES,"(in lecture voice) Demons enter our world in all sorts of ways, this one came from above."
XANDER,"And the university library's astronomy section is the home of aboveness. Got it. Hey, take in the study material, too. (Holds up a book titled ""Meteors and You!"")"
TARA,We've been scouring all the international periodicals for any other meteorite landings in the last week.
ANYA,Big zippo. (Sits)
GILES,"Well, then it would appear that the world is not being invaded."
TARA,I'm pretty pleased about that.
WILLOW,"Uh, guys? I've got some stuff. (Everyone looks at her.) The most recent meteoric anomaly was the Tunguska blast in Russia in 1917. (Giles gets up to come behind her and look at the screen) Some witnesses claimed the meteor was hollow."
XANDER,Hmm. Maybe with a chewy demon center like ours.
GILES,How far back does this list of anomalies go?
WILLOW,Pretty far. Back to the Queller impact in the twelfth century.
TARA,The what?
WILLOW,"Queller. I-I don't know why they call it that, it didn't hit a place called Queller or anything. It landed just outside of Reykjavik in Iceland."
XANDER,"Wait, I just saw... (flipping pages) Queller. Quell ... here, here! ""Primitive people used to believe that the moon was a cause of insanity. Sometimes they would pray to the moon to send a special meteor to fix the problem the moon had caused. These meteors were expected to *quell*"" (slams the book down on the table) the madmen."
TARA,The man in the woods. He was a mental patient.
XANDER,And he got pretty well ... quelled.
WILLOW,"Okay, I'm looking in history right now. It says in the Middle Ages there were these sweeping plagues of madness. People were losing their marbles everywhere. But then it would suddenly subside. And these dates look pretty close. Like-like maybe it happened after each one of the meteor events."
GILES,So something emerged from the meteors ... and quelled the madmen.
XANDER,"Meteor go boom, crazy guy goes bye-bye."
TARA,Xander's little book made it sound like this Queller thing had to be summoned. So ... who summoned it?
XANDER,"Who else? My money's on Glory, our resident beastie summoner."
WILLOW,We should call Buffy. E-except we can't call Buffy. (looks up at Giles) Can we?
GILES,"No, but we better call Riley."
RILEY,Queller demon?
WILLOW,"(on phone) Yeah, that's our perp. (Cut to Willow on a pay phone in the library) It's sort of a scavenger that can be summoned to kill-"
RILEY,(on phone) Crazy people.
WILLOW,"Yeah, how'd you know?"
RILEY,'Cause I've got five corpses here at the mental ward at Sunnydale Memorial.
WILLOW,"(on phone) You're at the hospital? Oh, listen, Riley, I ... I saw Buffy's mom earlier, and she was acting kinda ... wacky. Insane wacky, if you know what I mean?"
RILEY,"It's okay. Joyce was released earlier today. That intern, um, Ben, told me. They're safe at home."
WILLOW,"Oh, good. A-and the thing, the Queller, is it still there?"
RILEY,We - I think I've got it cornered in the air ducts.
RILEY,"Look, Willow, keep at what you're doing. Call me if you find out how I can kill this thing."
WILLOW,"Well, okay, but shouldn't we come help- (She hears a dial tone as Riley has hung up) Oooookay. (Hangs up and walks away)"
JOYCE,I wish that someone had bothered to tell me that there would be tennis being played!
JOYCE,"I just didn't know. Those eyes ... (grimly) Those eyes, they're like gasoline puddles! (quieter) Tell me. Tell me because I need to know why, why are you staring at me like that?"
JOYCE,"(OS) What are you asking me? You are asking me, aren't you? Is this a test? And if this counts for the final grade, I need to know now! (Dawn makes faces, not wanting to hear this) Okay, there are teachers, and they put this on the syllabus, but they do not stare down at you, they do not cling, (teary) they do not look down on you...."
JOYCE,"(crying) You know there are people who are nice, and they give you presents, even when you are bad."
JOYCE,"Does someone know you're here? Because they should have told you that at the gate. You are *not* supposed to be here. I need to rest now. I-I don't like the way you're staring at me! (She pauses for a moment, staring wide-eyed) Did they tell you that at the gate?"
JOYCE,"(firmly) Stop staring at me, I don't like it!"
GRAHAM,"Trail stops here, edge of the parking lot."
ELLIS,It stops? (Graham nods)
RILEY,A car. It hitched a ride. Probably underneath. So much for containment.
ELLIS,"So some poor mental patient checks out of here today, drives away with this thing, (Riley looks alarmed) took it right to his own home."
RILEY,Checked out today.
ELLIS,(to another commando) Get me a list of all patients discharged in the last 24 hours.
RILEY,"No. I know where it's going. We've gotta move, now!"
<blockquote>[Transcriber's Note,"As near as I can tell there are three doors to Joyce's bedroom. One leads to the hallway; the one next to that leads to Dawn's room; and the door on the other side of the bed leads to Buffy's room. The bathroom is across the hall from Dawn's room and has two doors, one going to the hall, the other going into Buffy's room. This is relevant for the following scene...]</blockquote>"
JOYCE,"I'm going to close my eyes, and when I open them, you are going to go away."
JOYCE,Get off me!
DAWN,Buffy!!
DAWN,BUFFY!
BUFFY,What? What is it?
DAWN,"There's something out there, Buffy. It's after Mom!"
BUFFY,You guys stay in here. Don't leave this room.
JOYCE,"It's okay, my baby. It's okay."
BUFFY,Spike?
SPIKE,"Yeah. Listen, uh, did you hear a noise?"
BUFFY,What the hell are you doing in my house?
SPIKE,"Right then, caught me. (takes a deep breath) Your basement's full of junk. And me being in need of, uh,  junk..."
BUFFY,(can't believe it) You were stealing?
SPIKE,"Well, yeah. Can't exactly work the counter at Burger Barn, can I?"
BUFFY,"Wait, are those pictures of me?"
SPIKE,Buffy!
RILEY,(to Buffy) Are you okay?
SPIKE,(to Riley) You just missed a real nice time.
BUFFY,It's gone. I killed it.
JOYCE,(relieved) Oh god.
DAWN,It's gone? You promise?
BUFFY,"I promise. (Both Dawn and Joyce hug her, putting their heads on her shoulders. She puts her arms around them) Everything's all right. Everything's all right."
Cut to,"exterior hospital, night. Ben comes down some stairs, walks over to a car, unlocks it and gets in, looking around nervously. As he closes the door, a voice speaks up from the back seat."
DREG,"It's strange. (Ben looks up, startled, and looks at him in the rear-view mirror) A body might ask what exactly it is you think you're doing. He might ask what all this was meant to accomplish. Because to a humble postulant, it looks like chaos. Like unnecessary attention drawn where it ought not to be."
BEN,(angrily) Get out!
DREG,Sir.
DREG,"Sir, forgive me. I just want to understand. Why summon the Queller?"
BEN,What do you think? Because I'm cleaning up Glory's mess. Just like I've done my whole damn life.
JOYCE,"Buffy, uh, (clears throat) I'm gonna ask you something, a-and if I'm, if I'm being crazy you just tell me, okay?"
BUFFY,(nods) You got it.
JOYCE,"The other day ... well, actually, I'm, I'm not sure when, the days seem to all bleed together..."
BUFFY,It's not important.
JOYCE,"No, I guess it isn't. I do know I was ... pretty out of it, and I had ... not-not a dream ... exactly, more like I had this ... knowledge, i-it just came to me like ....truth, you know? (Buffy frowns) Even though it didn't seem...possible, even though I shouldn't even think such things."
BUFFY,What?
JOYCE,That Dawn...
JOYCE,"She's not ... mine, is she?"
BUFFY,No.
JOYCE,"She's ... she does belong to us, though."
BUFFY,"Yes, she does."
JOYCE,And she's important. To the world. Precious. (Buffy nods) As precious as you are to me.
JOYCE,"Then we have to take care of her. Buffy, promise me. If anything happens, if I don't come through this-"
BUFFY,Mom-
JOYCE,"No, listen to me. No matter what she is, she still feels like my daughter. I have to know that you'll take care of her, that you'll keep her safe. That you'll love her like I love you."
BUFFY,(teary) I promise.
JOYCE,Good. Good.
JOYCE,"Oh, my sweet brave Buffy. What would I do without you?"
Executive Producer,Joss Whedon.
