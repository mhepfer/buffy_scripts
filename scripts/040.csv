Giles,"'And on that tragic day, an era came to its inevitable end.'  That's all there is. Are you ready?"
Buffy,Hit me.
Giles,"Which of the following best expresses the theme of the passage?  A) Violence breeds violence, B) All things must end, C)..."
Buffy,'B'. I'm going with 'B'. We haven't had 'B' in forever.
Giles,"(exasperated) This is the SATs, Buffy, not connect-the-dots.  Please pay attention. A low score could seriously harm your chances of  getting into college."
Buffy,"Gee, thanks. That takes the pressure right off."
Giles,"This isn't meant to be easy, you know. It's a rite of passage."
Buffy,"Well, is it too late to join a tribe where they just pierce  something or cut something off?"
Giles,"Buffy, please concentrate. (looks back at his book)"
Buffy,Roll!
Giles,(looks up) What?
Buffy,Hmm. I broke my No. 2 pencil. We'll have to do this again  sometime.
Giles,C) All systems tend towards chaos.
Buffy,I just know that us and the undead are the only people in  Sunnydale working this late.
Trick,I'm a very delicate person.
Trick,"(inhales) It's a little out of my element, but I can get you  what you need. I know a beast who knows a guy."
Trick,"Well, this guy's worked your town before, and if he lives up to  his rep, (smiles) this place'll be in flames."
Buffy,"And then I was being chased by an improperly filled-in answer  bubble screaming, 'none of the above!'"
Willow,Wow. I hope that wasn't one of your prophecy dreams. (gets a  look from Buffy) Probably not.
Oz,"Hey, you know, I took it last year. I could help you get ready.  There's this whole trick to antonyms, but... this isn't the place."
Willow,Oz is the highest-scoring person ever to fail to graduate.
Buffy,Isn't she cute when she's proud?
Oz,She's always cute.
Willow,We could work on it tonight.
Xander,Work on what tonight?
Cordelia,"Oh, God. Are we killing something again?"
Buffy,Only my carefree spirit.
Oz,Buffy SAT prep.
Willow,Oz is helping. (smiling proudly) He's the highest-scoring...
Cordelia,(interrupts) We know. We did the impressed thing already.
Xander,"I hate they make us take that thing. It's totally fascist, and  personally, I think it, uh, discriminates against the uninformed."
Cordelia,"Actually, I'm looking forward to it. I do well on  standardized tests."
Cordelia,What? I can't have layers?
Willow,"So, Buff, study tonight?"
Buffy,"Uh, yes on the studying, no on tonight. I'm putting in Mom time.  She's been drastic ever since I got back. And Giles is even worse. I'm  supervised 24-7."
Buffy,"It's like being in the Real World house, only real."
Willow,Hmm.
Willow,"Ooh, candy bars! Lots of 'em!"
Xander,"Principal Snyder, thank you! (takes the box) You weren't  visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past, by any chance?"
Snyder,It's band candy.
Buffy,"Let's hear it for the band, huh? Very generous."
Snyder,You will sell it to raise money for the marching band. They  need new uniforms.
Xander,"Yeah. Those tall, fuzzy hats ain't cheap, huh?"
Oz,But they go with everything.
Buffy,"I'm sure we love the idea of going all Willy Loman, but we're  not in the band."
Snyder,"And if I'd handed you a trombone, that would've been a problem,  Summers. (holds out a box) It's candy. (she takes it) Sell it."
Joyce,But you're not in the band.
Buffy,And yet.
Joyce,"Buffy, what would I do with forty chocolate bars?"
Buffy,"You could hand them out at the Gallery. 'Buy something Pre- Columbian, get a free cavity.'"
Joyce,Twenty.
Buffy,You're a good mom. (sets down the box)
Joyce,I'm the best.
Buffy,"(picks up her glass) No, I'm pretty sure the best moms let their  daughters drive."
Joyce,And yet.
Buffy,"(sets down her glass) Oh, come on!"
Joyce,"(gets up) Look, let's not have this conversation. (goes to the  fridge)"
Buffy,But I took the class. I watched the filmstrips with the blood  and the death and the corpses. I'm prepped.
Joyce,"(opens the fridge) Honey, (grabs the water jug) you failed the  written test. (pours herself more) They wouldn't even let you *take* the  road test. (puts the water back)"
Buffy,"That was a year ago. And I don't test well... she said, two days  before the SATs."
Joyce,(comes back to her seat) I spend enough time not knowing where  you are. (sits) I don't wanna add to that the possibility that you're on  the highway to Chicago. (takes a drink)
Buffy,"(dumbfounded) I can't believe you. I'm *not* taking off again.  (shrugs) Besides, if I wanted to, I could just get on a bus."
Joyce,"Stop. (inhales) Don't. (exhales and looks at Buffy intensely) I  just don't want you driving, okay? I want you here."
Buffy,(widens her eyes) I'm here. Hmm? (picks up her egg roll) See me  here. (takes a bite) Mm-hm?
Buffy,(with her mouth full) Mm... I gotta go. (gets up and grabs her  box of candy bars)
Joyce,"What, you're going out?"
Buffy,(turns back at the door) Giles. Slay-study double feature. Could  be late.
Joyce,"Again? Honey, don't you think Mr. Giles is monopolizing an awful  lot of your time?"
Buffy,And does he ever say he's sorry?
Buffy,Ow!
Giles,Sorry.
Buffy,Why do I put up with this?
Giles,Because it is your destiny... (walks around her) and because I  just bought twenty 'cocorific' candy bars. (hands her a large rubber  ball)
Buffy,"Okay, you're just doing this to take funny pictures of me."
Giles,"(walks around her) I'm doing it to test your awareness of an  opponent's location during a fight in total darkness. Now, wait five  seconds and then throw the ball at me."
Buffy,"You ran out of new training ideas about a week ago, huh? Okay.  Five, four, three, two, one."
Giles,"It's not that simple, is it..."
Giles,"Ow. Ahem. Yes, well, very good."
Buffy,(takes off the blindfold) Thanks! (heads out of the library)
Giles,W-w-w-where are you going? We have to patrol!
Buffy,(stops and faces him) I can't. Mom's in hyperdrive. She wants me  home tonight. I told you. (starts out again)
Giles,"But, I..."
Buffy,"(stops by the door) I know, I know. She's out of control. Enjoy  the candy! (leaves)"
Angel,Buffy.
Buffy,I didn't know you could do that.
Angel,I-I'm feeling better.
Buffy,Angel...
Buffy,Let's... get you inside.
Angel,It's late. How'd you get away?
Buffy,"Aw, it was easy. Started a fire in the prison laundry room. Rode  out in the garbage truck."
Angel,Oh.
Buffy,I'm joking. (raises her right hand and waves it) No garbage.  Smell me.
Angel,"How is, uh... Scott?"
Buffy,"Scott? (smiles weakly and looks down) Oh, um... boyfriend Scott.  Uh... (inhales deeply) A-actually, he's not... (looks up at him) He's  fine. (exhales and nods)"
Buffy,"Uh, that's for you."
Buffy,Uh... I-it's fresh from the butcher.
Angel,Thanks.
Angel,"You're being careful, right?"
Buffy,(looks up surprised) With Scott?
Angel,The slaying.
Buffy,Oh. (smiles and exhales) Uh... Yeah. Of course. (nodding a lot)  Full of carefulness.
Angel,(looks down) I worry about you. (looks at her)
Buffy,(pauses briefly) I worry about *you*.
Angel,I'm getting stronger.
Buffy,"(gives him a little smile) Yeah, pretty soon, you won't even  need me."
Angel,(nods a little) That'll be better.
Buffy,(unsure how to take that) Yeah.
Buffy,"Hey! (thinks fast) Uh, sorry I'm late. You know Giles. All slay,  all the time."
Giles,"Hello, Buffy."
Buffy,(gestures into the living room) Do you guys wanna watch some  television? I hear there's a very insightful Nightline on.
Joyce,"Buffy, you lied to us. And you made us into your alibis.  That's... playing us against each other, and that's not fair."
Giles,I called Willow. (Buffy is at a loss) You also lied to her about  your whereabouts. We were all concerned.
Giles,"Oh, thank you. (breaks off a piece)"
Buffy,"Look, I'm sorry, but I had to..."
Joyce,Were you at the Bronze? What was happening there that was so  important?
Buffy,(gestures and shrugs) Bronze things. Things of Bronze.
Joyce,"(condescendingly) You're acting really immature, Buffy."
Giles,"(also chewing) I know I'm not your parent, but I am responsible  for you. I think your mum's right. (sits on a couch armrest)"
Buffy,"Okay, fine. I'm acting like a child. Maybe that's because you're  both treating me like a child."
Joyce,(sounding hurt) Buffy!
Buffy,"You're both scheduling me twenty-four hours a day. Between the  two of you, that's forty-eight hours. (Giles takes off his glasses) I  just wanna be able to make a few decisions on my own."
Joyce,"The last time you made a decision on your own, you split. (pops  another piece of candy)"
Buffy,"Yeah, and I took care of myself. I don't need this much active  parenting."
Joyce,(incredulous) You can't really be trying to use this summer as a  reason you should be trusted. (eats another piece)
Buffy,You can't babysit me all the time. I need you to back off a  little.
Giles,"(holds up his hand) Uh, alright, come on. Let's, let's not, uh,  freak out."
Buffy,(taken aback) 'Freak out'?
Giles,"Mm-hm. (stands up) Uh, I think you should go to bed. (puts his  glasses back on) Um, we're all tired."
Joyce,"Oh, she just drives me crazy!"
Joyce,I just want to protect her.
Giles,Don't all parents want that?
Joyce,"Yeah, but at least most parents have some idea what to protect  their children from."
Giles,Yeah. And I think we should both be especially careful.
Joyce,Mm.
Ethan,Trust me. (steps around the worker to face him) You don't want  to eat that.
Boy,Think fast.
Cordelia,"(sighs) I heard that there was a secret rule that if a  teacher's more than ten minutes late, we can all leave."
Buffy,(looks up from studying) It's Giles' turn to watch study hall.  He'll be here. (looks back at her book) He's allergic to late.
Cordelia,"(sighs) He is wound a little tight. I had this philosophy  book checked out from the library for, like, a year, and he made me pay  the fine, even though it was huge. (Buffy gives her a look) I was sad to  return it. (smiles) It was perfect for starting conversations with  college boys. (lets out a little laugh) Of course, that was B.X."
Buffy,B.X.? (gets a nod from Cordelia) Before Xander. Clever.
Xander,I like chocolate. (Willow looks at him) There is no bad here.
Willow,"You still have some left? (shrugs) I went to, like, four  houses, and they were gone. It's like Trick-or-Treating in reverse.  (smiles at him)"
Xander,"I know. These things are selling like hot cakes... (they look  at each other) which is ironic, 'cause the hot cakes really aren't  moving..."
Xander,"And it's, uh, ahem, fun to sell chocolate. Ahem."
Willow,And we're raising a lot of money for the band.
Xander,The band. Yeah. They're great. They march.
Willow,"Like an army. (cut above) (very distracted) E-e-except with  music instead of bullets, and... usually no one dies."
Cordelia,I can't believe this.
Cordelia,"Where is Giles already? I'm bored, and he's not here to give  me credit for it."
Snyder,"The big pinhead librarian didn't show up, and I don't wanna do  it. (points at her with his candy bar) You do it."
Snyder,(to himself) Everybody expects me to do everything around here  because I'm the principal. (starts to walk) It's not fair.
Xander,Does anyone else wanna marry Ms. Barton?
Cordelia,Get in line.
Willow,I guess Giles isn't coming?
Buffy,(very concerned) I guess not.
Giles,Buffy.
Buffy,"(walks in) Uh... sorry. I... I was just worried. You were a big  not-there in study hall, and after your lecture to me on not ducking  out... (confused) and what is my mother doing here?"
Giles,"(with a mouth full of chocolate) We had an opportunity for, um,  you might say, a summit meeting. It took priority over study hall. I  called in."
Buffy,(still confused) Oh.
Joyce,"We decided that you made a good point earlier, honey."
Buffy,I did. Yeah. (very confused now) Which was...?
Joyce,A-about us overscheduling you. (looks to Giles for support)
Giles,"Pulling you in two directions, (sits on the coffee table) uh,  your home life and your duties as a Slayer."
Buffy,Oh. That was a good point.
Joyce,We're working out a coordinated schedule for you.
Giles,"It'll be tight, but, uh, I think we can fit in all your  responsibilities. (smiles)"
Buffy,(gives them an uncertain smile) Sounds nice and structured.
Joyce,"We've got more work to do here, honey. Why don't you give us a  little more time?"
Joyce,"Um... Take the car, and, um, Mr. Giles can drive me home. (holds  out the keys)"
Buffy,"(wide-eyed) What? (smiles and shakes her head) Excuse me, I  meant what?!"
Joyce,Keys. Take them.
Buffy,"You don't have to tell *me* twice. Well, actually, you did,  but... (snatches the keys) bye! (rushes out)"
Joyce,"Bye, honey. Drive careful."
Buffy,(opens the door) Uh-huh!
Joyce,Do you think she noticed anything?
Giles,No way!
Willow,Tell me again how it happened.
Buffy,"Told my mom I wanted to be treated more like a grownup, and  voila: (smiles) driviness."
Buffy,"Also, I think she wanted me otherwhere. Considering my mom and  Giles are planning my future, I think it's easier for them to live my  life if I'm not actually there."
Willow,(notices the parking brake) Do you know that you have the  parking brake on?
Buffy,Uh-huh.
Willow,"(nervously) Are, are you sure about the Bronze? I mean, the  SATs are tomorrow."
Buffy,"I can study at the Bronze. (smiles) A little dancing, a little  cross-multiplying. (smiles wickedly) You know what we need?"
Willow,Eyes on the road! Eyes on the road!
Joyce,You got good albums.
Giles,"Yeah, they're okay. (lights the cigarettes)"
Lyrics,<I>And the colors of the sea bind your eyes with trembling  mermaids</I>
Joyce,Do you like Seals and Croft?
Lyrics,<I>And you touch the distant beaches with tales of brave Ulysses</I>
Joyce,"Yeah, me neither."
Lyrics,<I>How his naked ears were tortured by the sirens sweetly singing</I>
Joyce,Thanks. (takes a drag)
Lyrics,<I>For the sparkling waves are calling you</I>
Joyce,"So how come they, uh, call you Ripper?"
Lyrics,<I>To kiss their white-laced lips</I>
Giles,(sits up) Wouldn't you like to know.
Giles,"Hmm, wait a minute. Listen to this bit."
Giles,It rocks!
Lyrics,<I>And you see a girl's brown body</I>
Joyce,It's good.
Giles,"Man, I gotta get a band together."
Lyrics,<I>Dancing through the turquoise</I>
Joyce,"(stands up) Hey, Ripper, you wanna watch TV?"
Lyrics,<I>And her footprints make you follow where the sky loves the sea</I>
Joyce,(leans against the cabinet) I know how to order pay-per-view.
Giles,"(takes off his outer shirt) No, let's go out and have some fun."
Lyrics,"<I>And when your fingers find her, she drowns you in her body</I>"
Giles,Tear things up a bit.
Joyce,Okay. We could go to the Bronze.
Lyrics,<I>Carving deep blue ripples in the tissues of your mind</I>
Giles,Not bloody likely. That place is dead.
Devon,"Hey, they're diggin' us, man!"
Lyrics,<I>The strangest things / I've always known</I>
Lyrics,<I>It slays me every time</I>
Lyrics,<I>Darkened fields / Have overgrown</I>
Buffy,Let's do the time warp again.
Lyrics,<I>You want to lay me out?</I>
Willow,"Maybe there's a reunion in town or, or a Billy Joel tour or  something."
Lyrics,<I>Tie me down? / Tie me</I>
Buffy,Ms. Barton?
Lyrics,<I>Our love</I>
Willow,"Are you okay, Ms. Barton?"
Lyrics,<I>Covered in my blood</I>
Lyrics,<I>Is so violent</I>
Lyrics,<I>Our love</I>
Buffy,"A-are you sure you don't need some fresh air, Ms. Barton?"
Lyrics,<I>Covered in my blood</I>
Willow,"Hey, this is not normal."
Lyrics,<I>Is so violent</I>
Willow,"Uh, w-well, maybe that goes without saying."
Snyder,"(smiling hugely) Hey, gang! (puts his arms around the girls'  shoulders) This place is Fun City, huh? (laughs)"
Buffy,Principal Snyder?
Lyrics,<I>Shake this scene / another one</I>
Snyder,"Call me Snyder. Just a last name, like... (trying to be cool)  Barbarino."
Snyder,Ooh! I'm so stoked!
Lyrics,<I>It plays me every time</I>
Snyder,"Hey, did you see Ms. Barton? I think she's wasted."
Lyrics,<I>We're not that green</I>
Snyder,I'm gonna have to put that in her next performance review  'cause... (smiles) 'cause I'm the principal! (laughs)
Lyrics,<I>We're overdone</I>
Lyrics,<I>You want to lay me out?</I>
Willow,(to Buffy) I don't like this. They could have heart attacks.
Lyrics,<I>Tie me down?</I>
Buffy,"Uh, well... ma-maybe there's a doctor here."
Man,(yelling) Yeeeeaaaaaah!
Willow,I think that *is* my doctor.
Willow,He-he's usually less... topless.
Snyder,I got a commendation for being principal. (impressed with  himself) From the Mayor! (gestures) Shook my hand twice.
Buffy,That's nice.
Snyder,Whoa! There are some foxy ladies here tonight!
Willow,What's happening?
Buffy,"I don't know, but it's happening to a whole lot of grownups."
Willow,They're acting like a bunch...
Buffy,They're acting like a bunch of us.
Lyrics,<I>Our love</I>
Willow,(confused) I don't act like this.
Lyrics,<I>Covered in my blood</I>
Trick,Demand's high.
Ethan,I thought it might be.
Trick,"That's the reason I love this country. You make a good product,  and the people will come to you. Of course, a lot of them are gonna die,  but that's the other reason I love this country."
Trick,Hey! Don't sample the product.
Man,But I didn't.
Ethan,"Okay. Uh, how did you know he was..."
Trick,I don't. Now I know no one else will. (checks his watch) We're  getting close. (to a line worker) Keep it flowing. (to Ethan) It's  almost feeding time.
Buffy,Something's definitely changing them.
Willow,A spell?
Oz,"They're teenagers. It's a sobering mirror to look into, huh?"
Snyder,You've got great hair.
Willow,It just gets more upsetting.
Buffy,No vampire has ever been (points at the stage) *that* scary.
Patron,Fight!
Snyder,Fight!
Buffy,We've gotta figure out what's going on. This has Hellmouth  fingerprints all over it.
Snyder,"Hey, where are we going?"
Snyder,"Wait up, you guys!"
Snyder,"Hey! You guys aren't trying to ditch me, are ya?"
Oz,"We should find Giles. He'll know what's going on, right?"
Buffy,"Sure. Except for all we know, he's sweet sixteen again. (pulls  on her seat belt)"
Willow,He's with your mom at his place.
Snyder,"I said, wait up! (slams the door)"
Oz,"Uh, Snyder..."
Buffy,No time. He's coming with us.
Snyder,"Whoa, Summers! You drive like a spaz!"
Willow,It'll be okay when we get to Giles'.
Oz,"Of course, I mean, even if he's sixteen, he's still Giles, right?  He's probably a pretty together guy."
Willow,"(worried) Yeah, well..."
Oz,What?
Buffy,"Giles at sixteen? Less Together Guy, more Bad-Magic-Hates-The- World-Ticking-Time-Bomb Guy."
Oz,"Well, then I guess your mom's in a lotta trouble."
Joyce,Must be exciting being from England. (chews her gum)
Giles,Not particularly. (kicks a can) You cold? (takes a puff of his  cigarette)
Joyce,"Nah-uh. I feel... special, like I'm just waking up, kinda."
Giles,"Oh, yeah?"
Joyce,"Yeah, like, uh, getting married and having a kid and everything  was just a dream, and now things are back like they're supposed to be."
Giles,Yeah?
Joyce,"That's cool! (nods, smiles, chews) Very Juice Newton."
Giles,(checks his hair in the reflection) You fancy it?
Joyce,"Yeah, but the store's closed."
Giles,Woo-hoo!
Joyce,"Oh, Ripper! Wow, that was sooo brave!"
Officer,Hold it!
Snyder,"This is great! Let's do doughnuts in the football field, huh?"
Willow,"Oh, my God, look out!"
Giles,Ooo... Copper's got a gun!
Giles,"You'll never use it, though, man."
Officer,Will so.
Joyce,"Ripper, be careful!"
Giles,Told him he'd never use it. (smiles)
Joyce,You are sooo cool. (laughs) You're like Burt Reynolds.
Man,Sorry! Gotta go!
Buffy,"Oh, God."
Buffy,Are you guys okay?
Willow,Is anybody else all creeped out and trembly?
Snyder,"Oh, Buffy... (rubs his shoulder) Your mom's gonna kill you."
Buffy,Something's weird.
Oz,Something's not?
Buffy,No grownups.
Buffy,No one's protecting their houses. Everyone's just... wandering.
Snyder,Hey!
Snyder,"Hey, give it! (goes after the man)"
Willow,Defenseless.
Buffy,So where are all the vampires?
Buffy,"Soup's on, but no one's grabbing a spoon."
Oz,Something's happening... someplace that's else.
Buffy,I'd say something big.
Snyder,(returns upset) That guy took my candy!
Buffy,The candy. I-it's gotta be the candy! It's cursed.
Snyder,"(worried) A curse?! Oh, I've got a curse."
Willow,"God, using candy for evil!"
Oz,My parents ate a ton.
Buffy,Who's behind it?
Snyder,(confused) I don't know. It came through the school board.  (shakes his head) If you knew that crowd...
Buffy,(losing her patience) Where did it come from? Do you know where  to get it?
Snyder,Yeah.
Buffy,(to Willow and Oz) You guys get Xander and Cordelia. Go to the  library and look it up.
Oz,Candy curses?
Willow,Disturbing second childhood. Got it.
Buffy,(to Snyder) Ratboy and I are going to the source.
Buffy,Mom? Giles?!
Giles,(not skipping a beat) Go away. We're busy.
Buffy,Mom!
Joyce,Hey!
Buffy,(shocked) Where did you get that coat?  Never mind. Listen...
Giles,Back off!
Buffy,"Giles, think about this. You wanna fight me, or you wanna let me  talk to my mother?"
Buffy,"Mom, look at me. Do you know who I am?"
Joyce,"(smiles) Of course. You're Buffy. (looks over at the crowd) Hey,  look. They're, they're giving away candy. You want some candy?"
Buffy,"No, I don't! And you don't need any more, either."
Joyce,(very annoyed) I'm fine. I can have more if I want.
Buffy,You are *not* fine. You need to go home.
Joyce,(angry now) Screw you. I want candy!
Buffy,Mom!
Joyce,"You wanna slay stuff, and *I'm* not allowed to do anything about  it. Well, this is what *I* wanna do, so get off my back!"
Buffy,"Mom, please, this is..."
Giles,"(reaches for Joyce) Oh, for God's sake. (pulls her away) Just  let your mum have the sodding candy. C'mon, Joyce..."
Buffy,"Mom, look at your car. Look at that dent the size of New  Brunswick. I did that."
Joyce,"Oh, my God. (grossed out) What was I thinking when I bought the  *Geek* Machine?"
Buffy,Listen to me. You need...
Giles,"(interrupts) No, you listen to me. (points at her) I'm your  Watcher, so you do what I tell you. (points at the Jeep) Now, sod off!"
Buffy,(sternly) Take her home.
Giles,Joyce...
Buffy,Mom!
Joyce,Hey!
Giles,(looks up) Oy! You leave her alone!
Snyder,"Hey, Brit-face! Wait up!"
Buffy,Stay.
Snyder,It smells so chocolatey.
Giles,This is far out.
Ethan,"Yeah, I've been out there. Town's wide open. You guys can go  anytime."
Buffy,Ethan Rayne.
Ethan,"(into the phone, nervously) Might wanna hurry."
Giles,Ethan.
Ethan,Ripper.
Cordelia,"At first it was fun, you know? They seemed like they were in  this really good mood--not like parents--and then..."
Willow,Badness?
Cordelia,"Mom started borrowing my clothes. There should be an age  limit on lycra pants. And Dad, he just locked himself in the bathroom  with old copies of Esquire."
Xander,"I don't get this. The candy's supposed to make you feel all  immature and stuff, but I've had a ton, and I don't feel any dif..."
Xander,Never mind.
Willow,I'll take that one.
Cordelia,You wanna swap?
Willow,(startled) What? (confused) Swap?
Cordelia,"You wanna swap? This book is really thick, (trades with  Willow) and I'm not sure it's in English."
Giles,Where... Bloody Hell!
Buffy,That's what smoking will do to you. Now be quiet.
Giles,Well... Where'd the bastard go?
Buffy,(annoyed) Shh!
Giles,What?
Buffy,Look. A box full of farm-fresh chicken.
Joyce,Do you suppose they're okay?
Snyder,"(chewing) Mm-hm. (keeps chewing) So... (chews) are you two  kinda... (smacks his lips) like, um... (looks at her knees) goin'  steady?"
Buffy,"So, Ethan, what are we playing? We're pretty much in a talk-or- bleed situation. Your call."
Giles,Hit him.
Ethan,I-I'd just like to point out that this wasn't my idea.
Buffy,Meaning...?
Ethan,I'm subcontracting. It's Trick you want. I'm just helping him  collect a tribute... for a demon.
Giles,He's lying. Hit him!
Buffy,"I don't think he is, and shut up."
Giles,"(excitedly) You're *my* Slayer, (points at Ethan) go knock his  teeth down his thr..."
Buffy,(interrupts) Giles!
Buffy,(to Ethan) What demon?
Ethan,I don't remember.
Giles,(smiles) Yes!
Ethan,Lurconis. Demon named Lurconis. They wanted a way to get the  tribute away from people.
Buffy,So you're just Diversion Guy?
Ethan,"More than a diversion. Well, they said the tribute was big, so  big that people would never let them take it. That people had to be out- of-it. And later on, when the candy wore off, they'd blame themselves."
Buffy,"(sighs) Hence, land of the irresponsible. So, where's Trick?"
Ethan,I don't know exactly.
Giles,Hit him again.
Ethan,(wards her off with his hand) No! I-I-I really don't know.  Delivering the tribute.
Buffy,"(steps closer) Which brings us to the bonus question, and  believe me when I say a wrong answer will cost you *all* your points."
Buffy,What's the tribute?
Buffy,Right. Lurconis.
Willow,(cut to her) Lurconis. A demon. What's his deal?
Buffy,See if it says anything about a tribute.
Willow,A tribute? Like what?
Buffy,(cut to her) I don't know. (looks at Ethan) My source is all  tapped out.
Snyder,"(to Ethan) She whupped you good, huh? (throws two punches) Yah!  Wah! (stands up proudly) I can do that. I took Tae Kwon Do at the Y."
Buffy,"(into the phone) No, no. It's definitely a demon. A big one."
Giles,I wouldn't.
Buffy,"Giles, give me the gun. (holds out her hand)"
Buffy,(stares back) Giles...
Buffy,(sternly insistent) Now.
Joyce,"Uh, it's, um, it's Willow. She wants you real bad."
Buffy,(takes the phone) Uh-huh?
Willow,"(into the phone) Okay, Oz just found it. (reads) 'The tribute  to Lurconis is made every thirty years.' (paraphrases) I-it's a ritual  feeding. A-and this one's late, so it's probably, you know, a big meal."
Willow,Oh. (reads to herself) And... (digests the information and  recoils) Oh. Lurconis eats babies.
Buffy,Come on. (takes her mother's hand)
Joyce,"Well, what about that man?"
Buffy,"Uh, see if you guys can find something to tie him up with."
Joyce,Um...
Buffy,*Never* tell me.
Nurse,(in the background) I didn't see anything. I don't *know* where  they are.
Joyce,(sad and worried) Something's gonna eat those babies?
Nurse,(in the background) What can *I* do?
Snyder,I think that is so wrong. (shakes his head)
Nurse,(in the background) Get off my back about it! (stalks off  shaking her head)
Giles,She says she never saw who took them. Dozy cow.
Buffy,I *know* who took them.
Giles,"Well, then let's do something. Let's find the demon and, and...  kick the crap out of it."
Snyder,Is that what happens now?
Buffy,"Yeah, if we knew where they were. (paces)"
Giles,"'Lurconis dwells beneath the city, filth to filth.'"
Buffy,(stops pacing) What?
Giles,"Ooo! (faces her) I know this. (tries to remember more) Uh... I  knew this. 'Lurconis' means... (thinks) 'glutton'. And we'll find it,  um... (thinks, shrugs) in the sewers."
Joyce,The sewers? (goes to Giles for a hug)
Snyder,"Uh, good. You go do that thing with the demon, and I'll stay  here in case the babies, you know, uh... find their way back."
Joyce,(lets go of Giles) (sadly) The babies must be so scared.
Giles,(to Snyder) You filthy little ponce. (steps toward him and  challenges) Are you afraid of a little demon?
Snyder,"If you want to splash around in the poo, (shoves Giles) you're  the filthy one!"
Buffy,"(gets between them, very annoyed) Okay, you know what? Everybody  just stop it! (to Snyder) Okay, listen to me. (to Giles) I need help,  okay? Giles, I need grownups."
Buffy,"These children are gonna die if we don't act now, okay, and  think clearly. (gets Giles' attention) There is no room for mistakes.  Besides which... you guys are just wigging me out."
Giles,Sorry.
Joyce,We'll behave.
Buffy,"Good. (to Snyder) Snyder, go home."
Snyder,I can do that. (leaves)
Buffy,"(turns to face Giles) Giles, we're going to the sewers."
Buffy,And don't do that! (stalks out of the room)
Trick,"(to himself about Lurconis) Come on, big guy. They're not  getting any fresher."
Buffy,Hi.
Giles,What the hell's that?
Buffy,"Lurconis, I'm thinking."
Trick,"Ordinarily, I like other people to do my fighting for me, but I  just gotta see what you got."
Buffy,Just tell me when it hurts.
Buffy,Giles! No!
Trick,"You and me, girl. (Buffy spins to face him) There's hard times  ahead."
Buffy,(exhales) They never just leave. Always gotta say something.
Joyce,Can we go home now?
Buffy,"Yeah, we can go home. I've got the SATs tomorrow."
Joyce,"Oh, blow them off. I'll write you a note. (goes back to the  babies)"
Buffy,No. It's okay. (joins her mom)
Joyce,Poor babies. Come on...
Trick,Paid him. The man did his job. No reason to burn that bridge.
Trick,"Where's the downside? You just got yourself one less demon you  have to pay tribute to. The way I see it, I did you a favor."
Xander,"Hey, Snyder. Heard you had some fun Friday night. Have you come  down yet?"
Snyder,That's 'Principal Snyder'.
Xander,And that's a big 'yep'.
Snyder,You look like four young people with too much time on your  hands.
Oz,Not really.
Cordelia,"Busy like a bee, actually. (smiles) Bee-like!"
Snyder,"Good. It seems we had some vandalism Friday on school property,  and I was just looking for some... volunteers to help clean it up."
Willow,"'Kiss rocks'? Why would anyone want to kiss... (gets a look  from Snyder) Oh, wait. I get it."
Snyder,(nods and continues on) Let's get you some paint remover.
Buffy,It was just too much to deal with. It was like nothing made  sense anymore. The things that I thought I understood were gone. I just  felt... so alone.
Giles,Was that the math or the verbal?
Buffy,Mostly the math.
Giles,"Well, if you scored low, then you can take them again."
Buffy,More SATs? (sighs) Is there really a point? I could die before I  even apply to college.
Giles,"And then, you very possibly might not."
Buffy,"Well, let's just keep hope alive."
Giles,Hello. (smiles awkwardly)
Joyce,(shyly) Hi.
Giles,"(sees the dent) I say, your car seems to have had an adventure,  doesn't it?"
Joyce,"Uh, Buffy assures me that it happened battling evil, so I'm  letting her pay for it on the installment plan."
Buffy,"Uh, hey, the way things were going, (points at the dent) be glad  that's the worst that happened. At least I got to the two of you before  you actually *did* something."
Joyce,Right.
Giles,Indeed.
Joyce,Y-yes.
