character,dialogue
Custodian,Can I help you?
Philip,Rupert Giles! I need to see him!
Custodian,"Mr. Giles, uh, he's our librarian. Next building over, first  door on your left."
Custodian,(sarcastically) You're welcome. (dumps the trash)
Philip,"Oh, God!"
Philip,Diedre?
Diedre,Philip.
Philip,"Help! Help! Somebody, please!"
Philip,"(to himself) God, no! (loud) Help!"
Giles,(loudly over the music) Must we have this noise during your  calisthenics?
Buffy,It's not noise! It's music!
Giles,I know music. Music has notes. This is noise.
Buffy,I'm aerobicising! I must have a beat!
Giles,(under the music) Wonderful. You work on your muscle tone while  my brain dribbles out of my ears.
Philip,Help! Help! Please!
Philip,"Help me, somebody, please!"
Giles,Ahhh! Very good. And the rest is silence.
Buffy,"I'm on a beach, but not one of those American beaches, one of  those island beaches where the water's way too blue, and I'm laying on  my towel, and it's just before sunset, and Gavin Rossdale's massaging my  feet!"
Willow,"Oh, that's good! Uh, I'm in Florence, Italy, I've rented a  scooter that's parked outside, and I'm in a little restaurant eating  ziti, and there are no more tables left, so they have to seat this guy  with me, and it's John Cusack!"
Buffy,Ooo! Very impressive. You have such an eye for detail.
Willow,'Cause with the ziti!
Xander,(shows up) What are you two up to?
Buffy,Just having a quick game of 'Anywhere But Here'.
Xander,Ooohhh. Amy Yip at the waterslide park.
Willow,You never come up with anything new.
Xander,"I'm just not fickle like you two, okay? I'm constant in my  affections. Amy Yip at the waterslide park!"
Willow,(to Buffy) Do you think Giles ever played 'Anywhere But Here'  when he was in school?
Xander,Giles lived for school. He's actually still bitter that there  are only twelve grades.
Buffy,"He probably sat in math class thinking, 'There should be more  math. This could be mathier.'"
Willow,"C'mon, you don't think he ever got restless as a kid?"
Buffy,Are you kidding? His diapers were tweed.
Buffy,Giles!
Giles,(turns and sees them) Oh! There you are. (comes over)
Buffy,"Hey, morning. Say, is that tweed? (stares at his jacket)"
Giles,"(preoccupied) What? Oh, uh, yes. Um, now, uh, look, tonight is  very important, um... (heads inside)"
Buffy,"(follows) Now, that's a surprise."
Buffy,"So, what's on tap tonight that's so important? Uprising,  prophesied ritual, preordained deathfest?"
Xander,"Ah, the old standards!"
Giles,"Um, a medical transport is delivering the monthly supply of  blood to the hospital."
Buffy,Mm. Vampire Meals-On-Wheels. (stops at her locker)
Giles,"Hopefully not. Uh, we'll meet outside the hospital at 8:30  sharp. I'll bring the weaponry."
Buffy,I'll bring the party mix!
Giles,Just don't be late.
Buffy,Have I ever let you down?
Giles,"Do you want me to answer that, or shall I just glare?"
Jenny,"(finds them) Morning, England."
Giles,"Oh, hello, Ms., uh, uh, tuh, Jenny."
Willow,"(to Xander, smiling) Feel the passion!"
Xander,(smiles back) Mm-hm!
Jenny,Willow...
Willow,"(coughs) Coughing, not speaking. (coughs more)"
Jenny,(to Willow) We still on for tomorrow?
Xander,What's tomorrow?
Jenny,I'm reviewing some computer basics for the couple of students  who've fallen behind. Willow's helping out for extra credit.
Xander,(chuckles) Those poor schlubs have to attend school on  Saturday! (smiles)
Jenny,"9am okay with you, Xander?"
Buffy,Got a bit of schlub on your shoe there.
Xander,"Heh, heh."
Jenny,"Well, Cordelia's gonna meet us."
Xander,"(dripping with sarcasm) Ooo, gang, did ya hear that? A bonus  day of class plus Cordelia! Mix in a little rectal surgery, and it's my  best day ever!"
Jenny,(to Giles) Walk me to class?
Giles,(a smile on his face) Pleasure.
Buffy,Look at them.
Xander,A twosome of cuteness.
Willow,Can't you just imagine them getting together?
Jenny,Oh! Thank you so much for loaning me the Forrester book. It's  wonderful!
Giles,"Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it!"
Jenny,"Yeah, it was so romantic, so evocative."
Giles,"That edition was my father's. I, I, I must've read it... twenty  times."
Jenny,"Yeah, y'know how you have to, to dog-ear your favorite pages so  you can go back to them?"
Giles,"Uh, uh, uh, what?"
Jenny,"Well, I mean, I-I practically had to fold back every single  page. So finally I just, I just started underlining all the pages I  really wanted to discuss."
Giles,U-u-underlined...?
Jenny,"But then, of course, I spilled coffee all over it, I can't even  read it..."
Giles,(can't believe it) It's a first edition!
Jenny,"I'm lying, Rupert. (smiles) The book's fine. (holds it up) I  just love to see you squirm. (hands him the book)"
Giles,"(smiles in relief) Yes, well, I, uh... trust I gave good...  squirm."
Jenny,Did anyone ever tell you you're kind of a fuddy-duddy?
Giles,Nobody ever seems to tell me anything else.
Jenny,Did anyone ever tell you you're kind of a sexy fuddy-duddy?
Giles,"Well, no. Actually that, that part usually gets left out.  (smiles) I c-can't imagine why."
Jenny,This weekend.
Giles,Would you like to go out?
Jenny,"Mm, no, I think I'd like to stay in."
Giles,"Uh, this, (clears his throat) Saturday, then."
Jenny,Saturday night. (clears her throat) I'll see if I can make you  squirm.
Giles,Yes?
Giles,Why?
Giles,(sets down his briefcase) My name?
Cordelia,"Well, evil just compounds evil, doesn't it? First I'm  sentenced to a computer tutorial on Saturday, now I have to read some  computer book... There are books on computers? Isn't the point of  computers to replace books?"
Giles,"(cuts her off) Cordelia, I'm a little busy right now. (points  out the detective)"
Cordelia,Oh! Great! (steps up to Det. Winslow) Can you help me with a  ticket? It's totally bogus. It was a one-way street. I was going one  way.
Giles,(raised voice) Cordelia!
Cordelia,What?! Why does everyone always yell my name? I'm not deaf!  And I can take a hint. (unsure) What's the hint?
Giles,To come back later.
Cordelia,"Yeah, when you've visited decaf land. (leaves)"
Giles,(to Det. Winslow) Where do you want me to go?
Attendant,Have you had your breakfast?
Giles,No.
Attendant,That was probably a good idea.
Giles,"(whispers) Yes. Yes. I-I mean, I did. His name's Philip Henry.  He was a friend of mine in London. I... I haven't spoken to him in  twenty years."
Giles,No.
Giles,"(lies) No. No, I don't."
Buffy,(exhales) 'Don't be late.' Sheesh.
Driver,"Hey, fellas."
Doctor,Hey.
Buffy,"All's well that ends with cute ER doctors, I always say."
Buffy,Since when do doctors take deliveries?
Doctor,See ya.
Driver,Hey! No sampling the product!
Buffy,Angel!
Angel,Buffy! Look out!
Buffy,How did you know about this?
Angel,It's delivery day. Everybody knows about this. They only ruined  one bag.
Buffy,Do you think you could make sure the hospital gets the rest?
Buffy,Thanks. I'm worried about Giles. He was supposed to meet me  here.
Angel,Maybe he's late.
Buffy,"Giles? Who counts tardiness as, like, the eighth deadly sin?"
Angel,Right. Go.
Giles,"Buffy. I-it's late. Uh, are you alright?"
Buffy,I was gonna ask you the same thing.
Giles,"Yes, I'm fine, fine. Look, I'm, uh, I'm rather busy a-at the  moment, so, uh, I'll see you on Monday at, at school."
Buffy,"Giles, did you forget? The hospital, vampires, handy carryout  packets of blood?"
Giles,"Oh! Yes, uh, are you alright? W-were you hurt?"
Buffy,"No. I mean, my feelings a little. What's wrong?"
Giles,"Nothing, nothing, nothing's wrong. I-I'm just in the, uh, middle  of something extremely important, and, uh, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have  to say good night now."
Giles,"Yes, I'm, I'm sorry to disturb you. It's, uh... I-I realize  it's, uh, five in the morning there, um... Uh, I-I'm trying to reach  Diedre Page. My name is Rupert Giles, uh, uh, she knows me. It's, it's  very important. (listens to the bad news) I'm terribly sorry. I... I-I  didn't know. W-when did she, uh, pass away? (listens more) Ohhhh. That  recently. (sits at his desk) Um, yes, yes, um, we were friends when we  were young. My condolences."
Giles,So. You're back.
Cordelia,This isn't right. School on a Saturday. It throws off my  internal clock.
Xander,When are we gonna need computers for real life anyway?
Jenny,"Hmm, let's see. There's home, school, work, games... (unlocks  the classroom door)"
Xander,"Y'know, computers are on the way out. I think paper's gonna  make a big comeback."
Willow,And the abacus.
Xander,"Yeah, you know, you don't see enough abaci."
Jenny,"Alright, guys. The first thing we're gonna do is... Buffy!"
Xander,Huh? Did I fall asleep already?
Willow,"Aw, you miss your friends?"
Xander,"Uh, sit here, Buffs! (stands up) Demilitarize the zone between  me and Cordelia!"
Cordelia,"Yeah, and delouse him while you're at it."
Buffy,(to Jenny) Actually I wanted to talk to you for a second?
Jenny,Something wrong?
Xander,Is there some crisis that requires instant action? Very far  from here?
Buffy,It's Giles.
Jenny,"Well, he's alright, isn't he?"
Buffy,"I don't know. Uh, he didn't show up when he was supposed to last  night, and then, when I went over to his place, he was acting... well,  very anti-Giles. He wouldn't let me in, and he looked really bad. I-I  think he might've been... (doesn't want to believe it) I think he was  drinking."
Jenny,He was home alone drinking?
Willow,"But... tea, right?"
Buffy,"Wasn't tea, Will."
Xander,"Yep, yep, I knew this would happen. Nobody can be wound as  straight and narrow as Giles without a dark side erupting. My Uncle  Roary was the stodgiest taxidermist you've ever met by day. By night,  it was booze, whores, and fur flying. Were there whores?"
Buffy,He was alone.
Xander,Give it time.
Buffy,"So, none of you guys have noticed anything different lately?"
Willow,No!
Jenny,Not really.
Buffy,"Uh, you haven't seen anything weird?"
Xander,Nope.
Cordelia,"No, he seemed perfectly normal yesterday when I saw him  talking to the police."
Buffy,And you waited till now to tell us this because...?
Cordelia,I didn't think it was important.
Xander,We understand. It wasn't about you.
Jenny,"Well, what were the police talking to him about?"
Cordelia,"Oh, don't tell me, I know this one. Um... (thinks) Something  about... a homicide."
Buffy,That's it. I-I'm calling him right now.
Buffy,I know you! You were in that costume shop.
Ethan,"Oh, I'm pleased you remember. (tries to go)"
Buffy,"(stops him) You sold me that dress for Halloween, and nearly got  us all killed!"
Ethan,But you looked great.
Ethan,Owww! (straightens back up holding his jaw) So now we're even?
Buffy,I'll let you know when we're even. What're you doing here?
Ethan,Snooping around.
Buffy,Honesty. Nice touch.
Ethan,It's one of my virtues. (smiles) Not really.
Buffy,"I've got a great idea: why don't I just call the police and have  you arrested for breaking and entering, and then I can get back to my  fun Saturday?"
Ethan,"Yes, the police. Well, they'll have all those questions, and  they'll really need Rupert to answer them all."
Buffy,You know Giles.
Ethan,"We go back. Way back. You don't happen to know where he is, do  you?"
Giles,Hello.
Buffy,"(cut to her) Giles, it's me."
Giles,"(cut to him) (exhales) Buffy, u-unless this is an emergency,  I'll see you on Monday."
Buffy,(cut to her) What's the Mark of Eyghon?
Buffy,Giles?
Ethan,Cat got his tongue?
Buffy,I'm in your office with someone who claims to be an old friend  of yours. (cut to Giles) Ethan Rayne?
Giles,"He's there with you? Listen, Buffy, you're... you're in grave  danger while Ethan's there. I want you to (cut to Buffy) put the phone  down and get out of the library as soon as possible."
Buffy,I'm not going anywhere until you give me some answers!
Giles,Buffy?
Philip,Ethan!
Buffy,Don't let him get away!
Willow,"I'm not gonna get close enough to feel his pulse, but... he  looks dead."
Xander,Except for the walking and attacking Buffy part.
Ethan,"He's dead. Sorry, Philip. Really I am."
Giles,Is everyone alright?
Cordelia,Super! (proud of herself) I kicked a guy!
Jenny,We're okay.
Xander,Deadguy here interrupted our tutorial. (to Philip) Been meaning  to thank you for that.
Giles,It can't be!
Ethan,"Yes, it can. (Giles turns to him) Hello, Ripper."
Giles,I thought I told you to leave town.
Ethan,You did. I didn't. (Giles approaches him) Shop's lease is paid  till the end of the month.
Cordelia,"(to Xander) Uh, why did he call him Ripper?"
Giles,You should've left when I told you.
Cordelia,Ohhhh...
Buffy,Giles?!
Giles,You put these people in danger. The people I care about.
Ethan,"If you cared so much about them, why didn't *you* leave town?  (pushes Giles' arm away) You've been having the dreams, I know. I have.  We both know what's coming."
Buffy,What dreams?! What is going on here?!
Ethan,"Tell her, Ripper."
Buffy,Giles...
Giles,JENNY!
Willow,"Now, there's something you don't see everyday."
Cordelia,I'm gonna be in therapy till I'm thirty.
Buffy,(looks around) Where's Ethan? (runs off) Where'd he go?
Giles,"Are you alright, Jenny?"
Jenny,Ow! (cradles her head in her hand)
Giles,Careful!
Jenny,Ohhh...
Giles,Can you stand? (helps her up)
Jenny,I think so.
Cordelia,This is what happens when you have school on Saturday.
Jenny,(unsteady) Mm.
Giles,Lean on me. (pulls her close) It'll be alright.
Jenny,(pulls away to look at him) Promise?
Giles,I promise.
Jenny,I believe you.
Giles,How's your head?
Jenny,Throbbing.
Buffy,"I lost Ethan. Giles, what's going on?"
Giles,"It's complicated, Buffy, and quite frankly, it's private."
Buffy,I don't care from private! I care from dead guys attacking us. I  care from you lost weekending in your apartment.
Giles,I wasn't... I was just trying to find a solution.
Buffy,"Giles, share! What is the Mark of Eyghon?"
Giles,"Hey! (stares her down) This is not your battle! And as your  Watcher, (stands up) I'm telling you unequivocally to stay out of it!"
Giles,I have to get Jenny home. (helps her up)
Jenny,Mm. Thank you.
Buffy,"We have work to do. Will, I want you to find out anything and  everything you can about the Mark of Eyghon."
Willow,"I'll try the 'Net, but 'Mark of Eyghon' sounds like Giles and  his books sorta deal."
Buffy,Then we hit the books.
Buffy,"Xander, how do you feel about digging through some of Giles'  personal files and seeing what you can find?"
Xander,I feel pretty good about it. Does that make me a sociopath?  Nah. (heads for the office)
Buffy,(raises her brows) What?
Cordelia,What about me? I care about Giles.
Buffy,"(thinks) Uh, work with Xander."
Cordelia,"Well, when I say 'care', I, I mean..."
Buffy,Cordelia...
Cordelia,"Okay, okay! (walks to the office)"
Jenny,Thanks for bringing me here. (cut inside the apartment) Not  quite ready to be home alone just yet.
Jenny,Ooo!
Giles,"Jenny, uh... I'm so very sorry about all of this. (sets down his  drink and takes off his glasses) I, uh... I never meant for you to be  involved in, in, uh, any of this."
Jenny,So I got involved. (leans forward) That's what happens when two  people get involved.
Giles,"I really am, however, gonna have to get you home. It's not,  uh... I'm not a very safe person to be around at the moment."
Jenny,"Nothing's safe in this world, Rupert. Don't you know that by  now?"
Willow,"Ah! Aha! It's not Egyptian, it's Etruscan (goes over to Buffy  with her book) mistaken for Egyptian by the design pattern, but any fool  can see it predates their iconology. Look, the Mark of Eyghon, worn by  his initiates. (reads) 'Eyghon, also called the Sleepwalker, can only  exist in this reality by possessing an unconscious host. Temporary  possession imbues the host with a euphoric feeling of power.'"
Buffy,"Yeah, but what about non-temporary?"
Willow,"(reads) 'Unless the proper rituals are observed, the possession  is permanent, and Eyghon will be born from within the host.'"
Cordelia,I'm guessing eww!
Willow,"Wait. Hey, listen. 'Once called, Eyghon can also take  possession of the dead, but its demonic energy soon disintegrates the  host, and it must jump to the nearest dead or unconscious person to  continue living.'"
Buffy,I still don't get what this has to do with Giles.
Willow,"I don't know about Giles, but ancient sects used to induce  possession for bacchanals and, and orgies."
Xander,Okay! Giles and orgies in the same sentence. I coulda lived  without that one.
Buffy,"Uh, wait a minute. The dead guy's all puddly now."
Cordelia,"So the demon's gone. There was no one dead to jump into. I  mean, we're all not dead, right?"
Buffy,"No, no one dead."
Xander,But someone unconscious.
Giles,What was that?
Jenny,What was what?
Giles,I thought I heard something. (comes out of the kitchen with tea)
Jenny,I didn't.
Giles,"Here. (hands her a cup) Drink that, and then I'll drive you  home."
Jenny,(takes a sip) You could take me home. (sets the cup down) Or you  could take advantage of me in my weakened state.
Buffy,"Thank you, operator. (hangs up) There's no answer at Ms.  Calendar's, and Giles' phone is out of order. I'm gonna go over there.  (strides out)"
Giles,"Jenny, uh... (moves away) I'm, I'm really very attracted t-to  you."
Jenny,Good. (follows)
Giles,"But, um, now really isn't the right time. (faces her)"
Jenny,"Oh, there's never been a better time."
Giles,It's not right. I would be taking advantage.
Jenny,"(gets off) God, you just don't change, do you? (paces)"
Giles,What?
Jenny,"It's not right, it wouldn't be proper, people might get hurt.  You're like a woman, Ripper. You cry at every funeral. You never had the  strength for me. You don't deserve me. (whispers) But guess what? You've  got me. (takes his head) (in a deep male voice) Under your skin."
Buffy,Back off!
Buffy,Are you alright?
Giles,"Oh, Jenny! Oh, God!"
Buffy,"Giles, how do we stop this?"
Giles,"Oh, God, what have I done?"
Buffy,"Talk to me! Giles, you're scaring me."
Giles,I'm sorry.
Buffy,"Don't be sorry, be Giles. C'mon, we fight monsters. This is what  we do. They show up, they scare us, I beat 'em up and they go away. This  isn't any different!"
Giles,It *is* different.
Buffy,Because you don't know how to stop it?
Giles,Because I created it!
Willow,Did you find anything?
Xander,"The most meticulous banking and phone records you've ever seen.  And, um, this."
Willow,(giggles) That's Giles?
Giles,"I was twenty-one, studying history at Oxford. And, of course,  the occult by night. I hated it. The tedious grind of study, the...  overwhelming pressure of my destiny. I dropped out, I went to London...  (exhales) I fell in with the worst crowd that would have me. We  practiced magicks. Small stuff for pleasure or gain. And Ethan and I  discovered something... bigger."
Buffy,Eyghon.
Giles,"Yes. One of us would, um... (nervously pours a drink) go into a  deep sleep, and the others would, uh, summon him. It was an  extraordinary high! (smiles nervously) God, we were fools."
Buffy,You couldn't control it.
Giles,"One of us, Randall, he lost control. Eyghon took him whole. We  tried to exorcise the demon from Randall, but it killed him. No. We  killed him. We thought we were free of the demon after that. But now  he's back. And one by one, he will kill us all."
Buffy,"Three down, two to go?"
Buffy,Then it's going after Ethan. (gets up) I better beat it there.
Giles,(gets up) *We'd* better.
Buffy,"*I'd* better. Giles, you're barely mobile, and speed is of a  serious essence here."
Giles,(sits back down) I don't know how to stop it without killing  Jenny.
Buffy,"I've got the guys working on it. I'll, um, try to contain it  until we figure something. (starts to go)"
Giles,Buffy? (she stops) I'm sorry.
Buffy,I know. (leaves)
Buffy,"Ethan? (comes in and closes the door) Ethan? (looks around)  Giles told me everything. Look, it's coming for you."
Ethan,(appears behind her) And you came to protect me? I'm touched.
Buffy,"Don't worry, it's nothing personal. To protect Giles I have to  protect you. (walks past him)"
Ethan,How does Ripper inspire such goodness?
Buffy,'Cause he's Giles.
Ethan,"And I'm not. Still, lucky me."
Buffy,Hmm. Lucky you.
Ethan,"Well, we can't run. Eyghon will find us. (shows his tattoo) This  mark's like a homing beacon."
Buffy,That's okay. I'm not much into running.
Ethan,Aren't we manly?
Buffy,One of us is. You're gonna hide till it's over.
Ethan,Excellent plan.
Buffy,Is there a way in through the back?
Ethan,"Uh, there's a back door. It's locked. I think it's solid."
Buffy,We'll set up there. Let's go.
Ethan,"Oh, no, please."
Ethan,Ladies first.
Ethan,"Wakey, wakey. You're missing all the fun."
Buffy,What fun?
Ethan,Your initiation.
Buffy,You know what? I'm not real interested in joining your club.
Ethan,"Too late. I already voted you in. (she struggles) Y'know, I hope  you're not taking this personally, Buffy. I actually kinda like you.  It's ju, it's just that I like myself a whole lot more. If you think of  it karmically, this is, this is really big for your soul."
Ethan,"You know, taking my place with the demon, giving so that others  may live."
Buffy,I'm gonna kill you. Will that blow the whole karma thing?
Ethan,"Sweet child. (takes the tattoo ink and needle) Now, this may  sting a little just at first. But don't worry, that'll go away once the  searing pain kicks in."
Ethan,You can go ahead and scream if you like.
Willow,"We have to figure out how to kill this thing, and we need to do  it fast. (takes a sip of tea)"
Xander,"(reads) Uh, 'hot lava.'"
Willow,That's for a heretic.
Xander,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, ooo, ooo! 'Bury a potato!' No,  that's for warts. Who writes this stuff?"
Cordelia,I've got the solution right here. 'To kill a demon cut off  its head.'
Xander,"Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah! We'll, uh, find Ms. Calendar, then  we'll decapitate her. Hey! She'll be the first headless computer teacher  in school. You think anybody'll notice?"
Cordelia,"Do you know what you need, Xander, besides a year's supply of  acne cream? A brain."
Xander,"(Gets up) That's it! Twelve years of you and I'm snappin'! I  don't care if you're a girl or not, I'm throwin' down! Come on!"
Cordelia,(gets up and walks to him) I've seen you fight. And don't  think I can't take you!
Xander,Give it your best shot.
Willow,"(had enough, gets up) HEY! We don't have time for this! Our  friends are in trouble! Now, we have to put our heads together and, and  get them out of it! And if you two aren't with me a hundred and ten  percent, then get the hell out of my library! (points to the door)"
Cordelia,(meekly) We're sorry.
Xander,We'll be good.
Willow,"(nods and sits) Okay. Now, we've done the research. We just  have to figure out how to use it."
Xander,"Oh, hey! Why don't we find another dead body for the demon to  jump into!"
Cordelia,Yes! At the cemetery.
Willow,"Well, that won't kill the demon. It'll only give it a change of  scenery. (something clicks) Oh. Oh! Oh, I've got it! (runs for the  phone) I've got it!"
Xander,She's good! (follows)
Ethan,Hmm. I think I missed my calling as an artist.
Buffy,"Ethan, listen to me. This is a bad idea. You're dealing with  something very dangerous."
Ethan,(rolls up his left sleeve) But it will get Eyghon off my scent.
Ethan,Now relax. I'm finished with you. This is for me.
Giles,Oh! Ethan... No. No!
Ethan,"Well, I hate to mutilate and run, but..."
Giles,Eyghon! Take me.
Giles,"Buffy, get out of here!"
Buffy,NO! (gets between them) No!
Giles,He's killing her!
Willow,No! Trust me! This is gonna work!
Giles,Jenny!
Giles,Jenny!
Jenny,Rupert...
Buffy,You knew that if the demon was in trouble it was gonna jump into  the nearest dead person.
Angel,I put it in danger.
Willow,And it jumped. (stands up)
Angel,(gets up) I've had a demon inside me for a couple hundred  years... (exhales) just waitin' for a good fight.
Buffy,Winner and still champion.
Xander,"Uh, I think that Ethan guy disappeared again."
Buffy,Darn. I really wanted to hit him till he bled.
Cordelia,"Well, at least it's over."
Buffy,"You know what the worst thing is? I was saving up for some very  important shoes, and now I have to blow my entire allowance to get this  stupid tattoo removed. Let's just hope my mom doesn't see it first."
Xander,"Puttin' that demon into Angel was pretty brill, Will."
Willow,I wasn't sure it was gonna work.
Buffy,But it did.
Xander,Like a charm.
Buffy,Hey! Maybe you should consider a career as a Watcher.
Willow,"Oh, no, I don't think I could handle the stress."
Xander,And the dental plan is crap.
Willow,I don't see how Giles does it.
Buffy,I don't think he has a choice.
Giles,"Uh, uh, Jenny! Jenny..."
Jenny,"Rupert, hi."
Giles,"Uh... I-I-I tried to call you last night, s-see how you were."
Jenny,"Yeah, I-I-I, uh... I left my phone off the hook. I seem to need  a lot of sleep lately."
Giles,"But, but you're al-alright? Is, is, is there anything you need?"
Jenny,"Mm, no, I'm fine. I mean, I'm not... running around, wind in my  hair, 'the hills are alive with the sound of music' fine, but... I'm  coping."
Giles,"I, I would like to help."
Jenny,I know.
Giles,"Perhaps we could, um, talk sometime, um... dinner, or, or a  drink? When you're feeling stronger."
Jenny,"Sure, sometime."
Jenny,Yeah. Sometime. (pauses) I better get to class.
Giles,"Yes, of course."
Buffy,Hey.
Buffy,Is she okay?
Giles,Um... The hills are not alive.
Buffy,(doesn't understand) I'm sorry to hear that. I think.
Giles,I don't think she'll ever really forgive me. Maybe she  shouldn't.
Buffy,Maybe you should.
Giles,I never wanted you to see that side of me.
Buffy,"I'm not gonna lie to you. It was scary. I'm so used to you being  a grownup, and (inhales) then I find out that you're a person."
Giles,Most grownups are.
Buffy,Who would've thought?
Giles,"Some are even, uh... shortsighted, foolish people."
Buffy,"So, after all this time, we finally find out that we *do* have  something in common. Which, apart from being a little weird, is kind of  okay. (pauses) I think we're supposed to be training right now."
Giles,"Yes. Yes. Um, need to concentrate on your flexibility."
Buffy,"And you know what? I have just the perfect music. (holds up a  black CD) Go on, say it. You know you want to."
Giles,"It's not music, it's just, uh, meaningless sounds."
Buffy,There. Feel better?
Giles,Yes. Thanks.
Giles,"Bay City Rollers. Now, that's music."
Buffy,I didn't hear that.
