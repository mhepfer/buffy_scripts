Buffy,"We haven't been properly introduced. (pulls out a stake) I'm  Buffy, and you're history!"
Giles,"(pops up from behind a crypt) Poor technique. (comes around to  her) Prioritizing, sub-par... Execution was adequate, but a bit too  bloody for my taste."
Buffy,"Giles, don't mention it. It was my *pleasure* to make the world  safe for humanity again."
Giles,"I'm not saying that your methods are without merit, it's, uh, y- you're spending too much time and energy. It should simply be: plunge,  and move on. Plunge and... (notices something on the ground) Hello.  (bends over to pick up a ring with his pen)"
Buffy,"(sees the ring) Oh, that's great! I kill 'em, you fence their  stuff. (Giles gives her a look) What is it?"
Giles,I don't know.
Buffy,But it bothers you.
Giles,"Yes! Well, I... I thought this vampire was just on a random  kill, but it may be something else."
Buffy,Something big?
Giles,Yes. I'd best consult my books.
Master,"'And there will be a time of crisis, of worlds hanging in the  balance. And in this time shall come the Anointed, the Master's great  warrior. And the Slayer will not know him, will not stop him, and he  will lead her into Hell.' As it is written, so shall it be. (picks up  the book and walks) 'Five will die, and from their ashes the Anointed  shall rise. The Brethren of Aurelius shall greet him and usher him to  his immortal destiny.' (stops by one of the brethren) As it is written,  so shall it be. 'And one of the brethren shall go out hunting the night  before and get himself killed, because he couldn't wait to finish his  job before he ate.' Oh, wait. (grabs one of the brethren by the throat)  That's not written anywhere. (lifts the vampire from his feet) The  Anointed will be my greatest weapon against the Slayer! If you fail to  bring him to me, if you allow that girl to stop you... (throws the  vampire into a coffin) Here endeth the lesson."
Giles,"That symbol on the ring... I believe it's the rune for fidelity,  but, uh, it doesn't connect with any of the sects that I've studied."
Buffy,What about this? (shows him the ring) On the inside. It's a sun  and three stars. Haven't we seen that somewhere?
Giles,"Let me see. (takes the ring and looks closely) No, I-I don't  think this, um, represents any..."
Buffy,"(looks in a book) Wait, it's right here. Sun and three stars.  Yuck, check these guys out. (hands Giles the open book) Told you it  looked familiar."
Giles,"Oh, the Order of Aurelius. Yes, you're right."
Buffy,"Ooo, two points for the Slayer, while the Watcher has yet to  score!"
Buffy,Oh! (slides off the table) Owen! Hi!
Giles,(looks up at Owen) What do you want?
Owen,A book?
Giles,Oh!
Buffy,"(to Giles) See, this is a school, and we have students, and they  check out books, and then they learn things."
Giles,I was beginning to suspect that was a myth.
Owen,"I lost my Emily. Dickinson. It's dumb, but I like her around.  Kind of a security blanket."
Buffy,"(awkwardly) I have something like that. Well, it's an actual  blanket. Uh, and I don't really carry it around anym-more... So! Emily  Dickens, huh? She's great!"
Owen,Dickinson.
Buffy,She's good also.
Giles,(points at the stacks) Poetry.
Owen,(to Buffy) I didn't think I'd find you here. (goes up the stairs)
Buffy,(follows Owen) W... Why not?
Owen,"I, I didn't mean... I mean... I think you can read."
Buffy,Thanks.
Owen,"But you don't seem bookwormy. (finds his book) The type of person  to lock themselves in a dark room with a lotta musty old books. (looks  up from the book) Oh, and I've offended you."
Buffy,"No! No, I'm just surprised you gave any thought to what I'm  like."
Owen,You shouldn't be. (starts back down)
Buffy,"(follows again) Oh, well, I *love* books. I mean, I really  *love* books."
Owen,What's this?
Buffy,(gets between him and the book) Not this one.
Giles,(picks the book up) This one she doesn't love.
Giles,"Oh, Emily Dickinson."
Buffy,We're both fans.
Giles,"Yes, uh, she's quite a good poet, I mean for a... (takes Owen's  library card)"
Buffy,A girl?
Giles,For an American. (scans the book and library card)
Owen,"(to Buffy) I'll, uh, see you in math... if I open my eyes at some  point. (takes the card and book from Giles)"
Buffy,Cool...
Giles,"The Order of Aurelius is a very old and venerated sect. If  they're here, it's for a good reason."
Buffy,That was Owen!
Giles,"Yes, I remember."
Buffy,Do you have any more copies of Emily Dickinson? I need one.
Giles,"(exasperated) Buffy, while the mere fact of you wanting to check  out a book would be grounds for a national holiday, I think we should  focus on the problem at hand."
Buffy,"Right. I'm sorry, you're right. Vampires. (looks down at her  dress) Oh. (looks inquisitively at Giles) Does this outfit make me look  fat?"
Willow,Owen Thurman was talking to you?
Buffy,It's all true.
Willow,"Wow! He hardly talks to anyone. He's solitary, mysterious... He  can brood for forty minutes straight, I've clocked him."
Buffy,"He was so nice, it was eerie."
Willow,What did you guys have to talk about?
Buffy,(heads for a table) Emily Dickinson.
Willow,"(follows) He reads Emily Dickinson? He's sensitive, yet manly!  (Buffy sets down her tray) Well, wait, you've never even read her."
Willow,You vixen! (they both sit)
Xander,(holds up his fork) Has anybody given any thought to what this  green stuff is?
Buffy,"Hmm, I'm avoiding the subject."
Xander,"I think it's kale, or possibly string cheese. (lets the fork  drop) So, Buffy, how'd the slaying go last night?"
Buffy,(gives him a stern look) Xander!
Xander,"I mean, how'd the *laying* go? (gets another look from Buffy)  No, I don't mean that either."
Buffy,"It went fine, thank you. There's some new hoidy-toidy vampire  sect in town."
Willow,That's bad.
Xander,"Well, hey, they're bringing in the much needed tourist dollars.  (sees Owen) Ooo, look at Mr. Excitement."
Buffy,Owen! He's all alone! Maybe somebody should sit with him.
Willow,"Mm, just to be polite! (Buffy gets up) Good luck!"
Xander,"(to Willow) Okay, what just happened?"
Cordelia,"Look, an empty seat! (bumps Buffy)"
Buffy,(spills her tray) Ooo! Ew...
Owen,Let me get that. (bends down)
Buffy,Thanks! (crouches) Boy! Cordelia's hips are wider than I  thought!
Cordelia,(sarcastically) Eh-heh!
Owen,At least you don't have to eat your Soylent Green.
Cordelia,"(trying to get attention) Owen, a bunch of us are loitering  at the Bronze tonight. You there?"
Owen,Who's all going?
Cordelia,"Well, um, I'm gonna be there."
Owen,Who else?
Cordelia,You mean besides me?
Owen,"(to Buffy) Buffy, what about you?"
Buffy,What?
Cordelia,"No, no, no! She, uh, she doesn't like fun."
Owen,(to Buffy) How 'bout we meet there at eight?
Buffy,(smiles) Yeah! Eight! There!
Buffy,It's not that big a deal. It's just a bunch of people getting  together.
Willow,It's a very big deal!
Buffy,It's not!
Willow,It is. (spots Giles) Tell her!
Giles,I'm afraid it's very big.
Willow,"(smiles at Buffy) Thank you! (turns back to Giles, confused)  Wait!"
Willow,What are you talking about?
Giles,What are *you* talking about?
Giles,"Yes, well, I'm talking about trouble. A violent and disturbing  prophecy is about to be fulfilled."
Buffy,The Order of Aurelius.
Giles,"You were spot-on about the connection. (walks over to the table)  I've looked at the writings of Aurelius himself, and he, he prophesied  that the brethren of his order would come to the Master and bring him  the Anointed."
Willow,Who's that?
Giles,"Well, I-I don't know exactly, a-a-a-a warrior, but, but it says  he will rise from the ashes of the Five on the evening of the thousandth  day after the Advent of Septus."
Buffy,"Well, we'll be ready whenever it is."
Giles,Which is tonight.
Buffy,"(takes in the information) Tonight, okay... (realizes the  conflict) Not okay! It can't be tonight!"
Giles,My calculations are precise.
Buffy,Nuh! They're bad calculations! Bad!
Willow,Buffy has a really important date.
Buffy,Owen!
Giles,"Alright, I-I'll just jump in my time machine, go back to the  twelfth century and ask the vampires to postpone their ancient prophecy  for a few days while you take in dinner and a show."
Buffy,"Okay, at this point you're abusing sarcasm."
Giles,"Buffy, this is no ordinary vampire. But we have to stop him  before he reaches the Master."
Buffy,But... Cute guy! Teenager! Post-pubescent fantasies!
Giles,"Those will just have to be put on hold! The dark forces are  aligning against us, and we have a chance to beat them back. Tonight we  go into battle!"
Giles,(sniffs) Perhaps I miscalculated.
Buffy,I'm thinking yes. (sucks her drink dry)
Giles,"Well, you know what they say. Ninety percent of the vampire  slaying game is, is waiting."
Buffy,You couldn't have told me that ninety percent ago?
Giles,"Well, we, we've certainly waited here long enough. (gets up)"
Buffy,"Besides, there aren't any fresh graves. Who's gonna rise?"
Giles,Apparently no one tonight.
Buffy,(jumps up) Then I can bail? I can go to the Bronze and find  Owen?
Giles,"Oh, very well then. Follow your hormones if you want. (Buffy  hops down and starts to go) But I assume I don't have to warn you about  the hazards of becoming personally involved with someone who's unaware  of your unique condition."
Buffy,"Yeah, yeah, I read the back of the box."
Giles,If your identity as the Slayer is revealed it could put you and  all those around you in grave danger.
Buffy,"Well, in that case I won't wear my button that says, 'I'm a  Slayer. Ask me how!' (gets a look from Giles) Good night. (leaves)"
Giles,"'Five shall die, and from their ashes the Anointed shall rise.'  I was sure it was tonight."
Collin,(to Andrew) I went on an airplane.
Andrew,A pale horse emerged with death as its rider. You will be  judged. You will be judged.
Lyrics,<I>...is real / Then you wake up shouting some familiar name /  It's not the same</I>
Lyrics,"<I>You're just a girl / Just a girl who knows no shame / Whose  desperate pace has lost its taste / A never-ending darkness weighs / I  can't avoid, I can't complain / I know exactly who's to blame / The girl  who shares my...</I>"
Andrew,"That day's gonna bring fire. Fire comin' down! Judgment! (to  Collin and his mom) Don't think you're ready, ready to look upon him. If  there's sin in there, there's sin all around. It's a liquid. On that day  there won't be anybody tellin' us what to do or why we're doin' it. You  can't prepare. On that day..."
Driver,"(to Andrew) Hey, you gotta sit down. Okay?"
Andrew,Are you willing to stand with the righteous?
Driver,(looks back at the passengers) Is everyone okay?
Driver,(to victim) Are you all right? (kneels down beside him) Can you  move?
Xander,So you just went home?
Buffy,"What was I supposed to do? Say to Owen, 'Sorry I was late, I was  sitting in a cemetery with the librarian waiting for a vampire to rise  so I could prevent an evil prophecy from coming to pass?'"
Xander,(weighs options with his hands) Or flat tire?
Buffy,"(starts walking) I can't take this anymore. I feel like everyone  is staring at me, the big, hideous, dateless monster. (to a passing  student) What? Yeah, that's right, I have no life, c'mon, nothin' to see  here, pal, move it along!"
Xander,"You're acting a little overly, aren't you? I mean, you could  have any guy in school."
Buffy,He's not any guy. He's more... Oweny.
Xander,"Sure, he's got a certain Owenosity, but that's not hard to  find. (they reach his locker) I mean, a lotta guys read. (with a goofy  smile) I can read."
Owen,"Hey, Buffy!"
Buffy,Owen!
Xander,"Oh, look, it's Owen. (gets a look from Buffy) Buffy and Owen.  And Xander. That'd be me."
Owen,W-where were you last night?
Buffy,"Oh. Well, um, my watch broke and we don't have any clocks in our  house and so I didn't know what time it was or even what day it was..."
Owen,I thought I was the only one that happened to. How 'bout we try  it again for tonight? I'll even lend you my watch.
Buffy,Tonight? Y-you and me?
Owen,"Well, we could invite the chess club, but they drink and they  start fights..."
Buffy,"Oh, no, it's just... Well, I... sort of heard that... you and  Cordelia were... somewhat... all over each other. A little..."
Owen,I danced with her a couple of times. (with a look of distaste)  She's kinda grabby.
Buffy,"Oh, well, let's see, if I rearrange that, and I push that to  n... Sure! Tonight'll work!"
Owen,Great! I'll pick you up at seven?
Buffy,"Um, seven!"
Owen,That's when the little hand's (points on the pocket watch) there.
Buffy,Oh! Between the six and the eight.
Owen,"Um, I'll see you then! (leaves)"
Buffy,(watches him go) Tonight! Isn't that so?
Xander,What?
Buffy,(dreamily) Me and Owen! (walks off)
Xander,"(feeling down) Yeah, so it is. (closes his locker) It sure is  so."
Buffy,"Hey, how's it going?"
Giles,"Uh, alright."
Buffy,"That's great! I see we're still working on that Anointed One  problem, that'll probably take you a few days, right? I mean, that's one  obscure prophecy..."
Giles,"Well, yes, there are a few interpretations..."
Buffy,"So tonight's looking slow, right? Probably best to relax and  regroup, no big disasters coming, that is *so* good, I will see you  tomorrow then! Bye! (leaves quickly)"
Giles,She is the strangest girl.
Master,"You have done well. Everything is in place. When this night's  work is done, I will have a mighty ally. I'll be one step closer to  freeing myself from this... mystical prison. (feels his confines) I've  been trapped down here so long I've nearly forgotten what it's like on  the surface. Well, there'll be time enough to remember... when I rule  it! If she tries to stop you, kill her. Give your own lives, but do not  fail to bring the Anointed. I know you won't disappoint me. (quickly  grabs a fly from the air) Bug!"
Willow,Pick!
Buffy,"(to Xander) Okay, (Willow holds up one minidress) do I wanna  appear shy, coy and naive or (Willow holds up the other) unrestrained,  insatiable and aggressive?"
Xander,"(watching from the bed) Uh, y'know, Owen is a little home spun,  he probably doesn't like that overly assertive look. (goes to her  closet) Oh, hey, here's something. A nice comfy overcoat and a ski cap!  (holds them up to her) The earflaps will bring out your eyes!"
Buffy,"Maybe I should mix and match. (Willow nods) Okay, guy's opinion.  (grabs two lipsticks from her desk) Which one do you think Owen will  like better? (holds them up) The red or the peach?"
Xander,"Oh, you mean for kissing you and then telling all his friends  how easy you are so the whole school loses respect for you and then  talks behind your back? The red's fine."
Buffy,Thanks. I'll go with the peach. (puts on the lipstick)
Willow,"(hands Buffy a third minidress) Here, put this on."
Xander,You're not bothering me!
Willow,"(to Buffy) So, where's he taking you?"
Buffy,"Oh, I don't know. Where do you suppose young kids go on dates  these days? (unties her bathrobe)"
Willow,"Well, I read somewhere once that sometimes they go to movies."
Buffy,(finishes pulling on the minidress) Movies! Interesting!
Willow,"And I saw on TV once, a bunch of people our age went to a  party."
Buffy,(pulls on a boot) Wow! I never knew being a teenager was so full  of possibilities! (pulls on the other boot)
Buffy,(excited) That's Owen!
Buffy,That's Giles.
Giles,We need to talk.
Buffy,Buffy's not home. (tries to close the door)
Giles,(pushes the door open and comes in) My calculations may not have  been as far off as I thought. (holds up a newspaper)
Buffy,(reads) 'Five Die in Van Accident'?
Giles,Out of the ashes of five shall rise the one. That's the  prophecy. Five people have died!
Buffy,In a car crash.
Giles,"I know it doesn't quite follow, but, but it's worth  investigating. Look! Among the dead was Andrew Borba, whom the police  sought for questioning in a double murder. Now, he may be the Anointed  One. The, the bodies have been taken to, to Sunnydale Funeral Home, w-we  can..."
Buffy,"(interrupts) Giles, why do you wanna hurt me?"
Giles,I beg your pardon?
Owen,"(shows up at the open door) Hey! (comes in) Uh, hi!"
Giles,You have a date?
Buffy,"Yes, but I will return those overdue books by tomorrow."
Giles,"Wait, you're not getting off that easily."
Owen,"Man, you really care about your work!"
Willow,"(thinking quickly) Uh, Owen?"
Xander,"Yeah, a couple of things about tonight."
Giles,Another date? Don't you ever do anything else?
Buffy,"This is the first date! There's never been a date, okay? This is  my maiden voyage!"
Owen,"What, she doesn't like to dance?"
Xander,"Well, it's a little too late to do anything about that. Uh, you  should probably know that Buffy doesn't like to be kissed. Actually she  doesn't like to be touched."
Willow,Xander...
Xander,"As a matter of fact, don't even look at her."
Buffy,We don't even know if this is anything.
Giles,"No, we don't."
Buffy,And I haven't had a day off in a while.
Giles,True...
Buffy,And a cranky Slayer is a careless Slayer!
Giles,"Buffy, maintaining a normal social life as a Slayer... i-i-is  problematic at best."
Buffy,"This is the 90's. The 1990's, in point of fact, and I can do  both. Clark Kent has a job. I just wanna go on a date."
Giles,"Well, I, I suppose it was a fairly slim lead..."
Buffy,"(pleased) Thank you, thank you, thank you! And look, I won't go  far, okay? If the apocalypse comes, beep me."
Owen,(comes back) Is everything cool?
Buffy,All set.
Giles,"Yes, and, uh, you'll face a pretty hefty fine in the morning."
Buffy,"Well, bye. Don't wait up. (leaves quickly with Owen)"
Willow,Is something going on?
Giles,"Oh, uh, probably not, no. I, uh, I suppose I'll just, uh, go to  the funeral home in case, just see if anything comes up. (leaves)"
Willow,"(to Xander, concerned) This is bad."
Xander,I wish it was just bad.
Willow,We should... go along.
Xander,"Yeah, you're right. I don't trust that Owen guy. It's the eyes.  Crazy!"
Willow,"Xander, we should go with Giles! He could get in trouble!"
Xander,"Oh, he's gone, uh, it's, he's gonna be alright. He's like super  librarian, y'know? Everyone forgets, Willow, that knowledge is the  ultimate weapon."
Lyrics,"<I>I'll be right along / 'Cause, baby, you're so strong</I>"
Owen,"The thing about Emily Dickinson I love is, is she's just so  incredibly morbid. A lot of loss, a lot of death... It gets me. With a  lot about bees, for some reason."
Buffy,Did she have a tragic and romantic life? With a lotta bees?
Owen,Quiet. Kind of sequestered and uneventful. Which I can really  relate to. I... don't get out much.
Buffy,I don't get that.
Owen,"It's my fault. I just find most girls pretty frivolous. I mean,  there's a lot more important things in life than dating, y'know? (Buffy  looks down at her beeper) Oh. Did I say something wrong?"
Buffy,"Uh, no! Come on."
Lyrics,"<I>Baby, baby, I know it's always been so / Physical love is, oh,  so meaningful for you</I>"
Owen,It's weird.
Buffy,What is?
Owen,"You! One minute you're right there. I've got you figured. The  next, it's like you're two people."
Buffy,Really? Which one do you like better?
Owen,I'll let you know.
Lyrics,"<I>So strong / Baby, I'm yours / You know / Because you're so / So  strong</I>"
Cordelia,"Aren't there laws against this sort of thing? (walks over to  Buffy and Owen) Owen! Look at you, here all alone..."
Lyrics,"<I>You're so, so strong</I>"
Owen,"Cordelia, I'm here with Buffy."
Cordelia,Oh! Okay. Do you wanna dance?
Owen,"No, I'm still here with Buffy."
Cordelia,You are so good to help the needy.
Buffy,"Cordelia, Owen and I would like to be alone right now, and for  that to happen, you would have to go somewhere that's away."
Cordelia,"(gives Buffy a look) (to Owen) Well, when you're ready for  the big leagues, let me know. (leaves)"
Lyrics,"<I>You would suffer, suffer for me</I>"
Giles,Damn!
Lyrics,<I>I have a window in my mind / I can turn to look right through  you</I>
Owen,"Are you, uh, having fun?"
Buffy,Yeah. I almost feel like a girl.
Lyrics,<I>Won't cost you anything but time / To see me feel like you do</I>
Giles,(startled) AH!
Willow,"(Willow and Xander raise the window sash) Giles, it's us!"
Giles,What are you doing here?
Xander,We saw two guys going in after you. Are they...
Giles,"(looks at the door) They are! (looks back) Uh, listen, you  should get to safety."
Willow,Can you get out this window?
Giles,(tests the bars) I'm afraid not.
Xander,"Look, I hate to state the obvious, but this looks like a job  for Buffy?"
Giles,"Uh, she has her, her... beeping thing! (looks around) Um, no  phone, of course."
Xander,"Look, we'll get her, just, uh, hang in there. (Willow and  Xander leave)"
Giles,(worried) Do hurry.
Owen,Do you want something to eat?
Buffy,Sure. Just make it something fattening.
Cordelia,"(looking on from the shadows by a door) What a disgusting  display. Is that really appropriate behavior in a public forum? I mean,  I've never seen a girl throw herself at a guy like that. Uhhh!"
Cordelia,"Ooo! Hello, salty goodness! (to her friend) Pick up the  phone, call 911. That boy is gonna need some serious oxygen after I'm  through with him."
Angel,Buffy.
Buffy,Angel.
Cordelia,(to herself) Why is this happening to me?
Angel,(to Buffy) I was hoping I'd find you here.
Buffy,You were?
Angel,Some serious stuff happening tonight. You need to be out there.
Buffy,"No, not you, too. (tries to leave)"
Angel,(stops her) What do you know?
Buffy,"Prophecy, Anointed One, yada, yada, yada..."
Angel,So you know. Fine. I just thought I'd warn you.
Buffy,Warn me? You see that guy over there at the bar? (walks around  him and faces Owen) He came here to be with me.
Angel,You're here on a date?
Buffy,(turns to Angel) Yes! Why is it such a shock to everyone?
Owen,(returns) Here you go.
Buffy,"Oh. (looks between Angel and Owen) Um, Owen, this is Angel.  Angel, this is Owen. (puts her arm around him) Who is my date."
Angel,Hey.
Owen,Hey! So. Where do you know Buffy from?
Angel,Work.
Owen,(to Buffy) You work?
Willow,Buffy!
Owen,Look at this! You show up everywhere. Interesting.
Xander,(points at Owen) You don't know the half of it. (points at  Angel) What's he doing here?
Angel,I guess it's the same thing you're doin' here.
Buffy,"Uh, excuse me, what are *any* of you doing here?"
Xander,"Look, we gotta get to, uh... (Willow kicks him) Uhhhh. We  thought it'd be fun if, uh, we made this a double date!"
Buffy,I didn't know you guys were seeing each other.
Willow,"Oh, yeah, well, we knew it would happen eventually, so we  figured, hey! Why fight it?"
Owen,And you guys are thinking double?
Xander,'Cause of... (laughs nervously) ...the fun!
Owen,(to Angel) And you're here because of work?
Xander,"Hey, maybe we should all go somewhere together."
Buffy,"Gee, that's so nice of you to ask, but Owen and I were, well,  sort of... Owen and I."
Xander,You know what'd be cool? The Sunnydale Funeral Home!
Willow,(emphasizing) I've always wanted to go there!
Buffy,The funeral home?
Owen,"Actually, that sounds kinda cool! Do you think we could all sneak  in?"
Xander,We saw some guys in there before. They seemed to be (pointedly  to Buffy) having fun!
Buffy,(to herself) Bite me!
Buffy,"(exhales) (to Owen) Um, Owen, I gotta go."
Owen,I thought we were going to the funeral home.
Buffy,"No, you can't. I'll tell you what. I'll be back in a little  while."
Owen,Buffy... (leads her away) What's the deal? Do you wanna bail on  me?
Buffy,"No! No... no... uh... You remember when you said I was like two  different people? Well, one of them has to go. But the other one is  having a really, really good time, and will come back. I promise."
Owen,(to Angel) She's the strangest girl!
Buffy,Which way?
Willow,The room's around back.
Buffy,Damn it!
Owen,(appears behind them) This is so cool!
Buffy,"Uh, Owen! You can't be here!"
Owen,"Oh, and I suppose you guys are allowed? What are we doin' here?  Are we gonna see a dead body?"
Buffy,"Possibly several. (to Xander and Willow) Guys, watch him. (runs  back the way they came)"
Owen,Is she mad?
Willow,"Oh, she just wants to make sure there're no guards so we don't  get in trouble."
Owen,Good thinking.
Xander,(to Willow) Good thinking.
Buffy,Giles?
Buffy,Giles!
Giles,"It *is* you. Oh, good."
Buffy,What happened?
Giles,"Uh, two more of the brethren came in here. They came after me.  But I was more than a match for them."
Buffy,Meaning...?
Giles,"I hid. Uh, this, uh, chap was good enough to bunk with me till  they went away. (he jumps down off of the cadaver)"
Buffy,"Well, w-were they here after you, or w-was it that prophecy  thing?"
Giles,"Ah, well, that's what we have to find out. I don't know what  these brethren mean to do exactly. Find the Anointed, or, or, or, or  give him something perhaps, uh, it's all, all very vague. And the  Anointed may be long gone!"
Buffy,But he may not be.
Giles,We must find out.
Buffy,"Okay, I just need to get Owen and the others out of harm's way  first."
Giles,Owen? You brought a date?
Buffy,"(exhales) I didn't bring him, he came."
Giles,"Buffy, when I said you could slay vampires and have a social  life, I didn't mean at the same time."
Buffy,I know. I'll get rid of him. (starts to leave)
Giles,"Y-you can't make him go out there alone, we don't know where the  brethren are. I-I'll just..."
Buffy,"No! No, Giles, he sees you, he's gonna have more questions than  he already does right now. I'll take care of it."
Willow,Is everything okay?
Buffy,It is.
Xander,And we'll be leaving?
Owen,We're not done lookin' around yet!
Buffy,"No, he's right. So let's find a nice, safe, fun room to look  around in."
Owen,"We tried the office here, but it's locked."
Buffy,(breaks the lock) No it's not! (goes in)
Owen,"Well, I don't think we'll find much in here."
Buffy,(looks around) That's the plan.
Owen,Okay. (confused) What?
Buffy,"(finished looking) I have to go now. (laughs nervously) Um, to  the bathroom, I have to go to the bathroom. If you hear anything, like a  security guard or something, just be really quiet. (to Willow and  Xander) And barricade the door."
Buffy,"(opens one) Ewww, parts!"
Giles,"Keep looking, he must be here somewhere."
Owen,What are you guys doing?
Willow,"Uh, just in case!"
Owen,"Oh, my!"
Buffy,Nothing.
Giles,The Anointed must be gone.
Buffy,"I guess. I mean, this is where they keep all the dead bodies,  right?"
Giles,Mm-hmm.
Owen,"I read a lot about death, but... but I've... never really seen a  dead body before."
Owen,Do they... usually move?
Andrew,I have been judged!
Owen,What's goin' on?
Buffy,"Oh, no!"
Andrew,(laughs) He is risen in me! He fills my head with song!
Andrew,Pork and beans. Pork and beans!
Xander,(to Willow) Gimme that!
Andrew,I can smell you.
Andrew,"You're the chaff, unblessed. I'll suck the blood from your  hearts, he says I may!"
Xander,He's in there!
Buffy,"Uh, go! Get out!"
Xander,She'll be okay. C'mon!
Andrew,"<I>Shall we gather at the river? / The beautiful, the beautiful  river?</I>"
Willow,I think he's coming this way!
Owen,"Oh, God, this is too much!"
Buffy,What've you got?
Giles,What?
Buffy,What'd you bring? Do you have a stake?
Giles,"Oh, uh... (hands her a stake.)"
Buffy,Thank you! (starts back out the door)
Giles,W-what should I do?
Buffy,"(faces Giles) Um, go outside and make sure the others are okay."
Giles,Buffy!
Owen,Somebody's gotta help Buffy!
Willow,Owen!
Andrew,They told me about you while I was sleeping.
Andrew,Uh! Why does he hurt me?
Owen,Buffy!
Owen,No!
Owen,Did you see that? He tried to bite me! (helps Buffy up) What a  sissy!
Buffy,No!
Andrew,Dead! (lets Owen fall) He was found wanting!
Buffy,You killed my date!
Willow,Buffy! Owen's...
Xander,(pulls Willow back) J-just give her a sec!
Buffy,You killed my date!
Andrew,Your turn!
Owen,Does anyone have an aspirin? Or sixty?
Buffy,(goes to Owen) Owen! (crouches beside him)
Owen,What happened to that guy?
Buffy,Oh... We scared him away.
Owen,"Oh, good. 'Cause, y'know, I would've..."
Buffy,I know. Here... (helps him up) I'm sure this isn't exactly what  you had in mind for our first date.
Owen,(rubs his head) Yeah! I was hoping maybe we'd finish at Ben &  Jerry's.
Buffy,We still could...
Owen,"No, I, I, I think I'll just walk home. (starts to go, but stops)  Uh, which way's home?"
Buffy,I'll get you there.
Owen,"No, I'll, I'll go it alone."
Xander,We'll make sure he gets home safely.
Giles,"Buffy, if I might, uh..."
Buffy,(cuts him off) Don't! (slowly walks out)
Buffy,"Well, did Owen say anything about me on the way home?"
Willow,"Oh, you mean specifically about you?"
Buffy,"Or generally... i-in the area, in the ballpark, any sort of  indication?"
Xander,"Well, in that case, no."
Willow,"But he was pretty incoherent, so we might've missed it."
Buffy,You think?
Xander,No.
Buffy,I knew it. I totally blew it last night!
Xander,"No, see, what you need is a guy who already knows your deepest,  darkest secrets and still says, 'Hey! I like that girl!' Someone like..."
Buffy,(sees Owen) Owen!
Willow,"Well, heh... This is our stop."
Owen,Hi.
Buffy,Hi. (long awkward pause) This is going well.
Owen,"I don't really know how to say this, but... about last night..."
Buffy,You don't even have to. I'm sure you were pretty freaked out.
Owen,Totally. (Buffy looks down) And... I was wondering when I could  see you again.
Buffy,"(looks back up) Um, that was my hopeful ear. Could you repeat  that?"
Owen,I think you're the coolest!
Buffy,(smiles) Really?
Owen,"I mean, last night was incredible! I never thought nearly getting  killed would make me feel so... alive!"
Buffy,(looks down and starts to walk) So that's why you wanna be with  me.
Owen,"(follows her) Oh, absolutely! When can we do something like that  again?"
Buffy,Something like...
Owen,"Like, walk downtown at three in the morning, a-and pick a fight  in a bar. How about tonight?"
Buffy,Tonight would... (they stop walking) be... not a workable thing.  Did I just say that?
Owen,"Tomorrow, then. I-I'm free any night this week."
Buffy,"I'm not. Please don't take this personally. It's not you, it's  me."
Owen,(begins to get it) Right. It's you.
Buffy,And I was kinda hoping that... maybe you and I could still be...
Owen,"(very disappointed) I, I get it. You just wanna be friends."
Buffy,That'd be nice.
Owen,Friends. Yeah. Great. (leaves)
Lyrics,<I>The world will keep on turning / It'll all be there come  morning / So tonight...</I>
Buffy,Yeah. Great.

Giles,"I was ten years old when my father told me I was destined to be  a Watcher. (sits next to her) He was one, and his, uh, mother before  him, and I was to be next."
Buffy,Were you thrilled beyond all measure?
Giles,"No, I had very definite plans about my future. I was going to be  a fighter pilot. Or possibly a grocer. Well, uh... My father gave me a  very tiresome speech about, uh, responsibility and sacrifice."
Buffy,"Sacrifice, huh?"
Giles,(looks toward Owen) Seems like a nice lad.
Buffy,"Yeah. But he wants to be danger man. You, Xander, Willow, you  guys... you guys know the score, you're careful. Two days in my world  and Owen really *would* get himself killed. Or I'd get him killed.  (faces Giles) Or someone else."
Giles,"I, I went to the funeral home of my own free will."
Buffy,And I should've been there.
Giles,Buffy...
Buffy,I blew it!
Giles,"I have volumes of lore, of prophecies, of predictions. But I  don't have an instruction manual. We feel our way as we go along. And, I  must say, as a Slayer, you're, you're doing... pretty well."
Buffy,(smiles) Well. At least I did stop that prophecy thing from  coming true.
Giles,"You did! Handily. No more Anointed One. And I would imagine the  Master, wherever he is, is having a fairly bad day himself."
Master,"(quotes scripture) 'And in this time will come the Anointed.  And the Slayer will not know him. She will not stop him, and he will  lead her into hell.' (kneels down next to Collin) Welcome, my friend."
