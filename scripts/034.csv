character,dialogue
Buffy,"Look, I didn't do anything."
Buffy,Xander...
Buffy,Wait! Just see if he's okay! Please!
Buffy,Please. You don't understand.
Buffy,But I didn't *do* anything.
Snyder,Why do I find that so very hard to believe?
Snyder,"Buffy Summers. If there's trouble, she's behind it."
Buffy,(angrily) You stupid little troll. You have *no* idea!
Snyder,Attitude problem. Serious.
Buffy,"(faces the officer) Look, I just wanna know if my friends are  okay."
Buffy,Xander! (hugs him tightly) Ohhh...
Buffy,"I was so worried, I didn't know if you were okay. The cops  were..."
Xander,"Yeah, I, I heard them chase you out. I was just coming out of  it. (holds up his arm in a cast) Souvenir."
Buffy,"Well, what about the others?"
Buffy,Are they okay?
Buffy,"Okay. That was about equal parts protecting me and copping a  feel, right? (smiles)"
Buffy,What is it?
Xander,"The doctor said it was head trauma. She can wake up at any  time, but, um... the longer it lasts, the... less likely it is."
Buffy,I never should've let her try to do that curse. Angel must've  known.
Buffy,Where are her parents?
Xander,With relatives in Phoenix. I gave them a call. They're...  they're getting on a plane back.
Buffy,Does Oz know?
Xander,"(realizes his omission) Oh, man. Um... I didn't even think.  Um... I'll call him."
Xander,Hey.
Cordelia,(whispers) Hey.
Cordelia,(sighs) How is she? (they separate and look at Willow) The  doctor told me that...
Xander,"Yeah. We're, uh... still waiting."
Buffy,You okay?
Cordelia,I ran. I think I made it through three counties before I  realized nobody was chasing me. Not too brave.
Buffy,It was the right thing to do.
Xander,Did Giles keep up with you?
Cordelia,I didn't see Giles.
Buffy,You mean he's not in the hospital?
Xander,No.
Giles,Mm... (stirs a bit and exhales) Ohhh... (lifts his head)
Angelus,"Hi, Rupert. I wasn't sure you were gonna wake up. You had me  worried. (hops to his feet)"
Giles,(standing up slowly) What do you want?
Angelus,"I wanna torture you. I used to love it, and it's been a *long*  time. I mean, the last time I tortured somebody, they didn't even *have*  chainsaws."
Angelus,"Oh, yeah. Acathla. He's an even harder guy to wake up than you  are. I mean, I performed the rituals, said all the right phrases...  blood on my hand. Got nothing. Big doughnut hole for my troubles. I  figure you know the ritual. You're pretty up on these things. You could  probably... tell me what I'm doing wrong. (approaches Giles) But  honestly, I sorta hope you don't... (stops in front of him) 'Cause I  *really* wanna torture you. (stares evilly)"
Joyce,No. I-i-it's impossible. There... there's been some terrible  mistake.
Joyce,She said she was going to her friend Willow's house. (shakes her  head) Maybe she slept over.
Joyce,Yes.
Joyce,(confused) What?
Joyce,Well...
Buffy,Giles! Giles!
Whistler,I don't think he's here.
Buffy,(pivots around to face him) Who are you?
Whistler,Whistler.
Buffy,What are you doing here?
Whistler,(reaches the base of the stairs) I'm waiting for you.
Buffy,Why?
Whistler,'Cause I-I-I need a date to the prom.
Buffy,"I have had a *really* bad day, okay? If you have information  worth hearing, then I am grateful for it. If you're gonna crack jokes,  then I'm gonna pull out your ribcage and wear it as a hat. (lets go)"
Whistler,"Hello to the imagery! Very nice. (seriously) It wasn't  supposed to go down like this. (moves away from the wall) Nobody saw you  coming. I figured this for Angel's big day. But I thought he was here to  *stop* Acathla, not to bring him forth. Then you two made with the  smoochies... now he's a creep again. Now, what are you gonna do? W-what  are you prepared to do?"
Buffy,Whatever I have to.
Whistler,"Maybe I should ask, what are you prepared to give up?"
Buffy,"(exhales) You don't have anything useful to tell me, do you?  What are you, just some immortal demon sent down to even the score  between good and evil?"
Whistler,(impressed) Wow. Good guess. (grins)
Buffy,"(steps up to him) Well, why don't you try getting off your  immortal ass and fighting evil once in a while? 'Cause I'm sick and  tired of doing it myself."
Whistler,"In the end, you're always by yourself. You're all you've got.  That's the point."
Buffy,(disgusted) Spare me. (starts to leave)
Whistler,The sword isn't enough. You gotta be ready. (raises his  voice) You gotta know how to use it!
Spike,"Hello, cutie. (smiles)"
Spike,"Now, you hold on a second!"
Spike,Hey! White flag here. I quit.
Buffy,Let me clear this up for you. We're mortal enemies. We don't get  time-outs.
Spike,"You want to go around, pet, I'll have a gay old time of it. You  want to stop Angel... we're gonna have to play this a bit differently."
Buffy,(still holding the stake) What are you talking about?
Spike,"I'm talking about your ex, pet. I'm talking about putting him in  the bloody ground."
Buffy,(chuckles) This has gotta be the *lamest* trick (lowers her  stake) you guys have ever thought up.
Spike,"He's got your Watcher. Right now, he's probably torturing him."
Buffy,What do you want?
Spike,I told you. I want to stop Angel. (snickers) I want to save the  world.
Buffy,"Okay. You do remember that you're a vampire, right?"
Spike,"We like to talk big. (indicates himself) Vampires do. 'I'm going  to destroy the world.' (looks at the officer) That's just tough guy  talk. (steps over to the car) Strutting around with your friends over a  pint of blood. (sits on the hood) The truth is, I like this world.  (pulls the cigarette pack from the officer's shirt pocket) You've got...  dog racing, Manchester United. (pulls one out and drops the pack on the  officer) And you've got people. (exhales) Billions of people walking  around like Happy Meals with legs. It's all right here. (lights the  cigarette and takes a drag) But then someone comes along with a vision.  With a real... (exhales) passion for destruction. (takes another drag  and looks at Buffy) Angel could pull it off. Goodbye, Picadilly.  Farewell, Leicester Bloody Square. You know what I'm saying?"
Buffy,"(nods) Okay, fine. You're not down with Angel. Why would you  ever come to me?"
Spike,"(stands and takes another drag, but doesn't look at her) I want  Dru back. I want it like it was before he came back. The way she acts  around him..."
Buffy,You're pathetic.
Buffy,I lost a friend tonight!
Spike,I wasn't in on that raiding party.
Buffy,"And I may lose more! The whole earth may be sucked into Hell,  and you want my help 'cause your girlfriend's a big ho? Well, let me  take this opportunity to *not* care."
Spike,"I can't fight them both alone, and neither can you!"
Buffy,I hate you.
Spike,And I'm all you've got.
Buffy,(looks down briefly) All right. Talk.
Spike,(turns to the officer) I'm just gonna kill this guy.
Spike,"Oh, right."
Buffy,(raises her eyebrows at him) Let's get inside.
Cordelia,Do you want some coffee?
Xander,"I don't wanna leave. She might, uh..."
Cordelia,I'll get it.
Xander,(looks up at her) Thanks.
Xander,"Come on, Will. Look, you don't have a choice here. You gotta  wake up. I need you, Will. I mean, how am I gonna pass trig, you know?  (chuckles) And who am I gonna call every night... and talk about  everything we did all day? You're my best friend. You've always..."
Xander,I love you.
Xander,Willow?
Willow,(whispers) Oz? (speaks) Oz?
Oz,I'm here.
Xander,(looks back at Oz) She's just starting to wake up.
Oz,"Hey, baby."
Willow,(weakly) Hi.
Xander,I'm gonna go get a doctor. (leaves)
Oz,How you feelin'?
Willow,"(weakly, eyes still closed) My head... feels big. Is it big?"
Oz,No. It's head size.
Willow,(whispers) Uh... is everybody else okay?
Angelus,"Rupert, buddy... I'm here to tell you, I'm impressed.  (chuckles)"
Angelus,Hey. Uh... (slides on the glasses) How you holdin' up?
Giles,(looks up at him weakly) Never... better.
Angelus,Glad to hear it. (kneels next to him) Now... (Giles breathes  painfully) Tell me when it hurts. (smirks)
Joyce,Buffy?!
Joyce,(stops the car) Where have you been? (gets out) Are you okay?  (runs over) The police were here! I've been looking for you!
Buffy,"Mom, let's, let's go inside, and I can explain."
Joyce,(hysterical) Who is this man? (to Spike) Who are you? (to Buffy)  Are you okay?
Buffy,Mom! I'm-I'm okay.
Joyce,"Buffy, terrible things have happened. What were you doing?"
Spike,"What, your mum doesn't know?"
Joyce,(to Spike) Know what?
Buffy,"(faces her mom) That I'm, uh... in a band. A-a rock band with  Spike here. (shoots Spike a look)"
Spike,"Right. She plays the, the triangle."
Buffy,Drums.
Spike,"Drums, yeah. She's, uh, hell on the old skins, you know."
Joyce,"(unconvinced) Hmm. And, uh, what do you do?"
Spike,"Well, I sing."
Buffy,"You know what? Why don't we go inside, and, and we can talk  about this. (nods)"
Joyce,"I'm, I'm not sure how I feel about this."
Spike,One of Angel's boys.
Buffy,"Yeah, probably watching me. Or you."
Spike,Yeah. He won't get a chance to tattle on us now.
Joyce,(utterly confused) Buffy... what... is going on?
Buffy,Mom... I'm a Vampire Slayer.
Willow,"I'm okay, Buffy, really. I mean, I don't feel good, but... I'm  awake, and I know my name and who's President and how many fingers, so  they don't think my brain got mushed at all."
Buffy,(cut to her in her kitchen) Thank God. So sorry I can't be  there.
Willow,I know. (cut to her) I'm sorry I didn't get to cure Angel.
Buffy,Don't be. It just (cut to her) wasn't meant to be. I know I'm  never gonna get him back the way he was. It just makes it easier.
Willow,(cut to her) I guess. Any luck finding Giles?
Buffy,(cut to her) Yep. I got a lucky break.
Willow,What?
Buffy,You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Buffy,Xander. Angel and the others are holed up outside town. You  remember that funky-looking mansion you showed me that time?
Xander,(into the phone) On Crawford Street. Sure. That makes sense.  What's the drill?
Buffy,(cut to her) I'm gonna hit it come daybreak.
Xander,(cut to him) You'll need backup.
Buffy,No. (cut to her) You stay there. I'm covered.
Xander,"(cut to him) Do you, um... do you think Giles is still alive?"
Buffy,(cut to her) I think he is. I just wish he was here to tell me  what to do.
Joyce,Have we met?
Spike,"(faces her) Um... you hit me with an ax one time. Remember?  (makes an ax-holding gesture) Uh, 'get the hell away from my daughter.'  (lowers his arms)"
Joyce,Oh.
Joyce,"So, do you, uh, live here in town?"
Joyce,I-is Willow all right?
Buffy,"Yeah. She's fine. (to Spike) All right, talk. What's the deal?"
Spike,"Simple. You let me and Dru skip town, I help you kill Angel."
Joyce,(confused) Angel? Your boyfriend?
Buffy,(to Spike) Forget about Drusilla. She doesn't walk.
Spike,There's no deal without Dru.
Buffy,She killed Kendra.
Spike,"(surprised) Dru bagged a Slayer? (chuckles) She didn't tell me!  (to Joyce, smiling) Hey, good for her! (gets a look from Buffy and loses  the smile) Though not from your perspective, I suppose."
Buffy,(with contempt) I can't believe I invited you into my house.
Joyce,(relieved) So you didn't kill that girl.
Buffy,Of course not.
Joyce,Did she explode like that man out there?
Buffy,"She was a Slayer, Mom."
Joyce,Like what you are.
Spike,Look. (pulls Buffy aside) This deal works for me one way. Full  stop. Me and Dru for Angel.
Joyce,"(still confused) Honey, a-are you sure you're a Vampire Slayer?"
Spike,"I'll take her out of the country. You'll never hear from us  again, I *bloody* well hope."
Buffy,(ignores her mother) Fine. Get back to the mansion. Make sure  Giles is all right.
Joyce,"I-I mean, have you tried *not* being a Slayer?"
Buffy,Mom!
Buffy,(to Spike) Be ready to back me up when I make my move.
Buffy,If Giles dies... (Spike stops and faces her) she dies.
Joyce,"(trying to make sense of it) It's because you didn't have a  strong father figure, isn't it?"
Buffy,"It's just fate, Mom. I'm the Slayer. Accept it."
Joyce,We should call the police. (heads for the kitchen)
Buffy,No. We're not calling the police.
Joyce,"(stops and faces her daughter, smiling) Well, now that we know  that you're innocent, it's..."
Buffy,"What? You thought I was guilty? Jeez, feelin' the love in *this*  room!"
Joyce,"No, I didn't think that. It's just... now we have proof."
Buffy,"(exasperated) We have my word, Mom. Not proof."
Joyce,"(heads for the kitchen again) Look, I am sure that they will  understand."
Buffy,"(follows closely) Get them involved, you'll get them killed."
Joyce,"Well, you're not gonna hurt them, are you?"
Buffy,"I'm a Slayer, not a postal worker."
Buffy,Cops can't fight demons. (takes the phone from her mom) I have  to do it. (puts the phone back in its cradle)
Joyce,"(demanding) Do what? Buffy, what is happening?"
Buffy,(doesn't want to deal) Just have another drink.
Joyce,Don't you talk to me that way! (Buffy stops in her tracks) You  don't get to just dump something like this on me and pretend it's  nothing!
Buffy,"(looks at her) I'm sorry, Mom, but I don't have time for this.  (starts for the door again, but stops)"
Joyce,"No! I am tired of 'I don't have time' or-or 'you wouldn't  understand.' (Buffy faces her) I am your mother, and you will *make*  time to explain yourself."
Buffy,I told you. I'm a Vampire Slayer.
Joyce,"(haughtily) Well, I just don't accept that!"
Buffy,"(steps closer) Open your eyes, Mom. What do you think has been  going on for the past two years? The fights, the weird occurrences. How  many times have you washed blood out of my clothing, and you still  haven't figured it out?"
Joyce,"(raises her voice angrily) Well, it stops now!"
Buffy,"(raises her voice also) No, it doesn't stop! It *never* stops!  Do-do you think I chose to be like this? Do you have any idea how lonely  it is, how dangerous? I would *love* to be upstairs watching TV or  gossiping about boys or... God, even studying! But I have to save the  world... again."
Joyce,"No. This is insane. (takes Buffy by the shoulders) Buffy, you  need help."
Buffy,(throws off her mom's arms) I'm *not* crazy! What I need is for  you to chill. I *have* to go!
Joyce,(shakes her head) No. I am not letting you out of this house.
Buffy,You can't stop me.
Joyce,(grabs her) Oh yes I...
Joyce,"(angrily) You walk out of this house, don't even *think* about  coming back!"
Cordelia,"(paces) So Buffy's going for the big showdown, huh? Wish we  could help. (to Xander) You know, without dying."
Xander,I don't see how.
Willow,I wanna try again.
Oz,Try what?
Willow,The curse. We never got to finish it. Maybe we *can* restore  Angel's soul.
Xander,"I don't like it. You're talking about messing with powerful  magic, and you're weak."
Willow,I'm okay.
Xander,You don't look okay. (to Cordelia) Does she?
Cordelia,"You should listen to him. The hair, it's so flat, and the  lips..."
Xander,"(to Cordelia) Could we stay on topic here, honey?"
Cordelia,What?
Xander,"(to Willow) Look, it's not a good idea."
Willow,"There's no use arguing with me. Do you see my resolve face?  (gives them her resolve face) You've seen it before. You know what it  means. This can help Buffy. If we turn Angel back soon enough, we can  stop him from ever awakening Acathla."
Oz,"(gets up) Okay, I pretty much missed out on some stuff, didn't I?  Because this is all making a kind of sense that's... not."
Willow,(to Oz) Go with Cordy to the library and get my things. She'll  fill you in.
Oz,Sure. (kisses her hand) I'll drive.
Willow,"Xander, go to Buffy. Tell her what we're doing. Maybe she can  stall."
Xander,But I...
Willow,(points to herself) Resolve face.
Xander,(gives in) Be careful. (leaves)
Angelus,"You know, I can stop the pain. You've been very brave... (puts  his hand on Giles' shoulder) but it's over. (walks behind him) You've  given enough. (leans down to Giles' ear) Now let me make it stop."
Giles,(panting and shaking with pain) Please!
Angelus,(kneels to face him) Just tell me what I need to know.
Giles,(weakly) In order... to be worthy...
Angelus,(whispers) Yeah?
Giles,(weakly) You must perform the ritual... in a tutu.
Giles,Pillock!
Angelus,(stands up) All right. Someone get the chainsaw.
Spike,"(wheels himself in) Now, now, don't let's lose our temper."
Angelus,"Keep out of it, sit 'n' spin."
Spike,"Look, you cut him up, you'll never get your answers."
Angelus,Since when did *you* become so levelheaded?
Spike,"Right about the time you became so pig-headed. You have your way  with him, you'll never get to destroy the world. And I don't fancy  spending the next month trying to get librarian out of the carpet. There  are other ways."
Angelus,Enlighten me.
Spike,Hmm. (behind himself) Drusilla? Sweetheart?
Spike,Do you want to play a game?
Snyder,"You do know this is a crime scene, don't you? (Buffy looks up  at him approaching) But then... you're a criminal, so that pretty much  works out. (stops)"
Buffy,You know I didn't do it. The police will figure it out.
Snyder,"In case you haven't noticed, the police of Sunnydale are  *deeply* stupid. (takes a few steps closer) It doesn't matter anyway.  Whatever they find, you've proved too much of a liability for this  school. (takes a breath) These are the moments you want to savor. You  wish time would stop so that you could live them over and over again.  (smiles smugly) You're expelled."
Buffy,"You never ever got a single date in high school, (turns her eyes  to him) did you?"
Snyder,Your point being?
Snyder,It's Snyder. (smiles) Tell the Mayor I have good news.
Drusilla,Is that better? (pats more) Hmm? (pulls away the cloth) Poor  thing. (runs her finger down his cheek) Let's see what's inside.
Drusilla,(into Giles' ear) Of course.
Drusilla,Look at me.
Drusilla,Mm-mm-mm-mm.
Drusilla,Be... in me.
Drusilla,Hmm. See with your heart.
Giles,(smiles) Jenny! I thought I'd lost you.
Giles,(tries to get up) We have to get out of here.
Giles,It can't be you. (stares into her eyes)
Giles,(breathing erratically) No. (desperately) We have to get... him  away from Acathla.
Giles,"(nods, anxious to go) Later."
Giles,(desperately) We have to get Angel away from Acathla.
Giles,"(weakly) H-h-his, his blood... H-he mustn't..."
Angelus,Blood. Of course. The blood on my hands must be my own. I am  the key that will open up the door. My blood. My life. (considers) Okay.  Kill him. (turns to go)
Spike,"Uh, but what if he's lying?"
Angelus,"Yeah. Good point. Alright, don't kill him. (leans down to  Spike) You know, I kinda like having you watch my back. It's kinda like  old times. (chuckles)"
Spike,"Uh, Drusilla..."
Angelus,Honey...
Spike,"We are finished here, ducks."
Drusilla,Sorry. (smiles evilly) I was in the moment.
Buffy,"Whistler. What did you mean, the sword isn't enough?"
Whistler,"(finds a bottle of beer) You know, raiding an Englishman's  fridge is like dating a nun. You're never gonna get the good stuff."
Buffy,Tell me how to use it.
Whistler,"(takes a swig and looks back at Buffy) Angel's the key.  (closes the fridge) His blood will open the door to Hell. Acathla opens  his big mouth, creates a vortex. Then only Angel's blood will close it.  One blow will send 'em both back to Hell. But I strongly suggest that  you get there before that happens, 'cause the faster you kill Angel, the  easier it's gonna be on you."
Buffy,Don't worry about me.
Whistler,"It's all on the line here, kid."
Buffy,I can deal. (sadly) I got nothing left to lose. (leaves)
Whistler,"Wrong, kid. You got one more thing."
Buffy,Xander!
Xander,"Cavalry's here. Cavalry's a frightened guy with a rock, (holds  up a large rock) but it's here."
Xander,That's better.
Buffy,"You're not here to fight. (starts walking) You get Giles out,  and you run like hell, understood? I can't protect you. (pulls off and  discards the cloth) I'm gonna be too busy killing."
Xander,"(looks at the sword) Now, that's a new look for you."
Buffy,It's a present for Angel.
Xander,"Willow. (stops) Uh, she told me to tell you..."
Buffy,Tell me what?
Xander,(pauses to think) Kick his ass.
Angelus,Acathla... Mundatus sum... pro te necavi. Sanguinem meum...  pro te effundam... (steps slowly toward Acathla) quo me dignum... esse  demonstrem.
Translation,Acathla... I am cleansed... here before you. My blood...  flowing before you... (steps slowly toward Acathla) makes me worthy...  as I demonstrate.
Willow,Are we ready?
Cordelia,Stinky herbs are a go.
Oz,Did I mention I didn't take Latin?
Willow,Y-you don't have to understand it. You just have to say it. I  hope.
Oz,Right.
Angelus,"Now, Acathla..."
Angelus,You will be free.
Angelus,And so will we all.
Buffy,"Hello, lover."
Angelus,(bored) I don't have time for you.
Buffy,You don't have a lot of time *left*.
Angelus,"Coming on kind of strong, don't you think? You're playing some  deep odds here. Do you really think you can take us all on?"
Buffy,No. I don't.
Spike,"Painful, isn't it?"
Spike,"I don't want to hurt you, baby."
Spike,Doesn't mean I won't.
Oz,"Quod perditum est, invenietur."
Translation,"What is lost, return."
Willow,"Not dead... nor not of the living. Spirits of the interregnum,  I call."
Xander,Giles!
Xander,Giles!
Giles,Xander?
Xander,Can you walk?
Giles,You're not real.
Xander,"Sure, I'm real."
Giles,"It's a trick. They get inside my head, make me see things I  want."
Xander,Then why would they make you see me?
Giles,(considers) You're right. Let's go.
Xander,Come on.
Drusilla,Oh... Here he comes.
Willow,"Gods, bind him. Cast his heart from the... evil... realm."
Angelus,"You almost made it, Buff."
Buffy,It's not over yet.
Angelus,My boy Acathla here is about to wake up. You're going to Hell.
Buffy,Save me a seat.
Willow,Return. (pants) I call on... (pants)
Oz,(worried) Willow?
Cordelia,(worried) Are you okay?
Willow,"Te implor, Doamne, nu ignora aceasta rugaminte."
Translation,"I implore you, Lord, do not ignore this request."
Oz,(to Cordelia) Is this a good thing?
Willow,"Nici mort, nici al fiintei..."
Translation,"Neither dead, nor of the living..."
Cordelia,"(freaked out) Hey, speak English!"
Willow,"Lasa orbita sa fie vasul care-i va transporta, sufletul la el."
Translation,Let this Orb be the vessel that will carry his soul to  him.
Spike,"Sorry, baby. Wish there was another way."
Spike,"God, he's gonna kill her."
Angelus,"Now that's everything, huh? No weapons... No friends... No  hope."
Angelus,Take all that away... and what's left?
Buffy,Me.
Willow,Asa sa fie! Asa sa fie! Acum!
Translation,So it shall be! So it shall be! Now!
Willow,Acum!
Translation,Now!
Angel,(softly) Buffy? (sobs) What's going on?
Angel,Where are we? I-I don't remember.
Buffy,(softly) Angel?
Angel,(sees her wound) You're hurt.
Angel,"Oh, Buffy... God."
Angel,I... I feel like I haven't seen you in months.
Angel,"Oh, my God, everything's so muddled. I..."
Angel,Oh...
Angel,"Oh, Buffy..."
Angel,(confused) What's happening?
Buffy,(whispers reassuringly) Shh. Don't worry about it.
Buffy,(whispers) I love you.
Angel,(whispers) I love you.
Buffy,Close your eyes.
Angel,Buffy...

Giles,"Willow, are you sure you should be out of bed?"
Willow,Look who's talking.
Giles,(smiles) Yes.
Cordelia,Any word?
Xander,You guys haven't seen her either?
Willow,No.
Oz,"But we know the world didn't end, 'cause... (looks around) check it  out."
Giles,"(takes off his glasses and squints) Well, we, uh... we went back  to the mansion. I-it was empty, um... and Acathla was, was... dormant."
Willow,I think the spell worked. I felt something go through me.
Cordelia,Plus the Orb did that cool glow thing.
Xander,"Well, maybe it wasn't in time. Maybe she had to kill him before  the cure could work."
Oz,"Well, then, she'd wanna be alone, I guess."
Willow,"Or maybe Angel *was* saved, and they want to be alone together."
Giles,Perhaps.
Cordelia,"Well, she's gotta show up sooner or later. We still have  school."
Willow,Yeah. (looks around for her) She'll be here in a while.
