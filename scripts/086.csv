GLORY,You keep refusing to tell me where the key is!
MONK,We had to hide the key ... made it human and sent it to you.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,Dawn.
DAWN,What's wrong with Mom?
GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
BUFFY,I don't know.
RILEY,"Buffy's like nobody else in the world. When I'm with her it's like, half of me is just ... on fire, going crazy if I'm not touching her. But she doesn't love me."
RILEY,"I know you got a lot on your mind. You decide you wanna let me in on any of it, you let me know."
SANDY,We ... could go somewhere else. Someplace more ... private.
RILEY,"Ohhhh, Sandy, Sandy. My heart belongs to another. Besides, I don't go out with vampires."
BUFFY,Spike. I want you.
SPIKE,"God, I love you so much."
SPIKE,"Oh god, no. Please no."
BUFFY,Are you okay?
JOYCE,You know the nothing that I've been dealing with the last couple of weeks? I-it might not be nothing.
BUFFY,What is it?
JOYCE,"I'm, uh, staying overnight at the hospital for observation. I'm getting a CAT scan."
DAWN,What is a CAT scan exactly?
BUFFY,"I don't know. It's some ... x-ray, I guess."
DAWN,"Where do they get the CAT scan from? I mean, do they test it on cats or ... or does the machine sort of look like a cat?"
BUFFY,"Dawn, I'm really..."
TARA VOICEOVER,"""Your one-stop spot to shop for all your occult needs."""
TARA,Catchy.
GILES,Think so?
TARA,"Uh-huh. In a ... hard to read sort of way, but I think it's great."
GILES,Oh.
XANDER,"I'm just saying, I think it's rude."
WILLOW,I wouldn't call it rude.
XANDER,"Rude-ish. Rude-esque. Whatever you want to call it. When a person makes a ""destroy all vampires"" date, it's simple courtesy to wait for your co-destroyers. Am I right, Giles?"
GILES,"I'm almost certain you're not, but to be fair, I wasn't listening."
TARA,"Oh, the-the new phone book's in with Mr. Giles' ad."
WILLOW,"Oh, nice."
ANYA,Yay! Am I mentioned? (looking eagerly at the ad)
GILES,Not as such.
ANYA,(disappointed) Oh.
XANDER,"Okay, we were supposed to hook up with Riley this morning, to take on a nest o'vamps holed up in a tomb? So we get there, and guess what? Tell him, Will."
WILLOW,Tomb go boom.
XANDER,Yep. Captain America blowed it up real good. All by his lone wolf lonesome.
GILES,"Hmm, uh, rather reckless of him. (We see Anya still studying the ad.)"
XANDER,I'd say very rather.
GILES,"All that aside, I should think you'd be pleased to avoid the confrontation."
ANYA,"That's what I've been saying. I mean, I for one didn't want to start my day with a slaughter. (Suddenly gets a look of realization on her face; excitedly) Which really just goes to show how much I've grown! (Smiles hugely. Willow and Tara grin at each other)"
GILES,"Yes, well, um, in any event, uh, since you're all here, Tara and I could use your help researching Buffy's mysterious woman."
XANDER,"Oh yeah, this has been fruitful. Trying to look up something you ... never saw and don't know the name of."
ANYA: Just do what I do,flip through the pages and look busy.
WILLOW,"It'd be nice if we knew where she was, where she's hiding out."
XANDER,"No doubt lurking around some sewer or condemned church or rat-infested warehouse. You know, the usual haunts."
Cut to,"a beautiful, well-appointed apartment. Glory reclines on a round bed surrounded by shoeboxes. A demon dressed in monk's clothing is kneeling on the floor, holding a scroll."
DREG,"Most beauteous and supremely magnificent one, this dark spell I hold in my worthless and scabby hand is our gift to you, most tingly and wonderful Glorificus..."
GLORY,"(trying on a shoe) Please, call me Glory. And get up, looking at you is hurting my neck."
DREG,"(gets up) Forgive me, shiny special one. I beg of you to rip out my inadequate tongue."
GLORY,(reaches out her hand) Gimme.
DREG,"Oh. (laughs nervously) I thought... (still laughing as Glory examines the paper) You should know, your elaborate marvelousness, that this dark incantation has been lost for eons..."
GLORY,Uh-huh. (trying on another shoe)
DREG,And great dangers have been faced to...
GLORY,(sticking her leg straight up in the air) Does this pump make my ankle look bony?
DREG,"No! No, no, your terrifically smooth one, it is the epitome of ankles. (Glory ignores him, trying on another shoe) To touch such an ankle would be - but I'm not touching. I'm backing away."
DREG,Ow! Thank you.
GLORY,"Dreg, is it? (Gets up)"
DREG,Yes. Dreg. Your creamy coolness has honored me by speaking my name. Your voice is like a thousand sweet songbirds that-
GLORY,"(irritated) Yeah, I never tire of hearing that. Look, just so we're clear, the spell's gonna work, right? (Dreg nods anxiously. Glory turns and goes to the window, peeking around the curtain) I mean, nothing worse than a gift that doesn't work. Then I'd have to get all mad and kill you! (apologetically) It's this whole big thing."
DREG,"It will work, your extremeness. Provided you have the other items you need."
GLORY,Don't worry. I'll have them all right.
GLORY,I'll have it all.
RILEY,(calling) Hello? Buffy?
Cut to,"Spike holding a pink sweater up to his face and inhaling deeply. He lowers the sweater, sighing happily, then takes another sniff as Riley appears behind him."
RILEY,What are you doing in here?
SPIKE,"What, me? I was um ... uh ... what are *you* doing here?"
RILEY,Looking for the girl who's gonna rip your arms off when she finds out you were in her bedroom. (Walks forward.)
SPIKE,Oh yeah? Well ... me too.
RILEY,(bemused) Were you ... were you just smelling her sweater?
SPIKE,"(scoffs) No. (Riley glares at him) Well, yeah, all right, I did. It's a ... predator thing, nothin' wrong with it. Just ... know your enemy's scent, whet the appetite for a hunt. (He sniffs the sweater again) Ah, that's the stuff! Slayer musk, it's bitter and aggravating!"
RILEY,Out.
SPIKE,"Hey, watch it! Easy, you're bruising the leather! (They reach the bottom of the stairs and Riley lets go) Look. I know for a bleeding fact the Slayer wouldn't mind me being here."
RILEY,Right. What's a little sweater-sniffing between sworn enemies.
SPIKE,"Your girl in the habit of buying her enemies drinks? 'Cause she spent the better part of last night with me, (smugly) doing just that."
RILEY,'Cause you guys are such tight pals.
SPIKE,Yeah.
RILEY,That's good. Tell me another.
SPIKE,"Okay, how 'bout this one. Twice in recent memory, she's had the lover-wiccas do a deinvite on the house. Keep out specific vamps. Ever ask yourself why she's never taken my name off the guest list?"
RILEY,(falters for a moment) Because you're harmless.
SPIKE,"Oh yeah, right. (scoffs) Takes one to know, I suppose. Least I still got the attitude. (looking Riley up and down) What do you got, a piercing glance? Face it, white bread. Buffy's got a type, and you're not it. She likes us dangerous, rough, occasionally bumpy in the forehead region. (patronizingly) Not that she doesn't like you ... but sorry Charlie, you're just not dark enough."
SPIKE,Hey ... Hey! Hey! Hey!
RILEY,Am I dark enough for you now?
SPIKE,"Bloody pull me back in, you sod, I'm starting to sizzle!"
RILEY,"You don't know anything about Buffy, you never did. I'm the one who knows what she needs."
SPIKE,"Oh yeah? That's why you're with her at hospital right now, giving her what she needs."
RILEY,(pulls Spike back inside) What are you talking about?
SPIKE,"Don't you know, didn't she tell you?"
RILEY,You tell me.
SPIKE,"Mum's sickly. Buffy took her to the hospital for a bit of prod 'n probe. Bite-sized one went too. (needling) You know, it's-it's funny her not calling you about that. I've known since last night."
SPIKE,(OS) Blanket! Blanket!
BUFFY,(sighs) Riley.
RILEY,Sorry. I heard. I thought maybe you'd ... need ....
BUFFY,"I do. I do. I'm glad. (pulls back) I just, I-I didn't ... I mean, until we knew what it was..."
RILEY,I understand. How's she doing?
BUFFY,"Well, she just had a CAT scan. I was about to go in and find out. Will you ... sit with Dawn while I talk to Mom? She's in the waiting room."
RILEY,"Yeah, yeah, you got it."
BUFFY,Hi.
BUFFY,May I come in?
JOYCE,"Oh, of course, baby, come on in. Uh, where's Dawn?"
BUFFY,"Uh, she's with Riley. They're watching TV in the waiting room."
DR. ISAACS,"Excuse me, I'm just gonna check on the status of the OR. (Exits)"
BUFFY,The OR?
JOYCE,"Dr Isaacs says I'm ... lucky there's one available on such short notice. Some people wait for days, sometimes, weeks."
BUFFY,"(softly) Mom, what did they find?"
JOYCE,"A shadow. I've got a shadow. (looks at the images on the wall) Somewhere ... over there ... he showed it to me, but, um ... they have to do a biopsy to find out exactly what it is."
JOYCE,(voice breaking) Doctor says it's too early to be concerned.
BUFFY,Right. (pulls back to look Joyce in the face) No concern.
JOYCE,Just a shadow.
WILLOW VOICEOVER,I just wish we knew what we were dealing with.
WILLOW,It feels like we're going around in circles.
XANDER,"Our circles are going around in circles. We've got dizzy circles here, Giles."
GILES,"Ah, weeping buddha, shoulders your spiritual burden. (wraps the item) Makes a lovely paperweight too."
TARA,Maybe she's not in the books.
WILLOW,What do you mean?
TARA,"I mean, what if she's not a demon or sorceress or spirit or whatever these books cover? (Giles looks over at her as he rings up the sale) What if she's something else altogether?"
GILES,"Thank you, come again. (Hands item to customer and comes out from behind counter toward the table) Something new, you mean?"
TARA,(shakes head) Something old. So old it pre-dates the written word.
WILLOW,"(thinks of something) Giles, the Dagon sphere. You said that was created to repel..."
GILES,That which cannot be named. (removes glasses thoughtfully)
WILLOW,So I'm thinking maybe she...
GILES,Predates language itself?
XANDER,"Well hey, if it means I don't have to read any more, woo! And might I add a big hoo!"
GILES,"If Tara's right, then we're blind. There's ... there's no way we can determine ... her moves, her habits, where she'll turn up next-"
GILES,Oh! I beg your-
GLORY,(abruptly) Uh-huh. (holds up items) I want these.
GILES,"Yes, of course! (hurries behind the counter, taking the items) Um, you find everything all right?"
GLORY,No problemo. (takes out her purse as Giles scribbles on a receipt)
GILES,"That's, um..."
GILES,"Your receipt. (Hands receipt to an impatient Glory) And ... (puts items in a paper bag) Thank you! (hands bag to Glory. She smiles and leaves. Giles watches her, smiling.)"
GILES,"(turns back to the others, removes glasses again) She could be anywhere. But if she is as powerful as, uh, Buffy says, I imagine it won't be long before she makes herself known."
DR. ISAACS,"Everything went fine, they're moving her into recovery now."
BUFFY,(nervous) Do we have the results yet?
DR. ISAACS,"Let's, um, sit down over here for a minute."
BUFFY,"No! (more quietly) Excuse me, no, I ... I don't mean to be rude, I just, I've been sitting for hours, I don't wanna sit. I just ... tell me, please."
DR. ISAACS,"Your mother has ... the term is low-grade glioma. It's a brain tumor. The clinical name is oligodendroglioma. It's in the left hemisphere of the cerebrum. In your mother's case the tumor seems to have started there. In other words, it hasn't spread from another part of the body..."
DR. ISAACS,"I know this is very difficult, and, uh, because of the nature of your mother's illness ... unfortunately, things may progress very quickly."
BUFFY,Things? What things?
DR. ISAACS,"Symptoms. There's a fair variety that might present. Loss of vision or appetite, lack of muscle control, uh, mood swings..."
BUFFY,But what can we do?
DR. ISAACS,"Well, not much, until we determine if the tumor's operable. Which we are working on. (Leads Buffy over to some chairs and they sit)"
BUFFY,Is there something that I ... I mean ... can I help?
DR. ISAACS,"Well, there's some literature you might want to look at. If we aren't able to go in surgically, there are a number of new treatments that are very promising. Your mother's prognosis is a lot better today than it would have been only a year ago. Even if the tumor's not operable, she has a real chance."
BUFFY,What's a real chance?
DR. ISAACS,"Nearly one out of three patients with this condition does just fine. (Buffy sits back looking shocked. Camera stays on her face as the doctor continues.) Now, let me ask. Does your mother's insurance company require copies of the MRI and pathology reports?"
BUFFY,I'm not sure.
DR. ISAACS,"(OS) Well, just let me know as soon as possible. And I could use some information regarding your mom's lifestyle and home environment. For instance, does she use a cell phone?"
BUFFY,"(frowns) Uh, I think so. Uh, yeah, she um, she-she has one of those ear things."
DR. ISAACS,"OK, is your house near any power lines, chemical plants, waste disposal facilities?"
BUFFY,Uh ... I-I don't know. Maybe.
DR. ISAACS,"Well, the more we know..."
BUFFY,I'm sorry.
BEN,"Excuse me Doc, but they told me you're needed in ICU."
DR. ISAACS,"Excuse me, Miss Summers. (Gets up)"
BUFFY,"(distracted) Uh, it's okay."
BEN,"Thought you looked like you needed a break. Guy's great, but he doesn't have the bone in his head that tells him when to back off."
BUFFY,"You mean ... they, they didn't need him?"
BEN,"Well, I'm sure someone does somewhere, they always do. He really is a good doctor. Your mom's in good hands."
BUFFY,"(smiles) Thank you. It's Ben, right?"
BEN,Right.
BUFFY,"He, um, he was just telling me that there's nothing I can do."
BEN,"Yeah, I'm gonna tell you the same thing. Give yourself a break. Listen, your mom's gonna be unconscious for at least another six, seven hours."
BUFFY,A break?
BEN,"Well, I just mean go out, get some air. Come back later on this evening, talk to the doc then if you want. My unsolicited advice of the day."
RILEY,(OS) Buffy.
BUFFY,It's bad.
RILEY,I know.
BUFFY,I ... (grabs her coat and puts it on) I have to do something.
RILEY,Do something?
BUFFY,"Yeah, like, you know, magic, like a healing spell."
RILEY,Buffy ... people get sick. I don't think magic-
BUFFY,That attitude's not helping. (Riley looks cowed) I have to try.
RILEY,Okay.
BUFFY,"I need to talk to Giles. Uh, will you do me a favor and, and drop Dawn off at school, and tell her I'll meet her at the magic shop in an hour when she gets off?"
RILEY,"Of course, whatever you need me to do. (Buffy starts to leave) Buffy! (she stops) What do you want me to tell Dawn ... about your mom?"
BUFFY,Tell her we don't know anything yet.
ANYA,Hey. (louder) Hey! (shouting) HEY!
ANYA,HEY!!
GILES,"Anya, your heys are startling the customers."
XANDER,And-and pretty much the state.
ANYA,You sold someone a Khul's amulet and a Sobekian bloodstone.
GILES,"Yes, I believe I did. (takes receipt and examines it)"
ANYA,Are you stupid or something?
GILES,Allow me to answer that question with a firing.
XANDER,"She's kidding! (to Anya) An, we talked about the employee-employer vocabulary no-nos. That was number five."
ANYA,"(grabs receipt back from Giles) You never sell these things together, ever! Bad news! Don't you know about the Sobekites?"
WILLOW,"Oh! I do. It was an ancient Egyptian cult, heavy into dark magic. (Anya nods)"
TARA,"And the Khul's amulet, wasn't that a transmogrification conduit?"
ANYA,Damn straight!
GILES,"Be that as it may, I still see no reason for concern. I mean, the-the Sobekian transmogrification spells were lost thousands of years ago. And besides, the young woman to whom I sold them would have to have had enormous power- (Stops suddenly.)"
WILLOW,(quietly) Young woman?
GILES,"Oh, dear lord."
XANDER,What?
RILEY,You're melting.
DAWN,"Oh, um ... guess I'm not hungry."
RILEY,Maybe I'm not making this any better.
DAWN,"No, I just ... this is better. (They smile nervously at each other and are quiet for a moment.) I had my tenth birthday party here."
RILEY,Really?
DAWN,"Mm-hmm. We'd just moved to Sunnydale, and ... Mom rented the carousel for an entire hour for just me and my friends. (pauses) Except I hadn't made any friends yet, so ... it was just me and Mom and Buffy riding it by ourselves, over and over and over again... (Riley smiles) for the whole hour, just so Mom felt like we'd gotten our money's worth. (Pause, then Dawn speaks with her voice breaking) She's ... she's not gonna get better, is she?"
RILEY,(leans toward her) Absolutely she will. Summers women are tough.
DAWN,I'm really glad you're here.
RILEY,Thanks.
DAWN,Buffy's glad too.
RILEY,(smiles skeptically) Yeah?
DAWN,She sure cries a lot less with you than she did with Angel.
RILEY,"(surprised) Angel ... made her cry a lot, huh?"
DAWN,"Everything with him was all ... (grimaces, makes claw motions with hands) eee, you know?"
RILEY,All...?
DAWN,"You know ... ""my boyfriend's a vampire"" crazy crazy. (Riley nods) Every day was like the end of the world. She doesn't get all worked up like that over you."
DAWN,I think you've been really good for her.
BUFFY,"So I figured there has to be some kind of mystical cure, right? I mean, like a, a potion, or a spell or something. We have to look."
WILLOW,"We can look ... I mean, we will, but ... I haven't seen anything."
GILES,"The truth is, uh, the ... mystical and the medical aren't meant to mix, Buffy. Sorry, um .. .the human mind is very delicate. Too much can go wrong."
TARA,"Yeah, I've heard stories about people trying healing spells ... if we did something, it could make things a lot worse, Buffy."
ANYA,"We've done just about enough making things worse for one day, haven't we?"
BUFFY,Why? What do you mean?
XANDER,"Uh, nothing. Anya broke a ... bippity boppity boo. A thing. Don't worry about it."
ANYA,I did not! I didn't break-
GILES,"Anya, Buffy doesn't need to hear about your ... clumsiness right now."
ANYA,"(sighs) My clumsiness. I mean, that is so- (Willow and Xander give her meaningful looks. She looks at Buffy) ...like ... me. Slippery, slippery ... butterfingers."
BUFFY,(not fooled) What happened?
GILES,"Nothing to concern you, uh-"
BUFFY,Giles!
GILES,"(sighs) The, uh, (embarrassed) demon woman was here, the one who attacked you."
WILLOW,"It's no biggie, she-she just got an amulet and a bloodstone."
ANYA,That can create a monster.
WILLOW,"Okay, biggie."
BUFFY,"My god, are you guys okay though? I mean, did - no one got hurt, right?"
GILES,"Oh no, thankfully, no, uh, no violence to speak of."
BUFFY,"Okay, so, that's good ... (not understanding why everyone looks guilty) How did she get away with this bad mojo stuff?"
ANYA,(whispering) Giles sold it to her. (Buffy looks at Giles accusingly)
GILES,"(defensive) I, I, I... I didn't know it was her! I mean, how could I? (sighs) If it's any consolation, I may have overcharged her."
TARA,Anya figured out what the demon lady's up to.
ANYA,"Yeah, a few thousand years ago there was this cult, the temple of Sobek."
BUFFY,Sobek.
ANYA,Reptile demon. Sobekites were reptile worshippers.
XANDER,Just once I would like to run into a cult of bunny worshippers.
ANYA,(angrily) Great. Thank you very much for those nightmares.
XANDER,Sorry.
ANYA,"Anyway, their high priest Khul had great mystic powers. He, um, forged an amulet with transmogrifying crystal."
WILLOW,Transmogrifying is changing a living thing into a different kind of thing.
GILES,"We've managed to decipher the markings that were on the bloodstone that I sold - that she left with. Um, cobra. She's going to transmogrify a cobra."
BUFFY,"Okay, so she's making a monster. What for? What does it do?"
GILES,That's the part ... (clears throat) we're working on it.
BUFFY,"Well, you keep working on it I'll go kill it. (gets up to leave)"
GILES,Buffy?
BUFFY,(turns back) What? I'm going.
XANDER,"Buffy, this chick creamed you last time."
BUFFY,That's because I wasn't ready for her last time. I am now.
WILLOW,But you-
BUFFY,"But what? Will, I can't just sit here. I have to do something."
Cut to,"exterior shot of the Sunnydale Zoo, day."
Cut to,"inside the reptile building. Pan across a sign explaining the characteristics of the cobra. We see a cobra case with the snake inside. Pan back across to Glory looking at the case. She punches a fist through the glass, reaches in and grabs the snake. She holds it up to her face, smiling. The snake hisses. Glory hisses back(?). The snake's tail lashes angrily."
GLORY,"Chill, worm. I'm gonna make you a star! (Laughs. We see Dreg watching, smiling.)"
GLORY,Chant!
DREG,"The form is vessel, rendered new. The base is stone, bathed in blood. The gem is fire and elements rarified..."
GLORY,"(speaks English) Sobek, grant the power ... (Dreg continues chanting) that it may mold this wretched creature ... that it may be reborn ... that it may serve ... (irritated) ah! Dark incantations! Always overwritten! (Dreg stops chanting, looks uncertainly at her) Why can't they just cut to the-"
BUFFY,Fight?
GLORY,"No fair- (Buffy kicks her again) attacking- (Buffy punches her in the stomach, then in the face) when I wasn't even looking! (Buffy grabs her head and begins slamming it against the wall) Ow! (She grabs Buffy's hand, removes it from her head, and slams Buffy into the wall.) No, this is no good. (Buffy rises and tries to punch her again; Glory grabs Buffy's arm and pulls it behind her) I'm out of the moment... (braces her other hand against Buffy's shoulder) and you're not giving me anything I can use. Dreg! I'm not hearing chanting! (Punches Buffy in the face, then slams her against the wall)"
DREG,"(OS) Yes, Glory. (resumes chanting)"
GLORY,"Hey, hey. Work with me here. (Flings Buffy backward against another wall. She slides down to sit on the floor.) There! (grabs Buffy's hair and knees her in the face) That feels more real, don't you think? (Pulls Buffy up and flings her against another wall. Buffy lands upside down and stares, gasping, as Glory approaches. She grabs Buffy by the throat and lifts her up again."
GLORY,Even if I do have to carry your performance.
GLORY,(throws up her arms) Scene!
DREG,Cir hayyan win-hud!
GLORY,(walking toward the vase) Arise. (louder) Arise.
DREG,Cir hayyan win-hud!
GLORY,(annoyed) Arise!
DREG,He is arisen!
GLORY,'Bout damn time! (Smiles. Blackout.)
GLORY,Spawn of Sobek!
GLORY,"The power is yours ... (We see Buffy leaving) to see what is unseen. To find what is shrouded in shadow. Already, you know what I seek. I have given you form, now find for me the key. Seek it out in the holy places. (The creature hisses) Yes, yes, yes! Let your vision guide you to its hiding place, and then return to me and tell me where it lies."
GLORY,Now would be good.
GLORY,"(giggles) Fun, fun, fun!"
GILES,"<I>Aleister Crowley Sings</I>? Um, sadly, no, I-I don't carry that, but I do have some very nice whale sounds. (Sees Riley entering) Oh, excuse me for a moment."
RILEY,Where's Buffy?
GILES,"Um, she-she left a while ago."
RILEY,What? (sighs) Where?
XANDER,That creepy demon woman's conjuring some kind of monster.
RILEY,And you let Buffy go after her? Alone?
GILES,"Uh, ""let"" isn't really a factor when she sets her mind to something, you know that. (He sees a customer approaching the counter and hurries off.)"
RILEY,(to Xander) She'll get herself killed. It's crazy.
XANDER,"Yeah. Crazy. Going off alone, half-cocked, instead of waiting for much-needed backup ... charging in with a big old hand grenade ... oh, wait."
RILEY,This is different.
XANDER,"Yeah, it is. Buffy needs something she can fight, something she can solve. I don't know what kind of action you're looking for ... (looks closer at Riley) Do you?"
XANDER,"Hey, I'm not trying to get-"
RILEY,It's cool.
XANDER,You okay?
RILEY,(nods) Just a little crazed.
XANDER,I hear ya.
RILEY,"(moving toward the door) If, uh, she needs me... (He shrugs and leaves.)"
Cut to,exterior shot of a church.
Cut to,"interior of church. Pan across a statue of Jesus on the cross. Pan down. We see the snake creature moving through the church, hissing. Its eyes are yellow."
GILES,"Magic Box, your one-stop spot to shop for-"
BUFFY,"(on phone) Giles, it's me."
GILES,Buffy! You all right?
BUFFY,"No, I'm really not. (takes an ice-pack from a nearby rack of medical supplies; sighs) I-I couldn't stop her. I couldn't even slow her down."
GILES,Where are you?
BUFFY,"(puts the ice-pack inside her jacket, on her shoulder) Sunnydale Memorial."
GILES,"Are you badly hurt? I'll, I'll come right over."
BUFFY,"No. No, I-I just wanted to warn you that that thing she conjured, it's loose -- it's a big snake thing. Not mayor big, but it's pretty (winces) lethal looking."
GILES,Do you know why she raised it?
BUFFY,I don't know yet.
GILES,"I'll warn the others. We'll get weapons, we'll fan out-"
BUFFY,Wait. What time is it?
GILES,"(looks at his watch) Half past four, why?"
BUFFY,School's out. Dawn's on her way over to you. Giles-
GILES,Understood. We'll keep her safe here until you arrive.
BUFFY,Thanks. And Giles...
GILES,Yes?
BUFFY,Dawn's kind of fragile right now. About Mom. She doesn't know how bad it is.
GILES,We'll not say a word.
BUFFY,"(sighs) Well, my mom's gonna wake up soon, and I should ... be there when the doctors tell her."
GILES,"She's in good hands, Buffy. There's really nothing else you can do."
BUFFY,Okay. Bye.
GILES,Bye.
DAWN,Is she awake yet?
BUFFY,Yeah. She's waiting for us.
DAWN,Can we take her home now?
BUFFY,We'll see. Go get your stuff.
BUFFY,"(sighs, speaks quietly to Willow and Giles) So, any monster reptile sightings?"

JOYCE,"Oh. Do I have bad hair? (puts hands to her head) I don't look like scary mom, do I?"

BUFFY,(puts her other hand over Joyce's) I will.
