Buffy,This is so unfair.
Willow,I don't think it's that bad.
Buffy,It's the Ueber-suck. Mom could've at least warned me.
Xander,"Well, a lot of parents are doing it this year. It's part of  this whole cultural exchange magilla. The exhibit, the dance..."
Willow,I have the best costume for the dance!
Buffy,"A complete stranger in my house for two weeks. I'm gonna be  insane! A danger to myself and others within three days, I swear."
Xander,I think the exchange student program's cool. (gets a look from  Buffy) I do! It's a beautiful melding of two cultures.
Buffy,Have you ever done an exchange program?
Xander,My dad tried to send me to some Armenians once. Does that  count?
Cordelia,Ooo! There's mine! Sven. Isn't he lunchable? Mine's  definitely the best.
Buffy,What're you lookin' at?
Cordelia,"Pictures of our exchange students. Look. 100% Swedish, 100%  gorgeous, 100% staying at my house! So, how's yours? Visually, I mean."
Buffy,I don't know. Guy like?
Xander,"By guy-like we are talking big, beefy, guy-like girl, right?"
Buffy,I was just told 'guy'.
Cordelia,You didn't look at him first? He could be dogly. You live on  the edge. (walks off)
Xander,"Hold on a sec. So, this person who's living with you for two  weeks is a man. With man parts. This is a terrible idea."
Willow,What about the beautiful melding of two cultures?
Xander,"There's no melding, okay? He better keep his parts to himself."
Buffy,What's he doing?
Xander,"Uh, that's Rodney Munson. He's God's gift to the bell curve."
Xander,What he lacks in smarts he makes up in lack of smarts.
Willow,You just don't like him 'cause of that time he beat you up  every day for five years.
Xander,Yeah. I'm irrational that way.
Buffy,(smiles) I better stop him before he gets in trouble.
Willow,I got it. The non-violent approach is probably better here.  (goes over to Rodney)
Buffy,I wasn't gonna use violence. I don't always use violence. (looks  up at Xander) Do I?
Xander,The important thing is *you* believe that.
Rodney,"What're you... (looks up) Oh. Willow, hi."
Willow,That's probably not something you're supposed to be doing. You  could get in trouble.
Rodney,"(facetiously) Oh, no. And they might kick me outta school?"
Willow,(smiles) Are we still on for our chem tutorial tomorrow?
Rodney,Yeah. I think I got almost all fourteen natural elements  memorized.
Willow,There're a hundred and three.
Guide,"Welcome, students. We shall now proceed into the Incan burial  chamber. The human sacrifice is about to begin."
Xander,"Typical museum trick. Promise human sacrifice, deliver old pots  and pans."
Guide,"Five hundred years ago, the Incan people chose a beautiful  teenage girl to become their princess."
Willow,"I hope this story ends with, 'And she lived happily ever  after.'"
Xander,"(looks into the coffin) No, I think it ends with, 'And she  became a scary, discolored, shriveled mummy.'"
Guide,"The Incan people sacrificed their princess to the mountain god  Sebancaya, an offering buried alive for eternity in this dark tomb."
Willow,"They could've at least wrapped her in those nice white  bandages, like in the movies?"
Guide,The princess remained there protected only by a cursed seal  placed there (points to the plate in the mummy's hands) as a warning to  any who would wake her.
Xander,"So, Buffy, when's exchange-o boy making his appearance?"
Buffy,His name's Ampata. Gonna be at the bus station tomorrow night.
Xander,Ooo. The Sunnydale bus depot. Classy! What a better way to  introduce someone to our country than with the stench of urine.
Guide,"Now, if you'll follow me this way, please."
Rodney,Aha. Cool.
Rodney,Oh! Damn!
Buffy,"So, can I go?"
Giles,I think not.
Buffy,(pouts) How come?
Giles,Because you are the Chosen One.
Buffy,Mm. Just this once I'd like to be the Overlooked One.
Giles,"Well, I'm... afraid that is not..."
Giles,You have responsibilities that other girls do not.
Buffy,"Oh! I know this one! Slaying entails certain sacrifices, blah,  blah, bity blah, I'm so stuffy, gimme a scone."
Giles,(sarcastically) It's as if you know me.
Giles,Your secret identity is gonna be difficult enough to maintain  while this exchange student is living with you.
Xander,Nooot... *with* her. In the same house as her. Am I the only  one who's objective enough to make that distinction? (goes to the  counter)
Buffy,"So! I think going to the dance like a normal person would be the  best way to keep that secret. Giles, come on, budge! No one likes a non- budger."
Giles,FINE!
Giles,Go.
Buffy,(smiles) Yay! I win.
Giles,"I'll just go and introduce my shoulder to a, an icepack."
Xander,"(hops off of the counter) So, I guess we're dance-bound. Cool.  I think I can get my mom's car, so I'm wheel man."
Buffy,I thought you were taking Willow.
Xander,"Well, yeah, I'm gonna take Willow, but I'm not gonna *take*  Willow. In the sense of 'take me'. See, with you we're three and  everybody's safe. Without you, we're two."
Buffy,"Ah, and we enter dateville. Romance, flowers..."
Xander,Lips.
Buffy,"Oh, come on. In all the years you've know Willow, you've never  thought about her lips?"
Xander,"Buffy, I love Willow."
Xander,And she's my best friend. Which makes her not the kind of girl  who I think about her lips that much.
Xander,She's the kind of girl that... I'm best friends with.
Willow,Hey guys.
Xander,Willow! (goes to her) Hi! We were just talkin' about happy  things.
Xander,Like the three of us going to the dance together. See? (laughs)  Happy!
Xander,Not happy.
Willow,"No. Uh, oh, y-yes. No. Rodney's missing."
Giles,(comes out of his office with an ice pack) Trouble with Mr.  Munson again? (puts it on his shoulder)
Willow,His parents say he never came home last night.
Buffy,"Y'know, I don't think I remember seeing Rodney on the bus back  from the field trip."
Willow,I didn't either. I hope he didn't get in trouble at the museum.
Xander,"(chuckles) Hey, maybe he awakened the mummy."
Willow,"(giggles) Right, and it rose from its tomb."
Buffy,(smiles) And attacked him. (nods)
Willow,"On the other hand, maybe Rodney just stepped out for a smoke."
Xander,For twenty-one hours?
Willow,"It's addictive, you know."
Giles,We'll deal with that when we've... ruled out evil curses.
Buffy,One day I'm gonna live in a town where evil curses are just  generally ruled out without even saying.
Giles,There was a seal?
Buffy,It was right here. And it's broken. (picks up the largest piece)
Willow,Does that mean the mummy's loose?
Buffy,"No, comfy as ever. (hands the piece to Giles)"
Giles,Look at this series of pictograms.
Xander,"Okay, I just saved us, right?"
Buffy,Something did.
Giles,"Well, we'll fret about the details later. Let's just get out of  here before he comes back."
Willow,"Giles, were the Incas very advanced?"
Giles,"Yes, yes, very."
Willow,Did they have orthodontists?
Willow,Rodney looked like he had been dead for five hundred years. How  could that be?
Xander,Maybe we should ask that crazy man with the big old knife.
Buffy,I don't think he seemed overly chatty.
Willow,"The way he bolted when he saw Rodney, I'd say he was as freaked  as we were."
Giles,"My resources on this subject are extremely limited. I-I gather  that this particular mummy was from the Sebancaya region of eastern  Peru. It's very remote. Now, if there's an answer, then it's, it's  locked in the..."
Buffy,...in the seal.
Giles,"(looks at the seal) It's gonna take me weeks to... translate  these pictograms. Well, we'll start tonight with..."
Buffy,Ampata!
Giles,I was gonna suggest hunting.
Buffy,"No, I'm late. I told my mom I'd pick him up."
Xander,"Uh-uh-uh, Buffy? Where are your priorities? Tracking down a  mummifying killer or making time for some Latin lover whose stock in  trade is the breakage of hearts?"
Buffy,"Ampata's there alone. And I-I don't know how good his English  is. He's here from South A... South America. Hey, y'know, maybe he could  translate the seal."
Xander,"Oh, yeah. Fall for the old 'let me translate that ancient seal  for ya' come on. Tsh. D'ya know how many times I've used that?"
Mummy,Ampata...
Mummy,Ampata...
Ampata,Hello?
Buffy,Forty minutes late. Welcome to America!
Willow,What if he left already?
Buffy,(calls out) Ampata? Ampata Gutierrez?
Xander,"So, do we have to speak Spanish when we see him? 'Cause I don't  know anything much besides Doritos and Chihuahua."
Buffy,Ampata?
Ampata,Here!
Ampata,Hello.
Ampata,I am Ampata.
Xander,Ay caramba! I can also say that!
Buffy,Dining room...
Buffy,And this (turns on the light) is the kitchen.
Ampata,(amazed) It's very good!
Buffy,"Yeah, you got your stove, your fridge, it's fully functional.  We're very into it."
Xander,(slow and over-pronounced) Would you like a drink? (gestures)
Buffy,"(opens the fridge) Uh, let's see, we've got milk, and, uh, oh,  older milk... Juice?"
Ampata,Please.
Willow,"So, Ampata. You're a girl."
Ampata,Yes. For many years now.
Willow,"And not a boy, 'cause we thought a boy was coming, and here ya  are in a girl way!"
Xander,"It's just one of those crazy mix-ups, Will."
Buffy,"So, have you ever been to America before? (sets out glasses)"
Ampata,"Uh, I, I have toured."
Xander,(slow English again) Where did... you go?
Ampata,"I was taken to Atlanta, Boston, New York."
Willow,New York! That's exciting. What was that like?
Ampata,I did not see so much.
Xander,Your English is... very bueno.
Ampata,I listened much.
Xander,"Well, that works out well, because I talk much. (they laugh)"
Buffy,Hey! Sorry about the teeniness of the room.
Ampata,My old one was much smaller.
Buffy,(sits on her bed) What's it like back home?
Ampata,"Cramped, and... very dead."
Buffy,"Well, you'll feel right at home in Sunnydale."
Ampata,"Oh, no! Ohhhh! (gets up) But... but you have so *much* here!  (picks up a picture)"
Buffy,How 'bout friends?
Ampata,They are... (puts the picture down) It is just me.
Buffy,"I've been there. But, hey! You'll meet lots of people tomorrow."
Ampata,"Thank you. (goes back to her bed) You must teach me everything  about your life. I want to fit in, Buffy. Just like you. A normal life."
Buffy,One normal life. Comin' up.
Cordelia,"Devon, I told you I'd be at the dance tonight, but I am *not*  one of your little groupies. I won't be all doe-eyed looking up at you,  standing at the edge of the stage."
Devon,Got it.
Cordelia,"So, I'll see you afterwards?"
Devon,Sure. Where do you wanna meet?
Cordelia,I'll be standing at the edge of the stage.
Devon,(looks over at Sven) With that guy?
Cordelia,"(looks also) Sven! Momento! Needa! (to Devon) This whole  student exchange thing has been a horrible nightmare. They don't even  speak American. So, I'll see you later? (she allows him a kiss on the  cheek) Bye!"
Cordelia,Sven! Come?
Devon,"Oz, man! What do you think?"
Oz,Of what?
Devon,"Cordelia, man!"
Oz,She's a wonderland tour.
Devon,"You gotta admit, the girl is hot!"
Oz,"Yeah, she's a hot girl."
Devon,Let me guess: not your type? What does a girl have to do to  impress you?
Oz,"Well, it involves a feathered boa and a theme to 'A Summer Place'.  I can't discuss it here."
Devon,"You're too picky, man. Do you know how many girls you could  have? You're lead guitar, Oz. It's currency!"
Oz,I'm not picky. You're just impressed by any pretty girl that can  walk and talk.
Devon,She doesn't have to talk.
Willow,I worked really hard on my costume. It's pretty cool.
Xander,"Okay, but what about me? I've gotta think."
Willow,"Well, it's a celebration of cultures. There are lots of dress- up alternatives."
Xander,And a corresponding equal number of mocking alternatives. All  aimed at me.
Willow,Bavarians are cool.
Xander,"Okay, no shirts with ruffles, no hats with feathers and  definitely no lederhosen. They make my calves look fat."
Willow,Why are you suddenly so worried about looking like an idiot?  That came out wrong.
Buffy,Your first day of school. Nervous?
Ampata,It is just more people than I have seen in a long time.
Buffy,"Ah, don't worry. You will have no problems making friends. As a  matter of fact, I know someone who's dying to meet you."
Giles,"(shakes her hand, smiles) How do you do?"
Ampata,Hi.
Giles,"I was, I was wondering if you could, um, translate this? (shows  her the seal)"
Buffy,That was in no way awkward.
Buffy,Something wrong?
Ampata,"Uh, No! Uh, it is... Uh, why are you asking me?"
Giles,"Well, uh, uh... (coughs) It's, well, it's an artifact... from,  from, uh, your... region. I-it's, uh, from the tomb of a-an Incan mummy,  a-a-actually. We were trying to translate it, uh, um, as a-a project for  our, um..."
Willow,Our archeology club.
Giles,(impressed with her quick thinking) Very good.
Ampata,It is broken. Where are the other pieces?
Buffy,That's all we found.
Ampata,"Hmm. It is very old and valuable. (to Giles, holding the seal  out to him) You should hide it!"
Giles,"Is, is, uh, anything you recognize here? Um, um, this, this,  um... this ch-chap here with the knife, for instance?"
Ampata,"Well, I-I do not know exactly, but... I-I-I think this  represents, I believe the word is... 'bodyguard'?"
Giles,(takes the seal) Bodyguard? Interesting.
Ampata,Legend has it that he guards the mummy against those who would  disturb her.
Giles,"Well, uh, yes, well, that's, um, that's a very good starting  point for our, um... club. (looks at Buffy) Um..."
Buffy,"Oh, and, uh, a-as club president, I have, um, lots to do. Lots  of... stuff. Dull stuff. Uh, oh, Willow, maybe you could..."
Xander,Stay with Ampata for the day. I'd love to. (bows slightly and  smiles)
Ampata,(smiles) Yes! That will be fun.
Giles,"Right. I'll, uh, continue with the translation. Buffy, you  research this, uh, bodyguard thing, and, uh, Willow... (turns around)  Willow?"
Willow,(still staring after them) Boy. They really like each other.
Xander,And this (reaches into his satchel) is called a snack food.  (holds up a Twinkie)
Ampata,Snack food?
Xander,"Yeah. It's a delicious, spongy, golden cake stuffed with a  delightful creamy, white substance of goodness. And here's how you eat  it."
Xander,Mm-hm.
Ampata,"Oh, but now I cannot try it."
Xander,(with a full mouth) That's why you bring two.
Ampata,Oh! (studies it) Here goes!
Xander,"(mouth still full) Good, huh? And the exciting part is that  they have no ingredients that a human can pronounce. So it doesn't leave  you with that heavy... food feeling in your stomach."
Ampata,(mouth full) You are strange.
Xander,Girls always tell me that. Right before they run away.
Ampata,I like it!
Xander,I like you like it!
Xander,"Please, don't learn from my English."
Buffy,Ha! Or possible ha. (to Willow) Do you think this matches?
Buffy,Hey!
Willow,Oh! Yes. I'm caring about mummies.
Buffy,Ampata's only staying two weeks.
Willow,"Yeah. And then Xander can find someone else who's not me to  obsess about. At least with you I knew he didn't have a shot. Well, you  know, I have a choice. I can spend my life waiting for Xander to go out  with every other girl in the world until he notices me, or I can just  get on with my life."
Buffy,Good for you.
Willow,"Well, I didn't choose yet."
Giles,(inspecting the seal) Good Lord! (to Buffy) Good work!
Buffy,My work?
Giles,Yes. This is most illuminating. It seems Rodney's killer might  be the mummy.
Willow,Where does it say that?
Giles,"Well, here. It implies that the mummy is capable of... feeding  on the life force of a person, effectively freeze-drying them, you might  say. Extraordinary."
Buffy,"So, then we just have to stop the mummy. Which leads to the  question: how do we a) find, and b) stop the mummy?"
Giles,"Well, the answer to that is somewhere still in here. Or in the  rest of the seal."
Bodyguard,You stole the seal! Where is it?!
Bodyguard,It is you!
Giles,Here you are.
Ampata,Thank you.
Willow,"Why's this guy so into us? I mean, what's he want?"
Xander,"He said, 'Give me the seal.'"
Giles,"Apparently this is more popular than we realized. I just don't  know what we, we should do with it."
Ampata,"Destroy it. (gets a surprised look from Giles) If you do not,  someone could die."
Giles,I'm afraid someone already has.
Ampata,You mean the man with the knife killed someone?
Buffy,"Uh, no. Well, not exactly."
Ampata,You are not telling me everything. (looks at them all)
Xander,"You're right, Ampata. (takes her hand) And it's time we do.  We're not an archeology club. We're in, uh..."
Xander,"We're in the crime club. Which is kinda like the chess club,  only with crime, and, um... no chess."
Ampata,Please understand me. That seal nearly got us killed. It must  be destroyed!
Xander,Ampata!
Xander,"Ampata, listen to me. Nobody's gonna hurt you. I won't let  them."
Ampata,Your investigation is dangerous. I do not want that. Just  normal life!
Willow,Is she okay?
Xander,Wigged. I'm tryin' to convince her that our lives aren't just  danger and peril around here.
Willow,You should take her to the dance.
Xander,That's a good idea! We'll all go!
Willow,"No, I mean just you."
Xander,But you were psyched! And your costume!
Willow,I'll see you there.
Xander,"You know what, Willow? You're my best friend."
Willow,I know. (walks off)
Buffy,I don't get it. Why would the bodyguard have such a jones for a  broken piece of rock?
Giles,"Well, um, perhaps... he needs to put it together with the other  pieces."
Buffy,"If he has them. I mean, we didn't find them."
Giles,"And if he didn't then, then they'd still be at the museum."
Buffy,"So, maybe we should go there and find them. And odds are he'll  show up, too, right?"
Giles,And hopefully we'll be ready.
Buffy,Hey! Look at us! We came up with a plan. A good plan.
Giles,Alright. We'll meet there tonight after it closes.
Buffy,No! Bad plan. I have other plans. Dance plans. (gets a stern  look from Giles) (exhales) Canceled plans.
Xander,"Okay, I have something to tell you. And it's kind of a secret,  and it's, um, a little bit scary. I like you. A lot. And I want you to  go to with me the dance."
Ampata,(laughs) Why was that so scary?
Xander,"Well, because you never know if a girl's gonna say 'yes', or  if... she's gonna laugh in your face and pull out your still beating  heart and crush it into the ground with her heel."
Ampata,Hmm. Then you are very courageous. Can I tell you a secret?
Xander,Hmm.
Ampata,"I like you, too."
Xander,Really?
Ampata,Really!
Xander,That's great! Really?
Ampata,Really!
Xander,"That's great! You're not a praying mantis, are you? (gets a  confused look from her) Sorry, someone else."
Ampata,I will return to you. (starts away)
Xander,Where're you going?
Ampata,Where you cannot follow.
Xander,I'll wait outside. (smiles)
Ampata,I beg you... (turns to face him) Do not kill me.
Bodyguard,You are already dead. For five hundred years.
Ampata,But it was not fair. I was innocent.
Bodyguard,"The people you kill now so that you may live, they are  innocent."
Ampata,Please! I am in love!
Bodyguard,You are the Chosen One. You must die. You have no choice.
Ampata,"Yes, I do."
Ampata,I have thought. The dance?
Ampata,I will go with you.
Ampata,Gladly!
Ampata,"Buffy, I do not have any lipstick."
Buffy,Oh! You can borrow one of mine. There should be some on the  desk.
Ampata,What is that? (indicates the trunk)
Buffy,The station sent the rest of your stuff.
Ampata,"Oh. Of, of course. I, I forgot all about it. Uh, I will unpack  it later."
Buffy,No worries. I can do it.
Ampata,"Uh, but... you must get ready for the dance!"
Buffy,I'm not going.
Ampata,Why not?
Buffy,I have work to do. Crime club work. It's really nothing for you  to worry about. (sits on her bed)
Ampata,"Oh, I am not worried, thanks to Xander. (goes to the desk)"
Buffy,He seems very happy around you.
Ampata,"(sits at the desk) I am happy, too."
Ampata,"Mm, this one?"
Buffy,"Ooo, no, that clashes. There should be a gold one in there  somewhere."
Ampata,Thank you. You are always thinking of others before yourself.  You remind me of someone from very long ago: the Inca Princess.
Buffy,Cool! A princess.
Ampata,They told her that she was the only one. That only she could  defend her people from the nether world.
Ampata,Out of all the girls in her generation...
Ampata,...she was the only one...
Buffy,...chosen.
Ampata,(looks up at Buffy) Do you know the story?
Buffy,It's fairly familiar. (hands her the gold lipstick)
Ampata,"She was sixteen, like us. She was offered as a sacrifice and  went to her death. Who knows what she had to give up to fulfill her duty  to others? What chance at love?"
Buffy,Who knows? (goes back to Ampata's trunk) I'll just unpack the  rest of your stuff for you. (lifts the lid)
Ampata,"No, really, let me..."
Buffy,Oh!
Buffy,That's Xander and Willow. I'll get it.
Xander,I've come for the dance.
Buffy,"And, uh, what culture are you?"
Xander,I'm from the country of Leone. It's in Italy pretending to be  Montana. (looks Buffy up and down) And where are you from? The country  of White Trash?
Buffy,Mm. New line-up. You and Willow are taking Ampata. Giles and I  are hunting mummies. Where's you and Willow?
Xander,She's not coming... with us.
Buffy,"Oh! On a date. Romance, lips..."
Ampata,"Hello, Xander."
Xander,Hho hee ze thee ai uh...
Buffy,I can translate American salivating boy talk. He says you're  beautiful.
Xander,(to Buffy) Hyav su.
Buffy,You're welcome.
Joyce,"Ampata, don't you look wonderful! Oh, I wish you could talk my  daughter into going with you."
Ampata,"I tried, but she is very stubborn."
Joyce,"Well, I'm glad someone else sees that."
Ampata,"Well, good night, then."
Xander,Be careful.
Buffy,I will. (Xander turns to go) Hey! (he turns back) You look good.
Joyce,"Look at that. Two days in America, and Ampata already seems like  she belongs here. She's really fitting in. Hmm! (turns and heads up the  stairs)"
Buffy,Yeah. How 'bout that?
Lyrics,<I>She's in ecstasy / Her hollowed sky / Pours down heavenly /  Fakes desire</I>
Lyrics,<I>I've been living here / In the red / I've been feeling I'm /  Dead again</I>
Cordelia,Oh! Near faux pas! I almost wore the same thing.
Lyrics,<I>We've been bored before</I>
Cordelia,Hey!
Dawn,Where's Sven?
Cordelia,"Ohhh, I keep trying to ditch him. He's like one of those dogs  that you leave at the Grand Canyon on vacation? It follows you back  across four states. (Sven finds them) See? My own speechless, human  boomerang."
Lyrics,<I>I have never felt / So alone</I>
Dawn,He's kinda cute. Maybe it's nice skippin' all that small talk.
Cordelia,Small talk? How 'bout simple instruction?
Lyrics,<I>Since the time we left ourselves / Half past gone</I>
Cordelia,(to Sven) Get punchy. (points at him) You! Fruit drinky!
Lyrics,<I>We've been living here / Up against the red</I>
Dawn,He can follow me. (takes Sven's hand and leads him away)
Lyrics,<I>I've been feeling I'm / Dead again / We've been bored before</I>
Lyrics,<I>We'll be bored again / We've been bored before and again</I>
Willow,I think I should've worn something sexy.
Willow,Wow. You guys look great.
Ampata,"I-I love your costume. It's, it's very authentic."
Willow,Thanks.
Xander,"Yeah, you look, um... snug."
Willow,That's what I was going for. Where's Buffy?
Lyrics,<I>She's in ecstasy / Her hollowed sky</I>
Giles,Thank heavens you're home. (walks in)
Buffy,Yup! Not at the dance. Not with my friends. Not with a life.  What are you doing here? I thought we were gonna meet at the museum to  find the bodyguard.
Giles,"No, he's already been found. In a school restroom. Mummified."
Buffy,"Okay, I don't get it. Why would the mummy kill her own  bodyguard?"
Giles,"Well, I've cross-referenced, and, uh, I've looked at the  pictograms anew. He was a guard alright. But it was his job to insure  that the mummy didn't awaken and escape."
Buffy,"So, Ampata translated wrong."
Giles,Perhaps.
Buffy,Hold on a sec. She was wiggy about the seal from minute one.
Giles,"Yes, I suppose she was."
Buffy,Her trunks! (runs up the stairs)
Giles,I beg your pardon?
Giles,It's certainly all boys' clothes. Why would a girl pack these?
Buffy,How 'bout this one? What kind of girl travels with a mummified  corpse? And doesn't even pack a lipstick?
Lyrics,"<I>Time's healing, I'm ahead / Find a reason once again / Take a  moment outta time / I'll be standing back behind</I>"
Xander,"Do you, um... Would you like to, uh... you know..."
Lyrics,<I>On a wing / So outta line</I>
Ampata,I'd love to dance.
Lyrics,"<I>Mm, taken in / So outta time</I>"
Oz,Hey.
Oz,That girl. Who is she?
Devon,She's an exchange student. I think she's from South America.
Oz,"No, not her. The Eskimo!"
Lyrics,<I>Sound the season in my head</I>
Buffy,Come on! Can't you put your foot down?
Giles,It is down.
Buffy,One of these days you're gonna have to get a grownup car.
Lyrics,<I>...so outta time / All it takes is living / I want to fly</I>
Lyrics,<I>I've never known fate</I>
Lyrics,<I>I've never known your name</I>
Lyrics,<I>I've never known fate</I>
Xander,"Okay, at least I can rule out something I said."
Lyrics,<I>Someone take me home / Get me outta here</I>
Buffy,I should've guessed. Remember Ampata wanted us to hide the seal?
Giles,And then she wanted us to destroy it becau... Oh wait!
Buffy,"Uh, waiting..."
Giles,"Well, we already know that the seal was used to contain the  mummy. If breaking it freed her..."
Buffy,...reassembling it will trap her.
Giles,I'll go to the museum. I'll drop you off. I'll try to piece  together the fragments there.
Buffy,"Okay, I'll still get Xander. Before he gets smoochy with Mummy  Dearest."
Xander,Have you seen Ampata? (Willow shrugs) What was that?
Willow,I shrugged.
Xander,Next time you should probably say 'shrug'. (walks off looking)
Willow,(watches him go) Sigh.
Sven,I thought this exchange student thing would be a *great* deal.  But look what I got stuck with! 'Momento!' 'Punchy fruity drinky!' Is  Cordelia even from this country?
Jonathon,Your hands feel kinda... rough.
Jonathon,Aren't you with Xander?
Ampata,(whispers) Does it look like I'm with Xander?
Xander,Ampata!
Jonathon,That's my cue to leave.
Xander,There you are. Why'd you run away?
Ampata,Because... I do not deserve you.
Xander,"What, you think that you don't deserve me? (laughs) Man, I love  you!"
Xander,Are those tears of joy? Pain? Revulsion? (comes closer)
Ampata,(crying) I am very happy. And very sad.
Xander,Then talk to me. Let me know what's wrong.
Ampata,I can't!
Xander,"Hey, I know why you can't tell me. (pushes her away to look at  her) It's a secret, right? (she nods) And if you told me, you'd have to  kill me. (smiles)"
Xander,"Oh! That was a bad joke. And the delivery was off, too. I'm  sorry. (pushes her away again) I, uh..."
Xander,I'm sorry.
Ampata,No! I can't.
Ampata,"Xander, I'm so sorry."
Giles,'Incan Cosmology unites the bird head with its paler twin.'  (looks around for the proper piece) Um... Oh! Here. Its paler twin.
Ampata,The seal!
Buffy,Where's Xander?
Willow,He's looking for Ampata.
Buffy,We need to find him. Ampata's the mummy.
Willow,Oh. (absorbs the information and smiles) Good. (realizes its  implication) Xander!
Buffy,Where'd they go?
Willow,"Backstage, I think."
Oz,"Hey, I... (watches them go in surprise, then smiles) Who is that  girl?"
Buffy,Are you okay?
Xander,"(weakly) I think so. Boy, that was some kiss!"
Buffy,Where's Ampata?
Xander,She said something about the seal.
Buffy,The seal! Giles! C'mon.
Xander,What's goin' on?
Willow,He doesn't know?
Buffy,We'll tell him on the way.
Giles,"There, that's it. (sniffles) Just one more piece."
Buffy,I'll say one thing for you Incan mummies. (Ampata looks at her)  You don't kiss and tell.
Ampata,Looks like you've been keeping secrets from me! (shoves Giles  into the coffin) You're not a normal girl.
Buffy,And you are?
Ampata,This won't hurt!
Xander,"Let her go! (calmly walks in) If you're gonna kiss anybody, it  should be me."
Ampata,"Xander, we can be together. (looks at Willow) Just... just let  me have this one."
Xander,That's never gonna happen.
Ampata,I must do it. I must do it now! Or it is the end for me and for  us!
Xander,NO! (pulls Willow away from her) You want life? You're gonna  have to take mine. Can you do that?
Ampata,Yes!
Xander,"(exhales) I'm really the Fun-Talking Guy today, huh? Sorry."
Buffy,That's okay. You don't have to talk.
Xander,"I just, present company excluded, I have the worst taste in  women of anyone in the world, ever."
Buffy,"Ampata wasn't evil. At least not to begin with, and... I-I do  think she cared about you."
Xander,"Yeah, but I think that whole sucking the life out of people  thing would have been a strain on the relationship."
Buffy,"She was gypped. She was just a girl, and she had her life taken  away from her."
Buffy,I remember how I felt when I heard the prophecy that I was gonna  die. I wasn't exactly obsessed with doing the right thing.
Xander,"Yeah, but you did. You gave up your life."
Buffy,I had you to bring me back.
