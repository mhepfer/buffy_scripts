Walsh,"Almost time to wake up, Adam, and take your first look at the world.  I know you're gonna make me proud."
Walsh,Aah!
Adam,"Spike, I want you to come with me.  You're going to help me with my problem."
Spike,Slayer's got powers.
Adam,Take them away from her.
Spike,"This all goes down, the chip comes out."
Adam,Scout's Honor.
Forrest,"Riley had a career.  He had a future 'till he met you and yeah, I got a problem with that."
Adam,Thank you.
Buffy,"Okay, Adam was at that cave, so maybe he was there for a reason.  I'll go back, I'll scope it out--"
Giles,You don't train with me anymore.  He's going to kick your ass.
Buffy,Giles!
Xander,Stupid.  So you finally had the guts to say it to my face.
Willow,What exactly do you mean by 'witch stuff'?
Buffy,"You guys, what is happening?!"
Willow,"Buffy, things have been wrong for a while!"
Buffy,I'm starting to understand why there's no ancient prophecy about a Chosen One and her friends.
Buffy,"If I need help, I'll go to someone I can count on."
Adam,I've been waiting for you.
Riley,And now I'm here.
Buffy,Riley?
Buffy,Riley?
Adam,"Your thoughts are troubled.  In turmoil.  I understand, brother. We have a lot to discuss.  Speak."
Riley,What have you done to me?
Adam,"Nothing.  It was mother, Your...Professor Walsh.  She implanted the behavior modifier."
Riley,A chip in my head.  She really did it.
Adam,"Actually, the chip is here. (points to his chest) Tied directly into your central nervous system through your thoracic nerve.  This is Phase One of your preparation.  It lay dormant until the time came.  I simply activated it, brother."
Riley,"Stop calling me that.  I'm not your brother.  You're a botched science experiment.  I'm a human being, who's gonna do everything in his power to--"
Adam,Sit.
Adam,"You have no power.  Not yet.  Once you forget your old life and embrace your destiny as I have, you will know power you've never dreamed of.  I think you're going to like it."
Adam,Humans claim to old ways and ancient feuds.  And they're hopeless with technology.  Unworthy. (he turns around)
Riley,Not really wanting a lecture right now.
Adam,"Disappointed by demon-kind, we turned to humans.  Smart, adaptive, (he turns around) but emotional and weak.  Blind.  There's imperfection everywhere.  Something must be done.  Who will deliver us?"
Adam,Mother.  She saw our future.  Yours and mine.  She saw that you were necessary.  She saw the role you will play by my side.  Stand up.
Adam,"You see, we are brothers after all."
Spike,It warms the cockles of my non-beating heart seeing you lads together.
Adam,"I didn't send for you, Spike."
Spike,"Yeah, well...I'm not much the being-sent-for type."
Spike,"I'm much more the ""I did my part, now get this chip out of my head"" kind of guy."
Spike,Slightly stiffer than usual.
Spike,"Subtle, but I like it."
Spike,What's with him?
Adam,I activated his chip.
Spike,"Oh, so, it's chips all around, is it?  Someone must've bought the party-pack."
Adam,You get yours removed when the Slayer is where I want her.
Spike,She's separated from her friends.
Spike,They want nothing to do with her.
Spike,She's all alone.
Adam,"That's how I want her.  Where I want her is down in the Initiative.  (stops walking) She will ensure that as many demons die as humans, she will achieve maximum carnage before she's too weak to go on."
Riley,No.  You can't--
Adam,Stop talking.
Spike,"Right.  The Initiative.  But getting her there--that's what the bleeding disks are for, isn't it?  Our little witch gives her the info and pop--Alice heads back down the rabbit hole."
Adam,The witch.
Spike,"Uh, Willow.  (uses his hands to demonstrate height) About so high, perky, good with math.  Natural choice."
Adam,A friend.
Spike,Right.
Adam,One of the friends from whom you so efficiently separated her.
Spike,"Damn right I did.  You should've seen her.  They won't be talking to each other for a long, long--"
Spike,Hang on.  I think I might've detected a small flaw.
Adam,So you failed.
Spike,"Well, hey, you're supposed to be so smart.  (he stands up) You let me plan this thing.  Okay, let's not quibble about who failed who. The important thing is make sure the Slayer is where we want--"
Adam,Go.
Spike,Gone.
Spike,"So, uh, we'll do this chip thing when I get back."
Giles,Oh...
Willow,Hey.
Giles,"Hello.  (looks down at his clothes) Um, oh, uh, pardon the robe.  It's a bit of a late start."
Willow,Right.
Tara,"I hope you're feeling all right, Mr. Giles."
Giles,"Oh, yes, quite well, thank you.  I'll--I'll probably have a brisk jog later on.  Did you want something?"
Willow,I forgot my laptop and the disks.
Giles,"(takes off his glasses) Uh, yes, please, please come in."
Giles,"Will you be working here?  Uh, typing...talking?  Because, um, that will be fine."
Willow,"(smiling) No, that's okay."
Willow,Got 'em.  So...see ya.
Giles,"Right.  Yes, well, good luck with--with all that."
Willow,Ok.  Bye.
Tara,Bye.
Giles,Bye.
Anya,(o.s.) Xander?
Anya,You said you wanted to check the board at the unemployment office this morning.
Anya,You can't go like that.  They won't even interview you if you're naked.
Xander,I'm not going.  There's never anything good.
Anya,(sighs)
Xander,Maybe I should join the Army.
Anya,Don't they make you get up really early in the morning?
Xander,"Oh, yeah."
Xander,Never mind.
Anya,Are you still upset about that fight you had with your friends? It was hours ago!  Get over it.
Xander,"Anya, you--Forget it."
Anya,"So, they all think you're lost, directionless loser with no plans for his future?  Pfft."
Xander,"Anya, you can't ""pfft"" that stuff away."
Anya,Why not?
Xander,I don't know.  'Cause I think maybe they're right.
Anya,"So what if they are?  You're a good person, and a good boyfriend, and...and I'm in love with you.  Whatever they think of you, it shouldn't matter."
Xander,"Yeah.  Yeah, it doesn't matter."
Buffy,(o.s.) Adam...where are you?
Adam,This is where it all happens.  Where the new race begins.
Riley,Where are we?
Adam,In the Initiative.  There are areas no one knew about beyond those that needed to.  Mother kept her secrets well.
Adam,Didn't you?
Adam,"This is all how she planned it, except she thought she would be alive."
Riley,Are you--
Riley,Is that what you were gonna do to me?
Adam,They're just workers.  You know your destiny is much greater.
Riley,"Forrest? Oh, God."
Forrest,God has nothing to do with it.
Spike,"Easy, Sheriff.  Watch where you point that thing."
Buffy,What are you doing here?
Spike,Looking for a little weekend getaway place.  Shove off.
Spike,"(sigh) Oh, cripes.  That's all I need.  Runnin' into that goon."
Buffy,"Yeah, well, Adam's cleared out of here.  Whatever he's planning is about to go down."
Spike,Look at little Nancy Drew.  What about those disks I nabbed? They ought to tell you something.
Buffy,Willow has the disks.
Spike,"Well, then I'd get on that."
Spike,"just 'cause you two birds fell out, now can you?"
Buffy,Right.
Spike,"Well, you do what you want."
Spike,"No worry of mine, now is it?"
Tara,Maybe you should rest.  Clear your head?
Willow,Can't.  (cut to the screen) Not now.  I--I think I'm on to something.  I've been assuming the (cut to the two)--the ciphertext was encrypted with an asymmetric algorithm.  Then it hit me.  A hexogonic key pattern.  It's--
Tara,"Hey, look, you did it."
Willow,I didn't.  I haven't even finished typing in the new code.
Tara,Something's doing it.
Willow,Must be programmed to (cut to the screen) self-decrypt to a certain point.  (cut back to Willow) That is so annoying.  It's like someone blurting out the answer to a riddle just when you've--I mean Yippee! We have the information.
Tara,"I'm not sure if ""Yippee""'s the right response, either.  Read that."
Tara,"Hello?  Yeah, she's right--I mean, let me check."
Tara,It's Buffy.
Riley,"Professor Walsh.  Professor Walsh, it's Riley Finn.  Can you hear me?"
Riley,So are you.
Forrest,Mm-mmm (No).  Got that wrong.  I'm surging with life...  and strength.  Adam made me to be nearly as bad as he is.  Really looking forward to trying out your girl again.
Riley,"I'm sorry, Forrest."
Forrest,"Don't be.  This is the best thing that ever happened to me. I'm free of all my weaknesses...my doubts.  He's gonna fix you up too, soon as we got some choice parts.  Then you and me will be back on the same side again.  Moving toward a new future."
Riley,I'll never let that happen.
Forrest,"You don't get it brother, you don't have a choice.  Your will belongs to us now."
Riley,No.  That's not true.
Forrest,Then why don't you get out of that chair and walk out of here?
Riley,You can't control my--
Walsh,"Riley, be a good boy."
Xander,"Oddly, Anya decided not to join us, despite all the fun we had at our last meeting."
Willow,And I don't think Tara felt welcome.
Buffy,Why?  Because of the things that we said?
Buffy,"Will, who told you we were talking behind your back, specifically?"
Giles,"Well, uh...S--S--Spike can be very convincing when--when--when, uh...I'm very stupid."
Buffy,He played us.  He wanted us to fight to split us up.  That's where it came from.  The stuff we said the other night.
Giles,"Of course.  Well, piffle, let's move on."
Xander,I'm movin'.
Willow,"Me, too."
Buffy,Good.  Great.
Willow,So...why do you think Spike made with the head games?
Xander,He's all dressed up with no one to bite.  He's gotta get his ya-yas somehow.
Xander,"Spike's working for Adam?!  After all we've done--nah, I can't even act surprised."
Buffy,"I just went to Adam's lair and he was gone.  But, Spike just happened to be there.  He made this big noise about getting information off those encrypted disks."
Willow,"Oh, I decrypted them."
Willow,"Well, they decrypted themselves, but I almost had it."
Giles,What did they say?
Willow,"A bunch of stuff we already know about 314.  But it also said there's some final phase where Adam manufactures a bunch of creepy cyber-demonoids like him.  There's a special lab in The Initiative, but it didn't say where."
Buffy,"Adam fed Spike those disks.  It has to be.  He wanted me to know about his evil-guy assembly line.  This lab, it's in the Initiative?"
Willow,Hidden somewhere.
Buffy,We'll give the demon his due.  He thought this one out.
Willow,What do you mean?
Buffy,You know how overcrowded the containment cells have been at the Initiative?
Buffy,Those demons were just too easy to catch.  It's like they wanted in that place.
Giles,(putting on his glasses) The Trojan horse.
Buffy,Adam's gonna make sure the demons attack the Initiative from the inside.
Xander,"Demons versus soldiers.  Massacre, massacre."
Willow,"And Adam has a neat pile of body parts to start assembling his army.  Diabolical, yet...(makes a face) Gross."
Xander,"Does anybody else miss the Mayor, I just wanna be a big snake?"
Buffy,"I've got to shut him down, Giles.  His final phase is about to start."
Giles,We need to warn the Initiative.
Buffy,They're not gonna listen to me.
Willow,Riley?
Buffy,"He's a deserter. He got some bad news anyway, and kinda took off."
Xander,"Okay, I'm confused again.  Adam has this evil plan.  Why is he so anxious for you to know about it?"
Buffy,He wants me there.  Probably figures I'll even the kill ratio.
Xander,"He's not worried you might kill, oh say, him?"
Buffy,"No, he's really not."
Adam,She's coming.  I can feel it.
Spike,"Good on you.  Got a chunk of prognosticating demon in there, right?"
Spike,"Now, (claps his hands) if you'll just get this chip out of my cranium...(he sits down) I'll be out of your way.  And mind the hairline.  I don't fancy fussing over a comb-over as I resume my killing ways.  Come on, we had a deal."
Adam,When she's here.
Spike,(sighs)
Giles,Certainly no lack of supplies.  I only wish I knew which ones would kill Adam.
Buffy,"According to Riley, his power source is uranium core embedded somewhere inside his chest.  Probably near the spine."
Xander,"Great, so we just ask him to lie down quietly while we do some exploratory surgery."
Willow,"What about magic?  Some kind of, I don't know...uranium extracting spell?"
Willow,I know.  I'm reaching.
Giles,Perhaps a paralyzing spell.
Giles,Only I can't perform the incantation for this.
Willow,Right.  Don't you have to speak it in Sumerian or something?
Giles,"I do speak Sumerian.  It's not that.  Only a...an experienced witch can incant it, and you'd have to be within striking distance of this object."
Xander,See what you get for takin' French instead of Sumerian?
Buffy,What was I thinking?
Xander,"So no problem, all we need is combo Buffy--her with Slayer strength, Giles' multi-lingual know how, and Willow's witchy power."
Xander,"Yeah, don't tell me.  I'm just full of helpful suggestions."
Giles,"As a matter of fact, you are."
Willow,Nervous?
Xander,No way.  I'm full of that good old kamikaze spirit.
Giles,"Xander, just because this is never gonna work, there's no need to be negative."
Willow,"The adjoining spell, is it powerful enough to defeat Adam?"
Giles,It's very powerful.  It's also extrodinarily dangerous.
Buffy,"Game faces, guys.  We're going in."
Buffy,How you doing?
Willow,"Super.  What was I thinkin', using stairs all this time?"
Buffy,Okay.  Will--
Willow,"No, really, Buffy.  It's not as scary as I thought."
Buffy,No.  It's not what I was gonna say.  I just...I'm sorry. I hate that things have been so strained between all of us.
Willow,It's not your fault.  Spike stirred up trouble.
Buffy,"Yeah, but I think trouble was stir-uppable.  I think we've all sort of drifted apart this year, don't you?"
Willow,"Maybe a little.  But, you know, first year of college, it's hard to keep the old high school gang together."
Buffy,"But I want it together.  Will, I miss you.  And Giles, and Xander.  And it is my fault.  I've been wrapped up in my own stuff, I've been a bad friend."
Willow,"You're the Slayer, Buffy.  Your stuff is pretty crucial."
Buffy,"I mean Riley.  And...Riley, mostly."
Willow,"Well, I haven't been Miss Available either.  I--I kept secrets.  I hid things from everyone."
Buffy,"That's not your fault.  Will, you were going through something huge."
Willow,"I wanted to tell you, but I was so scared."
Buffy,You can tell me anything.  I love you.  You're my best friend.
Willow,"Me, too.  I love you too."
Willow,"(o.s.) Oh, falling now!"
Buffy,Let's promise to never not talk again.
Willow,"I promise, I promise."
Buffy,Xander.
Willow,"Oh, wonderful Xander!"
Buffy,"You know we love you, right?"
Willow,We totally do.
Xander,"Oh God, we're gonna die, aren't we?"
Willow,"No, we just missed you."
Xander,"Giles, hurry up!"
Xander,You definitely wanna get down here for this!
Buffy,"Okay, we stick together, then everything should be fine. Everybody ready?"
Buffy,Let's...
Buffy,...do this.
Spike,Must-See-TV.  Bait's been taken.  Trap's all set.  The Slayer has landed.  So...
Spike,Hello???  Paging Dr. Owe Me One.
Adam,She's not alone.
Adam,(o.s.) You've failed me again.
Spike,"Well, that's one way of looking at it."
Adam,What's the other way.
Spike,"Oh, come on!  It's not like I wasn't trying!  That's worth something, isn't it?"
Adam,I suppose.  Yes.  I will honor our agreement to remove your chip.
Adam,Take his head off.
Forrest,(screams)
Adam,Let him go.
Adam,There's nowhere left to run.
Buffy,Colonel--
Colonel,"Shut up.  You've got some nerve, lady.  (unzips the bag) You think you and your friends can just keep waltzing into a government installation brandishing weapons like--"
Colonel,Like--
Willow,It's a gourd.
Giles,Magic gourd.
Colonel,What kind of freaks are you people? (puts the gourd down)
Buffy,"Adam is here, Colonel.  In the Initiative."
Colonel,Nice try.
Buffy,"Those overcrowded containment cells of yours: courtesy of Adam. He's pulling a Trojan Horse on you, he's just waiting--"
Colonel,Everything in this installation is under 24-hour surveillance.
Willow,Including the secret lab?
Colonel,Including everything!  (a beat) What secret lab?
Buffy,The one Adam's been using.  The one built for the final stage of the 314 project.
Buffy,And you have no idea what I'm talking about.
Colonel,I know everything that goes on around here.  A tick on a mouse couldn't get in without my knowing it.  And if Adam wants to try we're ready for him.
Giles,Jolly good.  How--How exactly do you plan to get close enough to Adam to remove his power source?
Colonel,Hit him simultaneously with multiple taser blasters. Incapacitate him with as much voltage as we can muster.
Xander,"Great plan.  That's right up there with ""duck and cover""."
Buffy,I've seen Adam hit with taser blasts.  He feeds on it.  And now you're gonna provide him with an all-you-can-eat buffet?
Colonel,You telling me my business?
Buffy,"This...is not your business.  It's mine.  You, the Initiative, the boys at the Pentagon--you're all in way over your heads.  Messing with primeval forces you have absolutely no comprehension of."
Colonel,And you do?
Buffy,I'm the Slayer.  You're playing on my turf.
Colonel,"Up there, maybe.  But down here, I'm the one who's in control."
Soldier,"Sir, the power grid's down.  Backup's not responding."
Soldier,We're locked in.
Adam,This will be interesting.
Scientist,(scared) What's going on?
Scientist,Go!
Scientist,(screaming)
Soldier,Containment area's been breached.  Hostiles are loose.
Colonel,How many?
Soldier,"All of 'em, Sir."
Buffy,(o.s.) It's Adam.
Buffy,"Look, I'm the only one who can stop him now.  Just let me handle this.  Get your people out of here."
Colonel,"All right, you men follow me.  We gotta take the Armory now."
Buffy,Colonel.
Colonel,"These people are under arrest, do you understand?"
Buffy,We've gotta find Adam.
Willow,On it.
Giles,"The enjoining spell (cut to Buffy) is extremely touchy.  It's, uh, (cut to Willow) volatile.  We--We can't risk it (cut to Buffy) being interrupted.  We need a place that's (cut to Giles and Xander) close to you and quiet."
Xander,(o.s.) Uh...quiet?
Buffy,"How we doing, Will?"
Willow,"Done.  Hold on.  According to this, there's air ducts and electrical conduits (cut to the screen) all running into there."
Buffy,So?
Willow,"So, there's no there there.  Look."
Buffy,It's Adam.
Giles,You sure?
Buffy,Right behind 314.
Buffy,Can you unlock it?
Willow,I don't have to.  All--All the locks in the Initiative have been disengaged...except for the exits.
Xander,Demon open house.
Buffy,Great.  So we know we're going to 314.  Now all we have to do is get there.
Buffy,"Willow, down!"
Buffy,Come on!
Willow,Go!
Buffy,"Okay, it should be over here."
Buffy,"Once I'm in, barricade the door behind me.  Is this place okay to be Magic Central?"
Giles,"It, uh, should do."
Willow,As long as we don't get blowed up or nothin'.
Xander,What're the odds of that?
Buffy,How long before the ritual kicks in?
Giles,"Five minutes, give or take."
Xander,"Buffy, I still don't like you going in alone."
Buffy,I won't be.
Buffy,Riley.
Buffy,Are you hurt?  (no answer) Say something!
Buffy,What is this?
Buffy,Why won't you talk to me?
Adam,(o.s.) He can't.
Adam,He hasn't been programmed to.  He's part of the final phase now...as you were supposed to be.
Buffy,Sorry.  I don't jump through hoops on command.  I've never really been one to tow the line.
Adam,Oh.  (beat) Kill her.
Forrest,I thought you'd never ask.
Willow,"(chanting) ""The power of the Slayer and all who yield it. Last to ancient first, we invoke thee.  Grant us thy domain and primal strength.  Accept us in the power we possess.  Make us mind and heart and spirit joy.  Let the hand encompass us.  Do thy will."""
Riley,Buffy.
Forrest,"Shut up, and watch me kill your girlfriend, Finn.  That's an order."
Willow,Spiritus...Spirit.
Xander,Animus...Heart.
Giles,Sophus...Mind.
Willow,And Manus...
Willow,(o.s.) The hand.
Riley,(groans)
Willow,We enjoin that we may inhabit the vessel--the hand...daughter of Sineya...first of the ones...
Forrest,Is that it?  Is that all you got?
Riley,No.
Riley,She's got me.
Forrest,Look who's come off the bench.
Buffy,"I need to get to Adam.  Like, now.  Are you able?"
Riley,Go.
Colonel,Fall back!  Fall back!  Protect the flank!  Walk down that pit!
Buffy,"Fun, isn't it?"
Adam,I do appreciate violence.
Buffy,Good.
Buffy,Broke your arm.
Adam,Got another.
Adam,I've been upgrading.
Willow,"We implore thee, admit us, bring us to the vessel, take us now."
Adam,You can't last much longer.
Buffy,(speaking simultaneous) We can.  We are forever.
Buffy,(Speaking Sumerian)
Adam,Interesting.
Buffy,(Continues speaking Sumerian)
Adam,Very interesting.
Forrest,What're you makin' me do this for?
Forrest,Not that I'm not enjoyin' myself.
Forrest,But Adam's not gonna like it if I--
Forrest,(growls)
Buffy,(Sumerian) Kur.
Adam,How...can you--
Xander,You could never hope to grasp the source
Buffy,of our power.
Buffy,But yours is right here.
Adam,(groans)
Riley,Buffy.
Willow,Wow.  That was--
Spike,"Nasty sort of fellow.  Lucky for you blighters I was here, eh?"
Giles,"Yes, thank you."
Giles,Although your heroism has been slightly muted by the fact that you were helping Adam to start a war that would kill us all.
Xander,You probably just saved us so we wouldn't stake you right here.
Spike,Did it work?
Spike,"Well, then everything's all right.  And we all get to be not staked through the heart.  Good work, team."
Giles,Buffy.
Willow,Wasn't it amazing?
Xander,You were great.
Buffy,We were great.
Riley,We still got men out there.
Spike,"Well, let's go save 'em, by gum."
Buffy,"You guys get to the exits, get 'em open."
Buffy,"You, organize the soldiers, pull 'em back.  I'll take point."
Willow,Are you up to this?
Buffy,I am.
Man,"It was an experiment.  The Initiative represented the Government's interests in not only controlling the otherworldly menace, but harnessing its power for our own military purposes.  The considered opinion of this counsel is that this experiment has failed."
Man,It is therefore our recommendation that this project be terminated and all records concerning it expunged.  Our soldiers'll be debriefed.  Standard confidentiality clause.  We will monitor the civillians and usual measures prepared should they try to go public. I don't think they will.
Man,"(o.s.) The Initiative itself will be filled in with concrete. Burn it down, gentlemen.  Burn it down, and salt the Earth."
