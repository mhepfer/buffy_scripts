character,dialogue
Master,Zachary didn't return from the hunt last night.
Darla,The Slayer.
Master,"Zachary was strong, and he was careful. And still the Slayer  takes him... as she has taken so many of my family. (takes a breath) It  wears thin. Collin, what would you do about it?"
Collin,I'd annihilate her.
Master,(inhales) Out of the mouths of babes...
Darla,"(makes her way down) Let me do it, Master. Let me kill her for  you."
Master,You have a personal interest in this.
Darla,(disappointed) I don't get to have any fun.
Master,I will send the Three.
Darla,(intrigued) The Three?
Boy,"Get it! Go get it, right there!"
Girl,I got it!
Girl,"Free drink, please."
Willow,"Ah, the fumigation party."
Buffy,Hmm?
Willow,It's an annual tradition. The closing of the Bronze for a few  days to nuke the cockroaches?
Buffy,(not paying attention) Oh.
Willow,It's a lot of fun... What's it like where *you* are?
Buffy,"(looks up and smiles) I'm... sorry, I was just... thinking about  things..."
Willow,"So, we're talking about a guy?"
Buffy,"Not exactly a guy. For us to have a conversation about a guy,  there'd have to be a guy for us to have a conversation about. Is that a  sentence?"
Willow,(smiles) You lack a guy.
Buffy,"I do. Which is fine with me, most of the time, but..."
Willow,What about Angel?
Buffy,"Angel? I can just see him in a relationship. 'Hi, honey, you're  in grave danger. I'll see you next month.'"
Willow,"He's not around much, it's true."
Buffy,(looks dreamily) When he is around... it's like the lights dim  everywhere else. You know how it's like that with some guys?
Willow,"Oh, yeah! (looks over at Xander)"
Xander,"Hey, Annie! (sees her boyfriend) Dino, just leaving!"
Cordelia,Ouch! Please get your extreme oafishness off my two-hundred- dollar shoes!
Xander,"I'm sorry, I was just..."
Cordelia,...getting off the dance floor before Annie Vega's boyfriend  squashes you like a bug?
Xander,"Oh, so you noticed."
Cordelia,Uh-huh.
Xander,"Yeah, thanks for being so understanding."
Cordelia,Sure.
Xander,"Y'know, hey, I don't know what everyone's talking about. That  outfit doesn't make you look like a hooker! (laughs)"
Xander,"Boy, that Cordelia is a regular breath of vile air. What are  you vixens up to?"
Willow,"Just sitting here, watching our barren lives pass us by. (sees  a roach) Oh, look, a cockroach. (stomps it)"
Xander,"Whoa, well, let's stop this crazy whirligig of fun! I'm dizzy!"
Buffy,"Alright, now I'm infecting those nearest and dear to me. I'm  gonna call it a night. (gets up)"
Willow,"Oh, don't go!"
Xander,"Uh, yeah! It's early! We could, um, dance!"
Buffy,Rain check? Good night. (leaves)
Willow,Want a free drink?
Buffy,"It's late, I'm tired, and I don't wanna play games. Show  yourself."
Buffy,(surprised) Wuh!
Buffy,"Ooo! Okay, okay, nice..."
Buffy,"Okay, okay... Look, I really don't wanna fight all three of  you... unless I have to."
Angel,Good dogs don't... (punches the vampire) ...*bite*!
Buffy,Look out!
Buffy,Run!
Buffy,Get in! C'mon!
Angel,It's alright. A vampire can't come in unless it's invited.
Buffy,"I've heard that before, but I've never put it to the test.  (leans on the door, sees his wound) Oh... I'll go get some bandages,  just... take your jacket and your shirt off."
Buffy,Nice tattoo. (exhales) I was lucky you came along. (looks up at  him) How did you happen to come along? (begins to bandage him)
Angel,I live nearby. I was just out walking.
Buffy,"So, you weren't following me? I just had this feeling you were."
Angel,(smiles) Why would I do that?
Buffy,"You tell me. You're the Mystery Guy that appears out of nowhere.  I'm not saying I'm not happy about it tonight, but... if you are hanging  around I'd like to know why. (finishes bandaging)"
Angel,Maybe I like you.
Buffy,Maybe...
Joyce,Hi! What are you doing?
Buffy,There's a lot of weird people outside at night...
Buffy,...I just feel better with you safe and sound inside. You must  be beat.
Joyce,I am. We're a little gallery. You have no idea how much...
Buffy,"(interrupts) Well, then why don't you go upstairs and get into  bed, and I can bring you some hot tea?"
Joyce,That's sweet! (suspiciously) What'd you do?
Buffy,Can't a daughter just be concerned about her mother?
Joyce,Hi.
Angel,Hi.
Buffy,"Oh! Okay... Um... Angel, uh, this is my mom. Mom, this is Angel.  Uh, we ran into each other on the way home."
Angel,Nice to meet you.
Joyce,"What do you do, Angel?"
Buffy,"He's a student. (her mother gives her a disbelieving look) Uh,  first year community college. Angel's been helping me with my history,  you know I've been toiling there."
Joyce,"It's a little late for tutoring. I'm gonna go to bed, and, uh,  Buffy? (starts up the stairs)"
Buffy,I'll say good night and do the same!
Joyce,(to Angel) It was nice to meet you.
Buffy,Good night! We'll hook up soon and do that study thing!
Angel,"Look, I don't wanna get you in any more trouble..."
Buffy,"And I don't wanna get you dead. They could still be out there.  (moves to the center of the room) So, uh, (realizes) oh... two of us,  one bed. That doesn't work. (faces him) Um, why don't you take the bed?  Y'know, you're wounded..."
Angel,I'll take the floor.
Buffy,"Uh, no, that's not..."
Angel,"(reassuringly) Oh, believe me, I've had worse."
Buffy,"Okay. Um, then why don't you check and see if the Fang Gang is  still loitering and, um, keep your back turned while I change?"
Angel,I don't see them.
Buffy,"Y'know, I'm the Chosen One, it's my job to fight guys like that.  What's your excuse?"
Angel,"Uh, somebody has to."
Buffy,"Well, what does your family think of your career choice?"
Angel,They're dead.
Buffy,Was it vampires?
Angel,(faces her) I-it was.
Buffy,I'm sorry.
Angel,It was a long while ago.
Buffy,"So, this is a vengeance gig for you."
Angel,(pauses) Y-you even look pretty when you go to sleep.
Buffy,"Well, when I wake up it's an entirely different story."
Buffy,Here. Sleep tight.
Buffy,Angel?
Angel,Hmm?
Buffy,Do you snore?
Angel,I don't know. It's been a long time since anybody's been in a  position to let me know.
Xander,He spent the night? In your room? In your bed?
Buffy,"Not *in* my bed, *by* my bed."
Willow,"That is so romantic! Did you, uh... I mean, did he, uh..."
Buffy,(smiling) Perfect gentleman.
Xander,"Buffy, c'mon, wake up and smell the seduction. It's the oldest  trick in the book."
Buffy,What? Saving my life? Getting slashed in the ribs?
Xander,"Duh! I mean, guys'll do anything to impress a girl. I-I once  drank an entire gallon of Gatorade without taking a breath. (grins)"
Willow,It was pretty impressive. Although later there was an ick  factor.
Giles,(coming to the table) Can we steer this riveting conversation  back to the events that happened earlier in the evening? (Buffy sits  down) You left the Bronze and were set upon by three unusually virile  vampires. (puts a book in front of her) Did they look like this?
Buffy,Yeah. What's with the uniforms?
Giles,"It seems you encountered the Three. Warrior vampires, very proud  and very strong."
Willow,(to Giles) How is it you always know this stuff? You always  know what's going on. I never know what's going on.
Giles,"Well, you weren't here from midnight until six researching it."
Willow,"No, I was sleeping."
Giles,"Uh, o-obviously you're hurting the Master very much. He, he  wouldn't send the, the Three for just anyone. We must step up our  training with weapons."
Xander,"Buffy, you should stay at my house until these Samurai guys are  history."
Buffy,(turns to him) What?
Xander,"Ah-ah-ah, don't worry about Angel, Willow can run to your house  and tell him to get out of town fast."
Giles,"Angel and Buffy are, are not in any immediate jeopardy.  Eventually the Master will send someone else, but in the mean time the  Three, having failed, will offer their own lives in penance."
Vampire,"We failed in our duty, and now our lives belong to you."
Master,"Pay attention, child. You are the Anointed, and there is much  you must learn. (crouches beside him) With power comes responsibility.  True, they did fail, but also true, we who walk at night share a common  bond. The taking of a life -- I'm not talking about humans, of course --  is a serious matter."
Collin,So you would spare them?
Master,"Hmm. (gets up) I am weary, and their deaths will bring me  little joy."
Master,"Of course, sometimes a little is enough."
Buffy,"Cool! Crossbow! (lifts it out, sees the bolts) Huh. Check out  these babies. (takes out a bolt) Hmm. Goodbye stakes, hello flying  fatality. What can I shoot?"
Giles,"Um, nothing. The crossbow comes later."
Giles,"You must first become proficient with the basic tools of combat.  (Buffy looks bored) And let's begin... (comes back with two poles)  ...with the quarterstaff. Which, incidentally, will, uh, require  countless hours of vigorous training. (hands her one) I speak from  experience."
Buffy,"Giles, 20th Century? I'm not gonna be fighting Friar Tuck."
Giles,"You never know with whom or what you'll be fighting. (puts on  his head pads) And these traditions have been handed down through the  ages. (grabs his staff) Now, you show me good, steady progress with the  quarterstaff, and in due course we'll discuss the crossbow. Put on your  pads."
Buffy,(laughs) I'm not gonna need pads to fight you.
Giles,"Well, we'll see about that. En garde!"
Giles,(stunned) Good. Let's move on to the crossbow.
Buffy,Angel?
Angel,Hey.
Buffy,"Brought you some dinner. It's a little plateless, sorry."
Buffy,So! What'd you do all day?
Angel,"Uh, I read a little."
Angel,"And just thought about a lot of things. Buffy, I..."
Buffy,"My diary? You read my diary? (goes to put it in a drawer) That  is *not* okay! A diary is like a person's most private place! (comes  back to him) I... You don't even know what I was writing about! 'Hunk'  can mean a lot of things, bad things. And, and when it says that your  eyes are 'penetrating', I meant to write 'bulging'."
Angel,Buffy...
Buffy,"And 'A' doesn't even stand for 'Angel' for that matter, it  stands for... 'Achmed', a charming foreign exchange student, so that  whole fantasy part has nothing to even do with you at all..."
Angel,"Your mother moved your diary when she came in to straighten up.  I watched from the closet. I didn't read it, I swear."
Buffy,"Oh! (looks down, realizing what she just said) Oh."
Angel,I did a lot of thinking today. I really can't be around you.  (Buffy looks up) Because when I am...
Buffy,"(looks down) Hey, no big. Water... over the bridge, under the  bridge..."
Angel,When I am all I can ever think about is how badly I want to kiss  you.
Buffy,...over the dam... (looks up at him) Kiss me?
Angel,"I'm older than you, and this can't ever... I better go."
Buffy,H-how much older?
Angel,I should...
Buffy,(approaches him) ...go... You said...
Buffy,What? What is it? What's wrong?
Joyce,"Buffy, what happened?"
Buffy,"Uh, nothing. I saw a shadow."
Willow,Angel's a vampire?
Buffy,"I can't believe this is happening. One minute we were kissing,  and the next minute... (to Giles) Can a vampire ever be a good person?  Couldn't it happen?"
Giles,"A vampire isn't a person at all. (clears his throat) It may have  the movements, the, the memories, even the personality of the person  that it took over, but i-it's still a demon at the core, there is no  halfway."
Willow,"So that'd be a no, huh?"
Buffy,"Well, then what was he doing? Why was he good to me? Was it all  some part of the Master's plan? It doesn't make sense!"
Xander,"Alright, uh... (sits also) ...you have a problem, and it's not  a small one. Let's take a breath and look at this calmly and  objectively. Angel's a vampire. You're a Slayer. I think it's obvious  what you have to do. (grins)"
Giles,"(crouches down) Uh, it is a Slayer's duty..."
Xander,"I-I know you have feelings for this guy, but it's not like  you're in love with him, right?"
Xander,"You're in love with a vampire?! What, are you outta your mind?!"
Cordelia,What?!
Xander,(to Cordelia) Not vampire... (to Buffy) How could you love an  umpire? Everyone hates 'em!
Cordelia,"Where did you get that dress? (pursues her) This is a one-of- a-kind Todd Oldham. Do you know how much this dress cost? Is this a  knockoff? (checks the label) This is a knockoff, isn't it?! Some cheesy  knockoff! This is exactly what happens when you sign these free trade  agreements!"
Buffy,You think *we* have problems...
Angel,Who's here?
Darla,A friend.
Darla,Hi. It's been a while.
Angel,A lifetime.
Darla,"Or two, but who's counting?"
Angel,What's with the Catholic schoolgirl look? Last time I saw you it  was kimonos.
Darla,And last time I saw you it wasn't high school girls. (flares the  skirt) Don't cha like? (approaches Angel) Remember Budapest? Turn of the  century? You were such a bad boy during that earthquake.
Angel,You did some damage yourself.
Darla,"Is there anything better than a natural disaster? (walks away)  The panic. The people lost in the streets. It's like picking fruit off  the vine. (reaches the bed) Nice! You're living above ground, like one  of them. You and your new friend are attacking us, like one of them.  (walks to the window) But guess what, precious? You're not one of them."
Darla,Are you?
Angel,No. But I'm not exactly one of you either.
Darla,(walks to the fridge) Is that what you tell yourself these days?
Darla,"You're not exactly living off quiche. (closes the fridge) You  and I both know what you hunger for. (goes over to him) What you need.  Hey, it's nothing to be ashamed of. It's who we are. It's what makes  eternal life worth living. (smiles and touches him) Mm. You can only  suppress your real nature for so long. You can feel it brewing inside of  you. I hope I'm around when it explodes."
Angel,Maybe you don't wanna be.
Darla,"I'm not afraid of you. I bet she is, though. (starts to leave)  Or maybe I'm underestimating her. Talk to her. Tell her about the curse.  Maybe she'll come around. And if she still doesn't trust you, you know  where I'll be."
Giles,Here's something at last.
Xander,Can you please warn us before you do that?
Giles,"There's nothing about Angel in the texts, but it suddenly  occurred to me that it's been ages since I've read the diaries of any of  the watchers before me."
Willow,"(to Buffy) That musta been so embarrassing when you thought he  had read your diary, but then it turned out he hadn't, but then he felt  the same way... (Xander gives her a look) I'm listening."
Giles,"There's mention some two hundred years ago in Ireland of, of  Angelus, the one with the angelic face."
Buffy,They got that right.
Xander,"(clears his throat) I'm not saying anything, I have nothing to  say."
Giles,"Does this, uh, Angel have, um, a tattoo behind his right  shoulder?"
Buffy,"Yeah, it's a, it's a bird or something."
Xander,Now I'm sayin' something. You saw him naked?
Willow,"So, Angel's been around for a while."
Giles,"Not long for a vampire. Uh, two hundred and forty years or so."
Buffy,"Huh! Two hundred and forty. Well, he said he was older."
Giles,"(sits and looks through the diary) Angelus leaves Ireland, uh,  wreaks havoc in, in Europe for, uh, several decades, and then, um, about  eighty years ago, the most curious thing happens. He, he comes to, uh,  to America, um, shuns other vampires, and, and lives alone. There's,  there's no, no record of him hunting here."
Willow,"So he *is* a good vampire! I mean, on a scale of one to ten,  ten being someone who's killing and maiming every night, and one being  someone who's... not."
Giles,"I say that there's no record, but, uh, vampires hunt and kill.  It's, it's what they do."
Xander,"Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly."
Buffy,He could've fed on me. He didn't.
Xander,"Question: a hundred years or so before he came to our shores,  what was he like then?"
Giles,"Uh, like all of them. Uh, a vicious, violent animal."
Darla,"Don't think I'm not grateful, you letting me kill the Three."
Master,How can my children learn if I do everything for them?
Darla,But you've gotta let me take care of the Slayer.
Master,Oh! You're giving me orders now!
Darla,"(walks away) Okay, then, we'll just do nothing while she takes  us out one by one."
Master,"Do I sense a plan, Darla? (she turns around) Share..."
Darla,(walks back) Angel kills her and comes back to the fold.
Master,Angel! He was the most vicious creature I ever met. I miss him.
Darla,So do I.
Master,(considers) Why would he kill her if he feels for her?
Darla,To keep her from killing him.
Master,Hmm. (to Collin) You see how we all work together for the  common good? That's how a family is supposed to function!
Willow,"Okay, so let's review."
Willow,Reconstruction began when? (looks up) Buffy?
Buffy,"Huh? (comes back to earth) Oh! Um, reconstruction... Uh,  reconstruction began after the... construction, which was... shoddy, so  they had to reconstruct."
Willow,After the destruction of the Civil War.
Buffy,"Right. Civil War. During which Angel was already, like, a  hundred and change..."
Willow,"Are we gonna talk about boys, or are we gonna help you pass  history?"
Willow,Sometimes I have this fantasy that Xander's just gonna grab me  and kiss me right on the lips. (huge smile)
Buffy,"You want Xander, you've gotta speak up, girl!"
Willow,"No, no, no, no. No speaking up. That way leads to madness and  sweaty palms."
Willow,"Okay, so here's something I gotta know. When Angel kissed  you... I mean before he turned into... how was it?"
Buffy,(smiles) Unbelievable!
Willow,"Wow! And it is kinda novel how he'll stay young and handsome  forever, although you'll still get wrinkly and die, and... Oh, and what  about the children? (Buffy looks at her) I'll be quiet now."
Buffy,"No, it's okay. I need to hear this. I need to get over him so I  can..."
Willow,So that you can... (makes a stabbing gesture)
Buffy,"Like Xander said, I'm the Slayer, and he's a... vampire. God, I  can't! He's never done anything to hurt me... (collects herself) Okay,  no, I need to stop thinking about this. Okay, let's give another half an  hour and maybe something will sink in. And then I'm going home for some  major moping."
Willow,"Okay. The era of the congressional reconstruction, usually  called radical..."
Joyce,Hello?
Darla,Hi! I'm Darla? A friend of Buffy's?
Joyce,Oh! (exhales) Nice to meet you.
Darla,"(exhales) She didn't mention anything about me coming over for a  study date, did she?"
Joyce,"No, I thought she was studying with Willow at the library."
Darla,"She is. Willow's the Civil War expert, but then I was supposed  to help her with the War of Independence. My family kinda goes back to  those days."
Joyce,"Well, I, I know she's supposed to be home soon. Would you like  to come in and wait?"
Darla,(comes in) It's very nice of you to invite me into your home.  (smiles)
Joyce,You're welcome. I've been wrestling with the IRS all night.  Would you like something to eat? (starts to the kitchen)
Darla,"(follows) Yes, I would!"
Joyce,Let's see what we have. Do you feel like something little or  something big?
Darla,(vamped out) Something big!
Angel,Let her go!
Darla,"I just had a little, there's plenty more. Aren't you hungry for  something warm after all this time? Come on, Angel. Just say 'Yes'!"
Darla,Welcome home!
Buffy,Hey! I'm home.
Buffy,You're not welcome here. You come near us and I'll kill you.
Buffy,"Mom! Mom, can you hear me?! (the operator answers) Yes, I need  an ambulance, 1630 Revello Drive! My mother cut herself, she lost a lot  of blood! Please, please hurry! (drops the phone) Mom!"
Xander,"Hey, Buffy!"
Xander,"Oh, my God!"
Willow,What happened?!
Buffy,Angel!
Buffy,"Do you remember anything, Mom?"
Joyce,"Just, um, your friend came over... I was gonna make a snack..."
Buffy,(misunderstands) My friend?
Joyce,I guess I slipped and cut my neck on... The doctor said it  looked like a barbecue fork. (looks at Buffy) We don't have a barbecue  fork. (looks at Giles) Are you another doctor?
Buffy,"(looks to see) Oh! Um... No, Mom, this is Mr. Giles."
Joyce,"Oh, the librarian from your school! (confused) What's he doing  here?"
Giles,"Uh, I-I just came to pay my respects, wish you a speedy  recovery."
Joyce,"Boy, the teachers really *do* care in this town."
Buffy,Get some rest now.
Buffy,"She's gonna be okay. They, they gave her some iron... Her, uh,  blood count was a, a little..."
Giles,"...a little low. It presents itself like mild anemia. Uh, you,  you were, uh, lucky you got to her as soon as you did."
Buffy,Lucky? Stupid.
Xander,"Buff, it's not your fault."
Buffy,"No? I invited him into my home. Even after I knew who he was,  what he was, and I didn't do anything about it... 'cause I had feelings  for him, because I cared about him."
Willow,If you care about somebody you care about them. You can't  change that by...
Buffy,...killing them? Maybe not. But I think it's a start. (starts to  leave)
Xander,"Uh, we'll keep an eye on your mom."
Giles,(chases after her) Buffy! (blocks her way)
Buffy,You can't stop me. The Three found me near the Bronze and so did  he. He lives nearby.
Giles,"This is no ordinary vampire. (whispers) If there is such a  thing. Now, he knows you, he, he's faced the Three! I think this is  gonna take more than a simple stake."
Buffy,So do I.
Darla,She's out hunting you right now.
Darla,She wants to kill you.
Angel,Leave me alone.
Darla,What did you think? Did you think she would understand? That she  would look at your face... your true face... and give you a kiss?
Darla,For a hundred years you've not (Buffy lowers the bow) had a  moment's peace because you will not (cut to the apartment) accept who  you are. That's all you have to do. Accept it. Don't let her hunt you  down. Don't whimper and mewl like a mangy human. Kill! Feed! Live!
Angel,Alright!
Darla,What do you want?
Angel,I want it finished!
Darla,"That's good. You're hurting me. (smiles) That's good, too."
Joyce,She talks about you all the time.
Joyce,It's important to have teachers who make an impression.
Giles,She makes quite an impression herself.
Joyce,I-I know she's having trouble with history. I-is it too  difficult for her or is she not applying herself?
Giles,"She lives very much in the 'now', um, and, uh, history, of  course, is, is very much about the, uh... the 'then'. B-b-but there's no  reason..."
Joyce,"She's studying with Willow, she's studying with Darla, I-I mean,  she is trying."
Giles,"Darla? I-I-I don't believe I know, uh..."
Joyce,"Her friend, the one who came over tonight."
Giles,Darla came to your house tonight? Sh-she's the friend that you  mentioned earlier?
Joyce,"Poor thing, I must've frightened her half to death when I  fainted. Someone should really check and make sure she's alright."
Giles,"(gets up) Yes, someone should, right away. I'll do it. (grabs  his coat and leaves)"
Joyce,That school is amazing!
Giles,We have a problem.
Buffy,I know you're there. And I know what you are.
Angel,Do you?
Angel,"I'm just an animal, right?"
Buffy,You're not an animal. Animals I like.
Angel,Let's get it done!
Angel,C'mon! Don't go soft on me now!
Angel,Little wide.
Buffy,Why? (gets up) Why didn't you just attack me when you had the  chance? Was it a joke? To make me feel for you and then... I've killed a  lot of vampires. I've never hated one before.
Angel,"Feels good, doesn't it? Feels simple."
Buffy,I invited you into my home and then you attacked my family!
Angel,"Why not? I killed mine. I killed their friends... and their  friend's children... For a hundred years I offered ugly death to  everyone I met, and I did it with a song in my heart."
Buffy,What changed?
Angel,Fed on a girl about your age... beautiful... dumb as a post...  but a favorite among her clan.
Buffy,Her clan?
Angel,Romany. Gypsies. The elders conjured the perfect punishment for  me. They restored my soul.
Buffy,"What, they were all out of boils and blinding torment?"
Angel,"When you become a vampire the demon takes your body, but it  doesn't get your soul. That's gone! No conscience, no remorse... It's an  easy way to live. You have no idea what it's like to have done the  things I've done... and to care. I haven't fed on a living human being  since that day."
Buffy,So you started with my mom?
Angel,I didn't bite her.
Buffy,Then why didn't you say something?
Angel,"But I wanted to. I can walk like a man, but I'm not one. I  wanted to kill you tonight."
Buffy,Go ahead.
Buffy,Not as easy as it looks.
Darla,Sure it is!
Willow,We're near the Bronze. What now?
Giles,Keep looking for her.
Xander,I have a question: what if we find her and she's fighting Angel  and some of his friends? What the heck are we gonna do about it?
Darla,Do you know what the saddest thing in the world is?
Buffy,Bad hair on top of that outfit?
Darla,To love someone who used to love you.
Buffy,(looks at Angel) You guys were involved?
Darla,For several generations.
Buffy,"Well, you been around since Columbus, you are bound to pile up a  few ex's. You're older than him, right? Just between us girls, you are  looking a little worn around the eyes."
Darla,"(smiles) I made him. There was a time when we shared everything,  wasn't there Angelus? You had a chance to come home, to rule with me in  the Master's court for a thousand years, but you threw that away because  of her. You love someone who hates us. You're sick. And you'll always be  sick. And you'll always remember what it was like to watch her die.  (smiles) You don't think I came alone, do you?"
Buffy,I know I didn't.
Darla,"Hmm, scary."
Darla,Scarier!
Darla,"Oh, don't worry. Bullets can't kill vampires. Can hurt them like  hell, but... (giggles)"
Xander,Did you just hear...
Darla,"So many body parts, so few bullets. Let's begin with the  kneecaps. No fun dancing without them."
Darla,"Close, but no heart."
Xander,"We need to distract her, fast!"
Willow,"(calls out) Buffy, it wasn't Angel who attacked your mom, it  was Darla!"
Darla,"C'mon, Buffy. Take it like a man!"
Darla,Angel?
Collin,Forget her.
Master,(looks up angrily) How dare you? She was my favorite. For four  hundred years...
Collin,She was weak. You don't need her. I'll bring you the Slayer.
Master,"(despondently) But to lose her to Angel! He was to have sat at  my right hand, come the day. And now..."
Collin,They're all against you. But soon you shall rise. And when you  do... (puts a hand on the Master's shoulder) ...we kill them all.
Xander,"Ah, the post-fumigation party."
Buffy,"Okay, so what's the difference between this and the pre- fumigation party?"
Xander,Much hardier cockroaches.
Willow,"So, no word from Angel?"
Buffy,"Nah. It's weird, though. In his way I feel like he's still  watching me."
Willow,"Well, in a way he sort of is. In the way of that he's right  over there."
Xander,I don't need to watch because I'm not threatened. Just gonna  look this way.
Lyrics,<I>Did they know what they wanted / The times they kissed me? /  And your hands / I held in mine</I>
Angel,I just wanted to see if you were okay. And your mother.
Buffy,We're both good. You?
Angel,"If I can go a little while without getting shot or stabbed I'll  be alright. Look, this can't..."
Buffy,"...ever be anything. I know. For one thing, you're, like, two  hundred and twenty-four years older than I am."
Angel,I just gotta... I gotta walk away from this.
Buffy,"(nods) I know. Me, too. (whispers) One of us has to go here."
Angel,(whispers) I know.
Lyrics,<I>Your eyes / That always make me shiver / Now they are closed /  They just sometimes twitch a little</I>
Xander,What's going on?
Willow,Nothin'...
Xander,"Well, as long as they're not kissing."
Lyrics,<I>And your body / I could hold for an hour / It sent me to Heaven  / With its heat and power</I>
Buffy,You okay?
Angel,It's just...
Buffy,...painful. I know. See you around?
Lyrics,<I>I'll remember you / You will be there in my heart / I'll  remember you / And that is all that I can do / But I'll remember</I>
