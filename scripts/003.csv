Giles,"(upset) This is madness! What can you have been thinking? You  are the Slayer! Lives depend upon you! (begins pacing) I make allowances  for your youth, but I expect a certain amount of responsibility, and  instead of which you enslave yourself to this, this... (stops pacing)  Cult?"
Buffy,(wearing a cheerleader outfit) You don't like the color?
Giles,"I d... (exasperated) Do you, um... (puts some books on a cart)  Do you ignore everything I say as a, as a rule?"
Buffy,"No, I believe that's your trick."
Buffy,"I told you, I'm trying out for the cheerleading squad!"
Giles,"You have a sacred birthright, Buffy. You were chosen to destroy  vampires, not to... wave pompoms at people. And as the Watcher I forbid  it. (goes back to the table)"
Buffy,And you'll be stopping me how?
Giles,"Well, I... (sits on the edge of the table and crosses his arms)  By appealing to your common sense, if such a creature exists."
Buffy,"I will still have time to fight the forces of evil, okay? I just  wanna have a life, I wanna do something normal. Something safe."
Willow,"Giles didn't approve, huh?"
Buffy,He totally lost his water. We haven't seen a vampire in over a  week. I'd say he should get a girlfriend if he wasn't so old.
Willow,"Well, we're behind you."
Xander,"People scoff at things like school spirit, but look at these  girls giving their all like this!"
Xander,"Ooo, stretchy! Where was I?"
Willow,You were pretending that seeing scantily clad girls in  revealing postures was a spiritual experience.
Xander,"Who said I was pretending? (to Buffy) Oh, hey! Here's a good  luck thing for tryouts. (hands her a bracelet)"
Buffy,What's this?
Willow,What's that?
Buffy,"Oh, how sweet! (reads the inscription) 'Yours Always.'"
Xander,"I-i-it came that way, really, they all said that!"
Willow,(exhales)
Cordelia,"(approaches them) Just look at that Amber. Who does she think  she is, a Laker Girl?"
Willow,I heard she turned them down.
Joy,"Okay, listen up! Let's begin with (checks her clipboard) Amber  Grove. If you're not auditioning, move off the floor."
Willow,(to Amy) Amy! Hi!
Amy,(comes over) Hi!
Willow,I didn't know you wanted to be a cheerleader! You lost a lot of  weight.
Amy,Had to.
Willow,Do you know Buffy?
Amy,Hi.
Buffy,Hi.
Amy,"Oh, how I hate this, let me count the ways."
Amy,(to Buffy) She trained with Benson. He's one of the best coaches  money can buy.
Buffy,They have cheerleading coaches?
Amy,"Oh, yeah! Don't you have? I train with my mom, three hours in the  morning, three at night."
Buffy,"Hmm, that much quality time with my mom would probably lead to  some quality matricide."
Amy,"Oh, I know it's hokey. But she's really great."
Cordelia,Hmm!
Buffy,What the...?
Willow,That girl's on fire!
Cordelia,"(facing away, not seeing the smoke) Enough of the hyperbole!"
Buffy,"(trying to comfort Amber) It's okay, it's okay, you're gonna  be... okay. (to herself) God!"
Buffy,"I've been slaying vampires for more than a year now, and I have  seen some pretty cringeworthy things, but... nobody's hands ever got  toasted before."
Giles,(comes out of the cage) I imagine not.
Buffy,"So, this isn't a vampire problem."
Giles,No.
Buffy,"(turns to Giles) But it is funky, right? Not of the norm?"
Giles,"Quite. Spontaneous human combustion is, is rare, and, and  scientifically unexplainable, but there have been cases for hundreds of  years. Usually all that's left is a pile of ashes."
Willow,That's all that would have been left if it hadn't been for  Buffy.
Xander,"So, we have no idea what caused this. That's a comfort."
Giles,"But that's the thrill of living on the Hellmouth! (sits on the  edge of the table) There's a veritable cornucopia of, of fiends and  devils and, and ghouls to engage. (everyone looks at him) Pardon me for  finding the glass half full."
Buffy,Any common denominators in cases of spontaneous combustion?
Giles,"Uh, rage. In most cases the person who combusted was, was  terribly angry or, or upset."
Xander,"So maybe Amber's got this power to make herself be on fire.  It's like the human torch, only it hurts."
Buffy,I need to get the skinny on Amber. Find out if she's had any  colorful episodes before. (starts to go)
Willow,"That means hacking illegally into the school's computer system.  At last, something *I* can do!"
Xander,I'll ask around about her.
Buffy,You guys don't have to get involved.
Xander,What d'ya mean? We're a team! Aren't we a team?
Willow,"Yeah! You're the Slayer, and we're, like, the Slayerettes!"
Buffy,I just don't like putting you guys in danger.
Xander,"Oh, huh, I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide until it  goes away."
Buffy,"Okay, just walk softly, at least until we know a little more. I  mean, what if Amber isn't causing these problems herself?"
Giles,"Well, then we have to determine who or what did, and, uh, deal  with it accordingly."
Buffy,Hey!
Joyce,"Hi, how was school?"
Buffy,"Mm, a reverent joy. What's all this?"
Joyce,It's for the tribal art display.
Buffy,Cool! (examines a piece) We had tryouts today.
Joyce,"Oh, great! How'd it go? (exhales)"
Buffy,"I didn't actually get to try out. There was an accident. Pretty  fierce competition, though."
Joyce,"Oh, I know you'll do fine. Keep on pluggin', just have to get  back on the horse."
Buffy,Mom?
Joyce,Yeah?
Buffy,What was I trying out for?
Joyce,"Oh, uh... (stops prying at the crate and looks at Buffy) Some  activity? I have no idea, I'm sorry."
Buffy,That's okay. Your platitudes are good for all occasions.
Joyce,"(exhales) I'm distracted. (starts prying again and exhales) Got  a lotta inventory to go through here. (exhales) This is my Gallery's  first major show. (exhales and gives up) You know, it might not  physically kill you to give me a hand here. (goes to check her  clipboard)"
Buffy,It was cheerleading.
Joyce,"Oh good! I'm glad you're taking that up again, it'll keep you  out of trouble."
Buffy,I'm not *in* trouble.
Joyce,"No, not yet."
Joyce,"I mean, you stopped cheerleading just before the trouble, so  it's good you're going back."
Joyce,"Oh, dear."
Buffy,What?
Joyce,"The fertility statue, you don't need to see it."
Buffy,"Y'know, there's this girl, Amy, and, um, she trains with her  mom, like, three hours a day."
Joyce,Uh-huh.
Buffy,Sounds like her mom's pretty into it.
Joyce,Sounds like her mom doesn't have a lot to do.
Buffy,Jeepers!
Joy,(pacing) Despite the terrible thing that happened yesterday we  still have to pick new cheerleaders. If you make the team you'll find  your names posted in the quad after lunch. Let's begin with group  performance.
Amy,(to Buffy) Why do my hands have to sweat when I get nervous?
Buffy,(to Amy) Don't worry. You'll do great.
Joy,"(loudly) Five, six, seven, eight!"
All,Sunnydale! Sunnydale! We never fail! We never fail! Jump and  Shoot! Swish and score! The other team is such a bore! Yeah!
Cordelia,"You saw that, right? That wasn't me! You saw that, right?  (looks at Amy and back again) Right?"
Amy,That's my mom!
Buffy,No! (reads the inscription) Catherine Madison. Get down with  your bad self!
Amy,"Her nickname was 'Catherine the Great'. She took that team and  made them tri-county champions. Y'know, no one's ever done that before,  or since. She and my dad were Homecoming King and Queen. They got  married right after graduation."
Buffy,That's kinda romantic.
Amy,"Well, he was a big loser. Never made any money. Ran off with Miss  Trailer Trash when I was twelve."
Buffy,"Okay, that part's less romantic. My folks split up, too."
Amy,"Drag, huh? Uh, he left my mom with nothing. She put herself  through cosmetology school. (smiles) Bought me everything I ever wanted.  (shakes her head) And never once gained a single pound."
Buffy,"(walks around to face Amy) Uh, she sounds really great, Amy,  but, um... it doesn't mean that you need to lock step as far as this  cheerleading thing."
Amy,She was the best! And I can't get my body to *move* like hers! I  choked in there so bad!
Buffy,"No, Amy, you did fine."
Amy,(dejected) I'm gonna get changed.
Buffy,Wait! No...
Willow,"(walking by) Hey, Amy! (comes over to Buffy) Is she okay?"
Buffy,"No, she's, she's wiggin' about her mom, big cheer queen back  when."
Willow,"Yeah, her mom's kinda..."
Buffy,...Nazi like?
Willow,Heil. If she gains an ounce she padlocks the fridge and won't  eat anything but broth.
Buffy,"So, mommy dearest is really... Mommy Dearest?"
Willow,"There's a bitter streak. But Amy's nice. We used to hang in  Junior High. When her mom would go on a broth kick, Amy'd come over to  my house and we'd stuff ourselves with brownies!"
Buffy,"Hey, any word on Amber?"
Willow,"Nothing thrilling. Average student. Got detention once, for  smoking. Regular smoking... with a cigarette, not, like, being smoky."
Buffy,Hmm.
Willow,All pretty normal.
Buffy,So we just have to wait and we'll see what happens. Maybe  nothing will.
Cordelia,"I have a dream. It's me on the cheerleading squad, adored by  every varsity male as far as the eye can see! We have to achieve our  dreams, Amy. Otherwise we... wither and die!"
Amy,"Look, I'm sorry about..."
Cordelia,"(cuts Amy off) Shhh! If your supreme klutziness out there  today takes me out of the running, you're gonna be so *very* beyond  sorry! (smiles) Have a nice day."
Willow,I told Buffy about Amber.
Xander,"Cool! Was she wearin' it? The bracelet, she was wearin' it,  right? Pretty much like we're goin' out."
Willow,Except without the hugging or kissing or her knowing about it.
Xander,"So I'm just a figure of fun. (exhales) I should ask her out,  right?"
Willow,You won't know till you ask.
Xander,That's why you're so cool! You're like a guy! You're my guy  friend that knows about girl stuff!
Willow,"Oh, great. I'm a guy."
Xander,"Oh, hey, they're posting the list!"
Amy,I can't take this.
Lishanne,Yes!
Xander,"Cover me, I'm goin' in."
Cordelia,(to Amy) You're lucky!
Amy,I made it?
Cordelia,*I* made it!
Xander,"One of those girls hit me really hard! You should test for  steroids. Okay, not only did you make the team, but you, Miss Summers,  are the first alternate, and Amy's number three."
Xander,And what a better way to celebrate than with a romantic drive  through...
Willow,"Xander, alternates are the ones who didn't make the team, they  only fill in if something happens to the ones who did."
Buffy,Excuse me. (goes to console Amy)
Xander,"(downtroden) For I am Xander, King of Cretins. May all lesser  cretins bow before me."
Buffy,"(catches up with Amy) At least it's over. And you know what I  think we should do about it? Brownie pig-out, my house, after school."
Amy,"It's just how many more hours a day can I practice? Y'know, how  much more can I do? This would never happen to my mother. Never."
Amy,Give me the power. Give me the dark.
Amy,"I call on you, the laughing gods."
Amy,Let your blackness crawl beneath my skin.
Amy,Accept thy sacrifice... of Cordelia. Feed on her.
Joyce,"Look what I found. It's my yearbook from junior year. (finds  herself) Oh, look!  There I am."
Buffy,"Mom, I've accepted that you've had sex. I am not ready to know  that you had Farrah hair."
Joyce,This is Gidget hair. Don't they teach you anything in history?
Buffy,"Well, it's really cool, but I gotta book."
Joyce,"Well, I was thinking. I know the cheerleading thing didn't work  out... Maybe you should think about joining the yearbook staff. I did,  it was a lot of fun."
Buffy,"Not really my tip, mom. (opens the refrigerator)"
Joyce,"I was, uh, photo editor. I got to be on every page, made me look  much more popular than I was."
Buffy,And have you seen the kids that do yearbook? Nerds pick on them.  (walks to her bag)
Joyce,(insulted) Some of the best times I had in school were working  on the yearbook!
Buffy,"(faces her mom) Oh, this just in: I'm not you! I'm into my own  thing."
Joyce,"Your own thing, whatever it is, got you kicked out of school,  and we had to move here to find a decent school that would take you!"
Joyce,"Honey, uhhh... (Buffy leaves) (disgusted with herself) Uhhh!  Great parenting form! Little shaky on the dismount."
Xander,"Cordelia, you haven't been mean to me all day. Is it something  I've done? (to Willow) Okay, see how she has no clue that I'm even a  mammal, much less a human being?"
Willow,(takes the pen from her mouth) I see that.
Xander,This is the invisible man syndrome. A blessing in Cordelia's  case. A curse in Buffy's.
Willow,(closes her locker) You're not invisible to Buffy.
Xander,"It's worse! I'm just like a part of the scenery, like an old  shoe. Or a rug that you walk on every day but don't even really see it."
Willow,"(takes her pen out of her mouth) Like a pen that's all chewed  up, and you know you should throw it away, but you don't, not 'cause you  like it so much, more 'cause you're just used to..."
Xander,"Will, yeah, that is the point, you don't have to drive it  through my head like a railroad spike. I'm gonna take your advice and  not beat around the bush."
Willow,Or I could be wrong! Maybe you should beat around the bush  more.
Xander,"Nah, I gotta be a man and ask her out. Y'know, I gotta stop  giving her ID bracelets, uh, subtle innuendoes, taking Polaroids outside  of her bedroom window late at night, that last part is a joke to relieve  the tension because here she comes."
Xander,"Okay, into battle I go. (quickly turns to Willow) Would you ask  her out for me?"
Xander,"No. Man. (lets go of Willow) Me battle. (to Buffy) Buffy! Would  you like to, uh..."
Buffy,(reaches Willow and Xander) Is that even Cordelia's locker?
Xander,"Huh? Oh, I don't know. What I'm saying is accompany me Friday  night..."
Buffy,"(watching Cordelia go and cutting him off) Xander, I have to,  um... (faces him) We can make this up later. You don't mind, do you?"
Cordelia,"(goes around the front of the car) I don't wanna drive today,  Mr. Pole."
Cordelia,"Oh, my God, I, I can't see anything!"
Buffy,"It's, it's okay, it's... (sees Cordelia's eyes) Oh God!"
Cordelia,What's happening? I can't see anything!
Giles,"Witchcraft. Blinding your enemy to disorient and disable them  is, it's classic!"
Xander,"First vampires, now witches. No wonder you can still afford a  house in Sunnydale."
Giles,Why should someone want to harm Cordelia?
Willow,Maybe because they met her? Did I say that?
Giles,And setting Amber ablaze?
Xander,"Yeah, those guys don't hang..."
Buffy,They're both cheerleaders.
Giles,Someone doesn't like cheerleading.
Buffy,Or likes it too much.
Willow,Amy!
Buffy,Amy!
Xander,"So, you guys are leaning towards Amy?"
Buffy,"She's desperate to get on that team, and I've got this feeling  she'd do just about anything to make her mom's dream come true."
Giles,"Uh, let me make sure I have this right. This witch is casting  horrible and disfiguring spells so that she can become a cheerleader?"
Buffy,I think you're underestimating the amount of pressure a parent  can lay on you. If you're not a picture perfect carbon copy they tend to  wig.
Willow,Cheerleading was kind of her mom's last hurrah.
Xander,"Look, we still have to stop Amy. We should grab her and..."
Giles,"(interrupts) I think we should be sure she's the witch before we  arouse her suspicions. She's, she's capable of some fairly unpleasant  things."
Buffy,"Okay, alright, (gets up) so, you're in high school, you are  desperate to make the team and please your mom, so you turn to  witchcraft. What's the first thing you're gonna do?"
Willow,Check out the books on witchcraft!
Xander,"Uh, no! No, that would be the *last* thing you would do! You  don't wanna leave a paper trail. Forget that!"
Willow,It'll just take a minute.
Xander,"We don't have a minute! Cheerleaders are in danger. Buffy's in  danger. (to Buffy) You were the first alternate, you are on the team now  that Cordelia's out. You could be next. We gotta get you to a safe  house."
Willow,Xander...
Xander,Yeah.
Willow,(exhales and reads the monitor) 'Witches: Historic Roots to  Modern Practice.' Checked out by Alexander Harris.
Buffy,"(reads also) 'The Pagan Rites', checked out by Alexander..."
Xander,"Alright, alright, it's not what you think."
Willow,You like to look at the semi-nude engravings?
Xander,"Oh, well, uh, I-I guess it *is* what you think."
Giles,"Have you all quite finished? We have to find a conclusive test.  There may be something in here... (pages through a book) Yes, this  should do it. You'll need some of her hair, a little quicksilver and  some aqua fortis."
Willow,"Well, that's just mercury and nitric acid. You can get that in  the science lab."
Giles,"(reads) 'Heat ingredients and apply to witch, and if a spell has  been cast in the previous 48 hours, witch's skin turns blue.' Hmm.  (shuts the book) Oh, and you'll need some Eye of Newt."
Xander,I can't.
Willow,(drops the eye into the beaker) Eye of Newt!
Xander,How's Buffy doing with the hair?
Lishanne,(to Buffy) Isn't this exciting!
Buffy,"Oh, yeah! (to Amy) Amy, help me. Um, which is the hydrochloric  acid and which is the, uh, ammonium hydroxide?"
Amy,"Well, the bottle that says 'hydrochloric acid' is usually the  hydrochloric acid."
Buffy,Read the bottles. Good concept! (laughs nervously and drops her  pencil) Oops.
Xander,(in a low voice) Wave 'Hi' to the nice little witch!
Willow,All set. (hands the tube to Buffy) Do you have a plan?
Buffy,Spill it on her. Try 'n' make it look natural.
Xander,"We're right behind you, only... further back."
Xander,Did you see? Amy was as freaked out as the rest of us.
Willow,So it's not her?
Buffy,The test was positive! She's our Sabrina. I just don't think she  realizes what she's doing.
Willow,"Well, should we talk to her?"
Buffy,Maybe we should talk to her mother. I wonder if *she* knows what  she's created.
Amy,Where are you?
Amy,Another productive day in front of the TV?
Amy,I got a history report due tomorrow. (drops her bag) Write it!
Amy,(considers) I should be on that team by now. But instead Miss  *Buffy* and friends are sneaking around stealing bits of my hair.
Amy,I'll be upstairs.
Buffy,Oh! Oops! Oh... (sits up) Mm...
Buffy,"Macho, macho, man! I want to be a macho man. Macho... Oh, hey,  juice! (grabs the glass and drinks) Mm... Quality juice. Not from  concentrate!"
Joyce,(glances at Buffy) You're in a good mood.
Buffy,"I am! I'm on the squad, which is great, 'cause I feel like  cheering and leading others to cheer. Ooo, hey, juice!"
Joyce,"Listen, honey, about yesterday, I really..."
Buffy,"Mm! That is totally yester. Besides, it's not like you were  wrong, y'know. I did get kicked outta school. I'm just wacky that way!"
Joyce,"Still, I just want you to know that, despite the problems you've  had, I really..."
Buffy,"(cuts her off) Mom, you just don't get it. And, believe me, you  don't want it. Y'know, there are just some things about being a Vampire  Slayer that the older generation..."
Joyce,A what?
Buffy,It's a... long story.
Joyce,"Buffy, are you feeling well?"
Buffy,"What? Oh, I'm, I'm fine, y'know? What, like, I can't be in a  good mood? Is it, like, a new house rule? Fine, y'know? It's just fine,  fine, fine, 'cause... (sings) I'm a macho, macho man! I want to be a  macho man! (bobs her head) Macho, macho man! (leaves the kitchen) I want  to be a macho man!"
Joy,"(loudly) Five, six, seven, eight!"
Buffy,Turn up the music!
Joy,(yells) Ow! Get it together Buffy! We have a game in less than  four hours!
Buffy,(jumping gleefully) Willow! Xander! My buds are here! I love my  buds! Hi! (notices everyone staring) Hi... Oh...
Xander,"(to Willow) Is it me, or is Buffy a bit looped?"
Willow,We better get her outta there.
Xander,"Yeah, before she..."
Xander,...hurts someone. Ay...
Buffy,Did I do that?
Joy,(pushes Buffy) You are *so* out of here!
Willow,It's not her fault!
Xander,She's on medication.
Buffy,(to Xander) What?
Joy,"Well, obviously not enough. Who's our next alternate? (sees Amy  behind her) Oh. Amy, you just made cheerleader."
Buffy,"No, no, no. You don't want her, she's a wi..."
Xander,A wise choice indeed!
Buffy,She's a witchy!
Willow,Buffy...
Buffy,"I just got kicked off the team, didn't I?"
Xander,I don't think it was your fault.
Buffy,"Hmm, I know you don't, that's 'cause you're my friend. You're my  Xander-shaped friend! (leans her head on his shoulder) Do you have any  idea why I love you so, Xander?"
Willow,We gotta to get her to a...
Xander,(stops Willow with a gesture) Let her speak!
Buffy,I'll tell you! You're not like other boys at all.
Xander,Well...
Buffy,"You are totally, and completely one of the girls! (to Willow)  I'm that comfy with him."
Xander,That's great.
Buffy,"Any other guy who'd give me a bracelet, they'd... wanna date me,  and be like a..."
Buffy,"Oh! I, I don't feel so good."
Willow,Buffy?
Willow,We've gotta get her to a hospital!
Giles,"They can't help her. This is a bloodstone vengeance spell.  (takes her pulse) Hits the body hard like a, a quart of alcohol, and  then it e-eradicates the, uh, immune system."
Xander,"A vengeance spell, like she's trying to get even with Buffy?"
Buffy,'Cause she knows I know she's a witch.
Giles,"The others she just wanted out of the running. You she intends  to, um..."
Buffy,Kill?
Willow,How much time do we have?
Giles,"Oh, uh, I'm sure, uh..."
Buffy,Truth. Please.
Giles,Couple of hours... Three at most.
Xander,"Well, how do we reverse the spell?"
Giles,"(gets up) Well I, I've been researching that, and, uh, we can  reverse all the spells if, um... (takes off his glasses and rubs his  eyes) ...we can just lay our hands on, on Amy's spell book."
Willow,And if we can't get a hold of it?
Giles,"Well, the other way is to cut the witch's head off. (puts his  glasses back on)"
Xander,Show of hands! (raises his hand)
Buffy,It's not Amy's fault. She only became a witch to survive her  mother.
Xander,"(to Buffy) Look, I don't care why, I just care that you go on  breathing."
Buffy,"Giles, where would she be casting these spells?"
Giles,"Oh, she needs a, a sacred space. A-a-a pentagram, um, large pot."
Buffy,Her home. Okay. Help me up.
Buffy,We'll just go to her house and we'll get her book.
Willow,"Okay, we'll go with you."
Buffy,"Uh, no! You guys stay here and keep an eye on Amy."
Giles,(takes Buffy from them) And keep her away from the science lab.  We'll need it to cast our counter-spells.
Catherine,"Who are you? Wha, um, uh, is there something wrong?"
Giles,"Mrs. Madison, we need to talk to you about your daughter."
Catherine,I'm not allow... You'll have to come back later.
Giles,Excuse me!
Catherine,What?!
Giles,"(turns to help Buffy) You alright? (looks for a place to sit her  down) Um, in here. (leads Buffy into the living room) (to Catherine)  Your daughter is meddling with something very dangerous, are you aware  of that? (sits Buffy on the couch)"
Catherine,"Uh, I don't know what you're talking about."
Giles,"Oh, I think you know only too well."
Catherine,"You've got to go. She's gonna be home soon, and you..."
Giles,"(interrupts, indicating Buffy) This girl is very sick. (very  angrily) Now you will shut up and you will listen to me! Your daughter  has access to some very powerful magicks, and somehow your obsession  with cheerleading has made..."
Catherine,"(interrupts, incredulous) I don't care about cheerleading!  It's not my fault she's doing stuff."
Giles,As her mother you should assume some responsibility for her  actions.
Catherine,"(laughs) Well, you know, these kids today! I... (calms down  a bit) She's out of her mind. Ever since dad, her dad... left I can't  control her."
Giles,You're afraid of her?
Buffy,Amy?
Buffy,Are you Amy?
Giles,(looks back at Catherine) I don't understand.
Buffy,"She switched! She switched your bodies, didn't she?"
Giles,(the truth dawns on him) Good Lord!
Buffy,She wanted to relive her glory days.
Catherine,(looks back up) She said I was wasting my youth. So she took  it.
Catherine,"(distraught) I didn't know anything about her powers. I  mean, when dad was here they would fight and yell and he would... call  her a witch and... I mean, I would, just thought he meant... Oh, God,  when he left I wanted to go with him. But she wouldn't even let me call.  She went crazy, I mean, she'd lock herself upstairs for days, and she  was always coming down on me, telling me I didn't deserve to have it so  easy, and that I didn't know... how hard it was to be her, and... I  guess she showed me, huh?"
Buffy,"(takes her hand) Amy, it's gonna be okay."
Catherine,"A few months ago, I woke up in h... her bed! I didn't know  where I was, and... then I looked in the mirror..."
Giles,She locked herself upstairs?
Catherine,Yes.
Giles,Where?
Catherine,(tries to stop him) Don't! If she finds out I've been here  she'll kill me!
Giles,"My God! (exhales) I believe we can reverse your mother's spell.  Well, all of them, in fact. (lets go of the dolls)"
Catherine,"You could? Really, you could?"
Giles,We need to find her books. There'd be specific volumes she'd  need for this kind of casting.
Giles,"Collect those dolls, and, uh, any other personal effects..."
Giles,"Ah! Nice kitty... (calms down) Let's see what you were guarding.  (opens the trunk) Ah, yes! (takes out a book) This is it."
Buffy,Did we find?
Giles,We found. Come on.
Catherine,But where are you going?
Giles,We're going to school.
Giles,And you're coming with us.
Giles,(to Buffy) I'm gonna stop this. I promise.
Giles,You just hang on.
Catherine,(concerned) How is she?
Giles,We only have a few minutes left.
Cheerleaders,"Go, Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go! Go! Six, seven,  eight! Go Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go! Go! Six,  seven, eight! Go Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go! Go!  Six, seven, eight! Go Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go!  Go! (yells from the cheerleaders)"
Giles,Right! Here we go!
Giles,The center is dark. Centrum est obscurus. The darkness breathes.  Tenebrae respiratis. The listener hears. Hear me!
Catherine,"Oh, it's... it's working!"
Giles,Unlock the gate. Let the darkness shine. Cover us with holy  fear.
Giles,Show me...
Joy,"Amy, what's your problem?"
Catherine,She's coming!
Willow,Amy!
Amy,Get out of my way!
Willow,"W-wait! I-I-I need to talk to you, I-I can help you."
Amy,Help me? With what?
Willow,"Uh, well, y'know, all your witchcraft! I, I know this really  good cauldron."
Willow,Do you actually ride a broom?
Willow,Xander!
Giles,Corsheth and Gilail! The gate is closed! Receive the dark!  Release the unworthy! Take of mine energy and be sated!
Giles,Be sated! Release the unworthy!
Giles,Release!
Giles,Release!
Giles,RELEEEEASE!
Amy,Buffy?
Buffy,Amy?
Giles,You... you...
Catherine,You! You little brat!
Amy,(holds the axe threateningly) Mom! Please!
Catherine,How dare you raise your hand to your mother! I gave you  birth. I gave up my life so you could drag that worthless carcass around  and call it living? (swings the axe into a lab table) You've never been  anything but trouble. I'm going to put you where you can't make trouble  again!
Buffy,(jumps up behind Catherine) Guess what?
Buffy,I feel better!
Catherine,That body was mine! Mine!
Buffy,"Oh, grow up!"
Catherine,I shall look upon my enemy!
Catherine,I shall look upon her and the dark place will have her soul!
Catherine,"Corsheth, take her!"
Giles,"Well, that was, um, interesting."
Buffy,You guys okay?
Amy,I'm fine!
Giles,"I assume the, uh, all the spells are reversed. It was my first  casting, so... (inhales) I may have got it wrong."
Buffy,You saved my life! You were a god!
Amy,"Well, I didn't think you'd pull it off."
Xander,I got her! I got her! Cut her head off!
Buffy,"Xander, what are you doing?"
Xander,Saving you?
Buffy,Get your hands off of her.
Xander,But she's evil.
Giles,It wasn't exactly her.
Amy,I was my mom.
Xander,Oh! (releases her)
Willow,Where is she?!
Xander,"Uh, hey Willow! It's cool!"
Willow,It is?
Xander,"Yeah, I took care of it."
Joyce,I don't get it.
Buffy,What?
Joyce,"I've been doing a lot of thinking about... where you're coming  from, how to relate to you... and I've come to a very simple conclusion:  I don't get it."
Buffy,"I'm inscrutable, huh?"
Joyce,"You're sixteen. I think there's a, a biological imperative  whereby I can't understand you because I'm not sixteen."
Buffy,Do you ever wish you could be sixteen again?
Joyce,"Oh, that's a frightful notion. (exhales) Go through all that  again? Not even if it helped me understand you."
Buffy,"I love you, mom."
Joyce,I don't get it!
Amy,"My dad is *so* impossible! He doesn't ever want me going anywhere!  He wants to spend total quantity time together. And I'm, like, 'Dad, I  can go out, it's perfectly safe!' But he's got all this guilt about  leaving me with my mom. And he's being a total pain."
Buffy,You're loving it.
Amy,Every single minute.
Amy,"This Saturday night he wants to stay in and make brownies. Well,  the brownies were my idea."
Cordelia,"(comes up behind them) Hey, I'm really sorry you guys got  bumped back to alternate. (reconsiders) Hold it, wait... No I'm not!"
Amy,"Well, I know that I'll miss the intellectual thrill of spelling  out words with my arms."
Cordelia,"Ooo, these grapes are sour!"
Amy,"(to Buffy) Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot that you wanted to be on the  squad."
Buffy,"Oh, hey, that's okay. Cheerleading's just a little too hairy for  me these days."
Amy,(takes a breath) That's for sure.
Amy,Catherine the Great.
Buffy,And there's been no sign of her?
Amy,That last spell... She said I'd never make trouble again. Wherever  she is I don't think we'll have to worry.
Buffy,Twisted.
Amy,I'm just happy to have my body back. I'm thinking of getting fat.
Buffy,"Y'know, I hear that look's in for spring."
