GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
TRAVERS,"When the Slayer turns 18, it's a time-honored rite of passage."
GILES,It's an archaic exercise in cruelty.
GILES,We're finished.
TRAVERS,"Not quite. She passed, you didn't. I've recommended to the Council you be relieved of your duties as Watcher immediately. You're fired."
WESLEY,The Council's orders are to concentrate-
BUFFY,"I don't think I'm gonna be taking any more orders. Wesley, go back to your Council and tell them, until the next Slayer comes along, I'm not working for them any more."
BUFFY,"What about the key, were they all over it?"
GILES,"Well, they're interested."
BUFFY,"But they didn't guess about Dawn, right? I mean, they don't know that it's her."
BUFFY VOICEOVER,"Here, I'll get that."
BUFFY,"Sorry. Mom's still not a hundred percent, and I guess I haven't really been taking up the slack."
WILLOW,"No, the place looks fine, Buffy."
TARA,"Yeah, it's just us."
XANDER,"That must have belonged to, uh... (We see that Xander's right wrist is in a cast after having been broken in ""Triangle."") Um, aren't we supposed to have a meeting?"
GILES,"Uh, yes, yes, we, we're here for a reason. (Buffy sits) I've had some rather, uh ... well, I've had some news. It seems that the Council of Watchers has ... found some information that may help us out."
BUFFY,About Glory?
GILES,Presumably. We'll find that out when they ... arrive. Could be very important.
BUFFY,Arrive? They're coming here? Now? W-why do they have to come here?
XANDER,"Yeah, don't they have phones? (fake British accent) ""Allo, Buffy, here's some stuff we know, pip pip."""
BUFFY,"Yeah! Phones. See, I'd like them on phones."
TARA,"Well, what's so bad about them coming here? Aren't they good guys? I mean, Watchers, that's just like other Gileses, right?"
BUFFY,"Yeah, they're scary and horrible!"
GILES,"Um, they, well, they can appear a bit ... well, uh, hard-nosed, but, uh, well, essentially, their agenda is the same as ours, they want to save the world and kill demons."
ANYA,"Kill the current demons, right? *Current* demons."
BUFFY,"Giles, I don't want them to come here. I don't trust them. Make them not come here."
GILES,They're probably already on their way. Our old friend Quinton Travers is ... heading up the delegation.
BUFFY,"They put me through that test, and it almost killed me. And then, when I was Faith, they almost killed me again. Honestly, I really can't handle almost being killed right now."
ANYA,I don't like the sound of this. They don't sound very ex-demon-compatible.
TARA,"Are you sure they're English? I-I thought English people were, um, gentler, then, uh, (trailing off) normal..."
WILLOW,"Maybe it won't be so bad this time. I mean, Buffy, they did think you were Faith last time. Now that they know you're just you, maybe they won't care enough to kill you."
BUFFY,"It's not just that. They're gonna screw everything up. I-it's a delicate time right now. I-I have to take care of Dawn, and-"
XANDER,"But that's not new, you've always taken care of her."
BUFFY,"Right. Right, I, I know that, it's just, you know, there's, there's Glory, and..."
BUFFY,(OS) ...and I don't need the Council looking over my shoulder when I don't even know what we're dealing with.
GILES,"(OS) Well, that's precisely why we need to talk to them."
JOYCE,"Dawn, honey, what are you doing up at this hour? Go back to bed."
DAWN,(OS) I was just getting a snack.
BUFFY,"(yelling over her shoulder) Dawn, are you listening?"
DAWN,(calling to Buffy) I can get a snack if I want to.
BUFFY,"(alarmed, to Giles) She was listening."
WILLOW,"Does it matter? I mean, is she really gonna set the junior high school buzzing with ""ooh, there's a delegation a-coming""?"
BUFFY,"No, I, I guess not. You know, it's just ... sometimes we ... say stuff, and, and ... it's all good. Giles, you were saying ... something?"
GILES,"Um, just that ... if the Council knows something about Glory, her agenda or her origins, then ... (sighs) then maybe it will help us get a, a, a grip on what we're dealing with. Right now I think we're, we're a bit lost."
Cut to,"Glory sitting on the floor of her apartment, panting and sweaty, looking pale and in pain. The door bursts open and Dreg enters with another demon who looks like him (Jinx). They are dragging a man in postal carrier uniform."
DREG,"Mistress, at last we've found one."
MAILMAN,"Look, don't hurt me. I beg of you, if you just let me go, I swear I won't tell anyone."
DREG,(to Jinx) Help her!
JINX,"We're here for you, great one."
MAILMAN,What-
DREG,Drink!
MAILMAN,"Oh, what is this? What the, what the hell are you things doing to me?"
DREG,"Very good, delicious."
GLORY,"No, I'm good. It's okay."
MAILMAN,"I know you're all always looking at me. I can tell. Always tell. I can see. I, my hat, where's my hat? (wanders off)"
GLORY,"(groans, laughs) Try not cutting things so close next time, understood?"
DREG,"Yes, we live to serve."
JINX,As always.
GLORY,"Cool. (to Dreg) Take this mess out with the rest of the trash. (Dreg moves away) And you ... (Jinx takes her hand, helps her up) have something to tell me?"
JINX,"Indeed, Glorificus."
GLORY,"(smiling) Well, I'm waiting. (picks up a hand-mirror and rubs lipstick off her teeth)"
JINX,We have found that the signs of the alignment are moving faster than expected.
GLORY,(primping in mirror) Meaning?
JINX,"If you are to use the key, you must act quickly."
GLORY,Fine. (puts mirror down) I have been cooling my heels in this crappy little town long enough. (lies down on bed) Sunnydale's got too many demons and not enough retail outlets. (Picks up a pair of shoes)
JINX,All you need is the key.
GLORY,"(lying on her back) Yes, and I bet Mousy the Vampire Slayer has an idea where it is."
JINX,If I may remind your eminence ... you don't have much time.
GLORY,"(scoffs) Baby, if that girl's the only thing between me and my key? I don't need much time."
GILES,"Well, if you're serious about these matters, all right, but ... you need to be very careful. Measure precisely, and, and, please don't step ahead."
TRAVERS,"(OS) No, he's quite right."
We see Quinton Travers standing there with six other Watchers standing behind him,"four men, two women. Quinton takes one of the books from Giles and looks at it."
TRAVERS,"You wouldn't want to do anything dangerous. Turn the wrong person into a badger. (Smiles, hands the book back)"
GILES,Quinton. I didn't realize you were here. (Gives book to customer; she walks off)
TRAVERS,"Well, evidently."
GILES,"Been a while. I see you've, uh, brought some of our ... colleagues with you. Would you care to introduce us?"
TRAVERS,"Well, first I thought we might catch up."
GILES,"Well, certainly, certainly. Uh, well, um, this is the shop, obviously. (Begins walking toward the counter. Travers follows) Uh, i-it's been a very interesting transition into the world of retail. But I think it's gone rather well. I'll give you the grand tour if you like."
TRAVERS,"No, that's all right, I think I can see what you've been up to."
GILES,"Yes, well, I, I, uh, do limit my time here, obviously."
GILES,"Buffy and I have been training a great deal these days. Uh, there's a, a back room... (points toward the back)"
TRAVERS,(sits on a chair beside the counter) Oh yes. I thought perhaps you were keeping that space for the really dangerous items that should be kept out of the public's hands. (Giles frowns) Or maybe you don't worry about that.
GILES,I'm very careful.
NIGEL,"(comes over holding a vial) Most of this stuff couldn't harm anyone. Incense, dime store trinkets ... but there are some things. (Hands vial to Travers)"
GILES,"I'm sorry, who are you?"
WATCHER2,"There are some very potent elements here ... focusing crystals, runic artifacts, an amulet of Cauldis... Also this statue. (Picks up a statue about 2 feet tall) Its removal from Burma is a criminal offense... (Giles looks surprised. Watcher 2 carries the statue over to Travers) ...and when triggered, it has the power to melt human eyeballs. (She gives the statue to Travers and walks off)"
GILES,"In that case, I severely underpriced it."
TRAVERS,"(nods to Nigel) Uh, Giles, sorry, but this is just for the duration of our stay. I think you can see why."
GILES,"What, what, wha-what is just for the duration?"
NIGEL,"Magic Box shoppers! We're going to have to ask you to leave. The store is, uh, closing early today."
PHILIP,Terribly sorry for the inconvenience.
ANYA,"Hey! Giles, what are they doing? Customers! Please bring your money back."
GILES,You knew you were gonna do this before you even saw the place.
TRAVERS,I'm sorry. It's just for the duration of the Council's review.
ANYA,Council? You're the Council? (smiles) Welcome to our store. We're closed now. I'll be in the back. (Begins walking toward the back)
GILES,"What review, Quinton? Let's just stop a moment and talk about this."
TRAVERS,"(to Anya) Miss, excuse me, you, uh, you work here?"
ANYA,"Yes I do. Ever since I moved here from southeastern Indiana, where I was raised by both a mother and a father."
GILES,"Anya, just go. You don't have to talk to him. (Anya looks relieved, leaves) She works for me. Now tell me about this review. No one said anything to me about this."
TRAVERS,Let's sit down and talk about it over here.
GILES,You all stand around and look somber. (They do. Giles rolls his eyes) Good job.
TRAVERS,"You used to respect us, Giles. You used to be one of us."
GILES,"You used to pay me. If you recall, firing me was not my idea."
TRAVERS,Touche. (sits at table) But you were on the inside once. You know what sort of resources we command.
TRAVERS,"We've discovered information about this creature, your Glory. Some of it is clearly vital, the rest merely extremely disturbing. And it won't be handed over until we're convinced that you and your Slayer are prepared for it. Thus the review."
GILES,"(leans over to put hands on table, speaks softly) I'm not having you put her through another one of your insane tests."
TRAVERS,It's not a test. It's a check of her methods. We need to know that this information is safe.
GILES,You can trust her. (straightens up) Buffy's come very far recently. She's acquired a remarkable focus.
Cut to,"UC Sunnydale classroom. Buffy is sitting among the students, yawning while the professor lectures."
PROFESSOR,"Now, Rasputin was associated with a certain obscure religious sect. (Buffy taps her pencil on her desk. The girl next to her glares. Buffy sees her and stops tapping the pencil but continues fidgeting) They held the tenet that in order to be forgiven, one first had to sin. Rasputin embraced this doctrine and proceeded to sin impressively and repeatedly. The notion that he was in fact evil gained strength years later (Buffy fiddles with her pencil, drops it, shrugs and doesn't pick it up) when the conspirators who set out to kill him found it nearly impossible to do so."
BUFFY,(to herself) Nearly impossible?
PROFESSOR,"I'm sorry, there's a question?"
PROFESSOR,"(sighing) Miss Summers, of course."
BUFFY,"I, uh, about, you know, killing him ... you know, they, they poisoned him and, and they beat him and they shot him, and he didn't die."
PROFESSOR,Until they rolled his body in a carpet and drowned him in a canal.
BUFFY,"But there are reported sightings of him as late as the 1930s, aren't there?"
PROFESSOR,I can assure you there is near consensus in the academic community regarding the death of Rasputin.
BUFFY,"There was also near consensus about Columbus, you know, until someone asked the Vikings what they were up to in the 1400s, and they're like, ""discovering this America-shaped continent."" (Professor looks annoyed) I just ... I'm only saying, you know, it might be interesting, if we .... came at it from, you know, a different perspective, that's all."
PROFESSOR,"Well, I'm sorry if you find these facts so boring, Miss Summers. Maybe you'd prefer I step aside, so that you can teach your own course.  Speculation 101 perhaps? (The other students laugh) Intro to Flights of Fancy? (The students laugh more)"
BUFFY,I only meant-
PROFESSOR,"What was it you were going on about last week? Mysterious sleeping patterns of  the Prussian generals? (Buffy looks annoyed) Now, some of us are here to learn. Believe it or not, we're interested in finding out what actually happened. It's called studying history. You can sit down now. Unless you have something else to add, professor?"
BUFFY VOICEOVER,Miss Summers!
BUFFY,"Some of us are here to learn, professor!"
BUFFY,Maybe you'd like to teach your own class!
VAMP,Who are you talking to?
BUFFY,Spike ... why did you do that?
SPIKE,"Not for money, if that's what you're thinking. Your heartfelt gratitude's plenty. (stops grinning) I expect I'll be getting that any moment."
BUFFY,Gratitude. For getting in my way?
SPIKE,Ge-getting in your way? I saved you.
BUFFY,I was regrouping.
SPIKE,You were about to be regrouped into separate piles. You needed help.
BUFFY,"I didn't need you. I never need you, Spike."
SPIKE,"Oh, I get it. (follows) You just don't like who did the rescuin', that's all. Wishin' I was your boyfriend what's-his-face. Oh wait, he's run off."
BUFFY,"You know what? I don't need a boyfriend, to rescue me or for any other reason."
SPIKE,"Don't need or can't keep? (She stops walking to glare at him) You keep making notches in the headboard but eventually they get up out of the bed and run off, don't they?"
BUFFY,(deeply annoyed) You're disgusting.
SPIKE,"Oh, rough talk. (They resume walking) Maybe that's your problem, maybe you push 'em away. Or is it the other? Maybe you cling too much. Or maybe ... your beauty's fading. (They stop again) The stress of slaying, aging you prematurely. Things not as high, not as firm."
BUFFY,"You know what, Spike? The more I get to know you, the more I wish I didn't."
SPIKE,Or maybe you just don't hold their interest.
Cut to,"interior hospital. Ben comes around a corner, wearing scrubs but putting on his jacket. Jinx comes out of a doorway and grabs him."
JINX,"Begging permission to speak with you, sir."
BEN,"Don't touch me, you're crusty. What do you want?"
JINX,"Oh, not me, the magnificent Glory. She wants. She wants more information on the Slayer, she ... knows you know her."
BEN,"The Slayer? I don't know any Slayer. Get away from me, you shouldn't be here."
JINX,"Oh, I believe you do, sir. She's short, symmetrical, hair on top? Buffy something."
BEN,Buffy Summers is the Slayer?
JINX,"That's the one! Very clever of you, sir."
BEN,The Slayer. How does Glory know this?
JINX,"I do not know, I was not there. But the beauteous Glory said for you to tell us please, where her dwelling is ... who her friends are..."
BEN,"Why? So Glory can find her, do something to her? Why would I do that?"
JINX,"I don't know, sir, she just said to tell you to do it. For her. That was her message."
BEN,"Well, I've got a message for Glory too."
Cut to,"interior magic shop. Giles is walking out of the back room, along with the other Watchers."
GILES,"We've been developing sort of a, a hybrid fighting style ... let me outline her progress for you and I-I think you'll see that your review isn't strictly needed."
BUFFY,"(muttering) Bad day. Bad, baaad...."
TRAVERS,Miss Summers ... (Buffy stops backing away) good to see you again.
BUFFY,Mr. Travers.
TRAVERS,Giles has just been telling us of your training regimen. Perhaps you'll favor us with a demonstration while we're here.
BUFFY,Right now?
TRAVERS,No need to rush you.
GILES,(ruefully) They're ... staying a little longer than I'd anticipated.
TRAVERS,We've already laid out our project for Mr. Giles. Nigel?
NIGEL,"It's an exhaustive examination of your procedures and abilities. We'll observe your training, talk to your friends..."
BUFFY,Talk to my friends?
TRAVERS,"Yes, we understand you're still taking civilians out on patrols."
BUFFY,"Oh, you've gotta be kidding me."
TRAVERS,"Buffy ... I can sense your resistance, and I don't blame you. But I think your Watcher hasn't reminded you lately of the resolute status of the players in our little game. The Council fights evil. The Slayer is the instrument by which we fight. The Council remains, the Slayers change. It's been that way from the beginning,"
GILES,"(scornfully) Well, that's a very comforting, bloodless way of looking at it, isn't it?"
TRAVERS,"Giles, let me talk to Buffy, because I think she's understanding me. (to Buffy) Glory is stronger than you. She's a more powerful instrument, if you will. We can help you. We have information that will help. Pass the review and we give it to you without reservation. Fail the review, either through incompetence, or by resisting our recommendations..."
GILES,"(angrily, moves toward them) Resisting your recommendations? She fails if we don't do whatever you say! How much under your thumb do you think we are?"
TRAVERS,How much do you want our help?
GILES,(pokes his finger angrily at Travers; the other Watchers restrain him) She's not your bloody instrument and you have no right to do any of this!
BUFFY,Giles!
TRAVERS,"I understand you think this is unfair. But there are factors which should motivate you to go along with the review. Now, I don't want to do this, but obviously we could shut this place down permanently."
BUFFY,You can't do that. You don't have that kind of power.
TRAVERS,"Of course we do, and a great deal more. In fact, if you insist on fighting us, we'll arrange to have Mr. Giles deported within the day. Never set foot in this country again. Now perhaps you're used to idle threats and sloppy discipline, Miss Summers, but you're dealing with grownups now. (pause) Am I making myself clear?"
GLORY,"Jinx... hey, what's the deal with your face?"
JINX,It's a message from Ben. He ... isn't going to help.
GLORY,(pouring oil into her hand) Isn't go... (bemused) isn't going to help?
JINX,No.
GLORY,All he has to do is turn over that tiny squirming Slayer girl! (rubbing oil on her arms) I have business to do with her. If she knows where I can start looking for my key... aah!
GLORY,Why won't he help? He knows her. He could go to her ... he could talk to her ... (irritated) he could seduce her and bang the key out of her!
JINX,He is quite attractive.
GLORY,"Well, of course he's attractive! (pouty) But he drives me insane. Know what I mean?"
JINX,He drives you insane?
GLORY,Yeah! That's it exactly! (puts her head on Jinx's chest) Oh. Sweet lumpy minion. You're the only one that understands. (thoughtfully) Probably cause I haven't sucked your brain out yet. (Jinx cringes) He makes me so mad... if I could just ... get my hands on him...
GLORY,(drops her hands) You know? (Walks away. Jinx sighs in relief) I'll just find her myself.
GILES,"It's a power play, that's what it is. It's about who has the power."
BUFFY,I'm guessing they do? Big power outage in Buffy county?
GILES,"I should have set you loose on them, that's what I should have done."
BUFFY,"Giles, that Travers guy is like sixty. I can't hit him. (looks up) Can I?"
GILES,"I suppose not. Well, I could. I think I will."
BUFFY,Can they really do the stuff they threatened? Kick you out the country?
GILES,"In a heartbeat. (Takes off his glasses, takes out a handkerchief and begins cleaning his glasses) See, the rough stuff, they're all right out there, a bit ham-handed, but they get it done, but, uh ... this stuff, the, uh, bureaucracy, the pulling of political strings, they're the best in the world. They can kill you with the stroke of a pen. Poncy sods."
BUFFY,(softly) Am I gonna be able to get through this review?
GILES,"Well, I..... (comes over and sits next to her)  I suppose they'll make it as difficult as they want to. The physical stuff could be a bit of a challenge. (Puts on his glasses, immediately takes them off again)"
BUFFY,"That's not what I'm worried about. It's the other stuff. Examining decisions I've made. I mean, twice now I've been within slaying distance of Glory, and twice she's kicked my ass without even tensing a muscle. And I haven't been able to figure out ... what she is, or anything about her except that she wants the key, which I have, and I can't even figure out if it's okay for me to tell anyone that."
GILES,"Buffy, no one could have done any better than you."
BUFFY,"But no one else is gonna be asked the questions that I can't answer. (getting agitated) They're gonna expect me to ... to be like a Slayer and, and know stuff, but I'm just me and I don't know anything, and they're gonna go away, and they're not gonna tell me how to fight Glory, and I'm not gonna be able to protect Dawn."
GILES,"Buffy, calm down. The scandal here is not anything you've done wrong, it's the way they're behaving. Holding what they know hostage with a gun pointed at my bleeding green card, no less. (sighs)  It's humiliating."
BUFFY,Also smart. They picked the perfect thing. I can't lose you.
GILES,(softly) Thank you.
BUFFY,"(sighs) I guess I should be getting ready. What do you think it'll be like, I mean, how do you think they'll start?"
Cut to,Anya sitting next to Xander in Xander's apartment.
ANYA,"Anya Christina Emanuella Jenkins, twenty years old. Born on the fourth of July, and don't think there weren't jokes about that my whole life, mister, 'cause there were. ""Who's our little patriot?"" they'd say, when I was younger, and therefore smaller and shorter than I am now."
PHILIP,"(taking notes) So, you spell it A-N-Y-A, yes?"
ANYA,Yes.
PHILIP,"Fine, now we can get to the questions."
Cut to,Willow and Tara's room. Willow and Tara sit on the bed side-by-side. Nigel stands before them with a notebook.
WILLOW,"Questions, great."
TARA,"Well, we can answer questions."
NIGEL,"Good. I need to know a little bit more about the Slayer, and about the both of you. Your relationship, whatever you can tell me."
TARA,O-o-our relationship?
WILLOW,We're friends.
TARA,Good friends.
WILLOW,"Girlfriends, actually."
TARA,"Yes, we're girlfriends."
WILLOW,"We're in love. We're ... lovers. (puts hand on Tara's knee) We're lesbian, gay-type lovers."
NIGEL,I meant your relationship with the Slayer.
TARA,"Um, just good friends."
XANDER,"*Best* friends. Willow and me and Buffy. The three of us have been together from the beginning. We've always gone on patrols, and uh, done demon research with her and everything."
PHILIP,Have you mastered any fighting disciplines over the years?
XANDER,No.
PHILIP,"So, you have no special skills, or powers, or knowledge that you bring to the mix. Neither of you."
ANYA,Just enthusiasm for killing the demons. Go deadness for the demons.
XANDER,"I don't have any powers, but I do help."
PHILIP,How? Be specific.
XANDER,"Last year, uh, Willow, Giles and me combined our essences with Buffy, which isn't as weird as it sounds. (laughs nervously) We merged, and I was the heart part of a super-Buffy. Again, let me stress the not-as-weird thing."
ANYA,I'm told it was all very professional.
NIGEL VOICEOVER,Are you saying that the Slayer needs that level of help from you often?
WILLOW,"No, no, she doesn't need help."
TARA,She'd be fine without us. Sometimes she goes off and does stuff without even telling us.
WILLOW,"Not that she's like a, a weird loner or anything."
TARA,I'm not sure we're saying this right.
WILLOW,"See, here's the thing. We, we can help because we do magicks. I'm working on this ball of sunshine thing. See, I have this theory."
TARA,It's very cool.
WILLOW,"A-and if it works, easier slaying for Buffy. Not that it's hard for her now!"
NIGEL,Interesting. What level are you at?
TARA,Level?
NIGEL,Magical proficiency level?
WILLOW,"Oh! Uh, high, a high level. Very high. One of those ... top levels."
TARA,Five!
NIGEL,And you're registered as practicing witches under the names as you gave them to me?
TARA,R-registered?
WILLOW,"Oh yes! Yes, of course we're-"
TARA,...r-r-registered. (nodding)
PHILIP,Do either of you know anything about the key?
ANYA,"Nope, but it sounds demony to me. I don't hold with that demon nonsense. (picks up a basket of muffins and holds it toward Philip) Muffin? I cooked them myself."
PHILIP,"(gestures to indicate ""no thanks"") So, Buffy sometimes protects you from the dangerous elements of her work."
XANDER,Yes. She's saved my life lots of times. The vampires in this town hate her.
Cut to,Spike's crypt. Spike staring at someone.
WATCHER #2,(OS) But we understand that you *help* the Slayer.
SPIKE,I pitch in when she pays me.
WATCHER2,She pays you? She gives you money?
SPIKE,"Money, a little nip of blood out of some stray victim, whatever."
WATCHER2,Blood?
SPIKE,"Well, if they're gonna die anyway. (considers) Come to think of it, though, that's a bit scandalous, isn't it? Personally, I'm shocked. The girl's slipping."
WATCHER2,You've noticed a decline in her work?
SPIKE,"Oh, yeah. See, the poor little twig can't keep a man. Gets her all down. Few more disappointments, she'll be cryin' on my shoulder, mark my words."
WATCHER2,(frowns) Is that what you want? I'd think you'd want to kill her. You've killed Slayers before.
SPIKE,"(intrigued) Heard of me, have you?"
WATCHER2,(embarrassed smile) I ... wrote my thesis on you.
SPIKE,"(grins) Well, well. Isn't that neat. (stops smiling) Tell me, pet, now we're such good friends, how's the Slayer doing? Is she okay? High marks in all categories?"
TRAVERS VOICEOVER,"Agility, clarity, stamina and strength-"
TRAVERS,...these are the qualities that the Slayer must possess to do her job.
BUFFY,What came after agility?
GILES,If you want her to attack the dummy-
TRAVERS,"No, no. Philip will attack the dummy. (We see Philip standing next to the dummy, wearing a karate robe) The Slayer's job is to protect it. Do you understand?"
BUFFY,Protect the dummy.
TRAVERS,"As if it were precious. Now, getting the best of Philip will require agility. Listening to my instructions at the same time, that will demonstrate clarity. And stamina and strength will win the long fight. Good luck."
BUFFY,Instructions?
TRAVERS,"Yeah, I'll be telling you what to do, how to counter Philip's attack. We assume you're familiar with the Japanese names for aikido and jiu-jitsu moves."
BUFFY,Japanese?
WATCHER2,"(clicking a stopwatch) And, go!"
BUFFY,"Whoa, hold on a second. We uh, you know in America, we usually just work our way up to ""go."""
TRAVERS,(speaks Japanese)
BUFFY,Huh?
GILES,He wants you to bow. Take a bow.
BUFFY,Oh. (bows)
TRAVERS,(Japanese)
GILES,Punch him.
BUFFY,"Thanks, Giles."
GILES,Sorry.
TRAVERS,(Japanese)
GILES,"Uh...back kick, elbow-"
GILES,...elbow...strike.
TRAVERS,How have you been training her?
GILES,I've trained her to win.
BUFFY,"You know what? I'm gonna have to do it my way, guys."
BUFFY,Uh-oh.
PHILIP,I think she just broke my rib.
TRAVERS,"Yes, well."
BUFFY,"I didn't mean to. Um, you know, I, I can do better. I think I might be getting this, like, inner ear thing, and so maybe, maybe if I got a note, I, I could try again."
TRAVERS,"No, that's all right, I don't think we need to see any more physical tests for a while. We can move on to the real review. Look into your strategies, plans ... figure out what's going on in that head."
BUFFY,(unhappily) Good. Head stuff.
TRAVERS,"We start at seven tonight. Give you time to, uh ... (looks from Buffy to Giles) well, however you prepare."
Cut to,Buffy entering the Summers home.
BUFFY,"(puts down her bag, calling) Mom?"
GLORY,"Long day, sweetie?"
GLORY,"So ... this is where the Slayer eats, sleeps, and (runs her finger through the dust on a side table) ...combs her hair? Oh... (picks up a photo) so cute. (Holds it up for Buffy to see, then puts it down) I can't even stand it. Personally? I need more space, but uh, this is good for you, it's, it's so quaint, and..."
GLORY,"Buffy... (takes the poker) If I wanted to fight, you could tell by the being dead already. (goes to sit in an armchair, giggles) So play nice, little girl."
BUFFY,What do you want?
GLORY,"The key. Why else do you think I'd come here? See, (points poker at Buffy) I think you knew where it is. And that's a good thing."
BUFFY,I'm glad you think so.
GLORY,"Well, it's the only thing keeping you alive right now. Because you may be tiny queen in vampire world..."
GLORY,"...but to me, you're a bug. You should get down on your knees and worship me!"
GLORY,"But oh, no, you still think it's neat having Slayer strength. (Dawn mouths ""What?"" at Buffy) Ooh, big deal! Stronger than humans! (Dawn begins to back away) Who isn't? I could crush the life from you as easy as you'd break a nail. But I need the key."
GLORY,Kid!
GLORY,Come here a sec.
BUFFY,Leave her out of this.
GLORY,Not asking twice.
BUFFY,This is between you and me.
GLORY,No. This is between me and my key. You just happen to be the thing in the way.
GLORY,"And you are just the darlin'-est thing I ever did see in my life. What's your name, honey?"
DAWN,Dawn.
GLORY,"Dawn? Did you know your sister took my key, Dawnie? And she won't give it back! I bet you know where she put it, don't you?"
BUFFY,She doesn't know anything.
DAWN,"(looks at Buffy, annoyed) I know some stuff."
GLORY,"I bet she takes your stuff all the time without asking, doesn't she? Where's my key, Dawn?"
BUFFY,"Go upstairs, Dawn."
DAWN,"(angrily, to Buffy) You're always talking about stuff I'm not supposed to hear. (Glory looks interested) I'm gonna figure it out, you know."
GLORY,"(grins) Ooh, I like her. She's sassy. (pauses, gets serious) And I'll kill her. I'll kill your mom, I'll kill your friends ... and I'll make you watch when I do. (sighs) Just give me the key. You either have it or you know where to find it. (stands up) Obviously, this is a one-time-only deal. Next time we meet, something you love dies bloody. You know you can't take me. You know you can't stop me."
JOYCE,"Buffy, who was that?"
BUFFY,Pack a bag.
SPIKE,"(sarcastically) Oh, it's the Slayer. For a second there I was worried."
SPIKE,"(surprised) So, what's with the family outing?"
BUFFY,"(quietly, walking up close to him) I need your help."
SPIKE,Great. I need your cash.
BUFFY,I'm serious. (even more quietly) You have to look after them.
SPIKE,"Well, that's a boatload of manly responsibility to come flying out of nowhere. What's the matter, Slayer? You're not feeling a hundred percent?"
BUFFY,(frowns) No.
SPIKE,"(frowns) They didn't put a chip in your head, did they?"
BUFFY,No!
SPIKE,Be funny if they did.
BUFFY,"(annoyed) Spike, I need an answer. Now. In or out? (quietly) You're the only one strong enough to protect them."
SPIKE,(looks at her for a moment) All right then. (calls to Joyce and Dawn) Ladies... (walks toward them; Buffy follows) Come on in. There's plenty of blood in the fridge.
DAWN,"Do you mean like, real blood?"
SPIKE,What do you think?
DAWN,"Mostly I think ""ew."""
BUFFY,(to Joyce) Keep Dawn here as long as you can. I'll be back soon.
JOYCE,Okay.
BUFFY,"(walks over to Spike) I don't think I need to remind you, but-"
SPIKE,"Yeah, yeah, ""anything happens to 'em I'll stake you good and proper."" Sing me a new one sometime, eh? That bit's gone stale."
JOYCE,"I, I love what you've, um, neglected to do with the place."
SPIKE,Just don't break anything. (goes to turn on the TV) And don't make a lot of noise. <I>Passions</I> is coming on.
JOYCE,"(comes forward) <I>Passions</I>? Oh, do you think Timmy's really dead?"
SPIKE,"Oh! (gestures to his armchair. He and Joyce each sit on one arm) No, no, she can just sew him back together. He's a doll, for god's sake."
JOYCE,"Uh, what about the wedding? I mean, there's no way they're gonna go through with that."
XANDER,Look at them. Big tough Council members pickin' on the books.
WILLOW,Fascists.
TARA,Why doesn't Mr. Giles put them all out of here?
XANDER,"Because if they deport him, they're not just destroying his career, they're ... condemning the man to a lifetime diet of blood sausage, bangers, and mash."
TRAVERS,"Well, your Slayer's twenty minutes late and counting, Rupert."
GILES,"Buffy will be here, I assure you."
TRAVERS,"(chuckles) Yes, but when?"
Cut to,Buffy walking through a dark alley. She looks at her watch.
BUFFY,Crap.
BUFFY,Uh ... guys? A-any way we could ... not do this?
BUFFY,Okay. Let's see what you are.
BUFFY,Or who you are.
KNIGHT,One soldier in a vast army.
BUFFY,What army?
KNIGHT,"The Knights of Byzantium, an ancient order. And now your enemy."
BUFFY,(pushes the staff harder into his throat) You work for Glory?
KNIGHT,You think we align ourselves with the beast? You must be mad.
BUFFY,You're the ones tried killing me.
KNIGHT,"No, we were fools, three alone. But if it takes a hundred men, we send a hundred men, and if it takes a thousand, we send a thousand."
BUFFY,A thousand?
KNIGHT,"So long as you protect the key, the brotherhood will never stop until we destroy it and you. You are the Slayer, and we know what we must do. Now, be done with it. Kill us, and let legions follow."
BUFFY,Go.
Cut to,"Buffy entering the magic shop, still holding the sword. Pan across all the Watchers standing there, the four Slayerettes still sitting on the upper level, and Travers sitting at the table with a pile of papers spread out in front of him. Giles sits on the stairs leading up to the balcony."
TRAVERS,You're late.
BUFFY,Yeah.
GILES,"(sees the sword, gets up) Was, was there an attack?"
BUFFY,Yeah.
TRAVERS,"We can begin the review at last. We'll, uh, skip the more obvious questions..."
BUFFY,There isn't gonna be a review.
TRAVERS,Sorry?
BUFFY,"No review. No interrogation. No questions you *know* I can't answer. No hoops, no jumps - (Nigel starts to speak) and no interruptions."
BUFFY,See ... I've had a lot of people talking at me the last few days. Everyone just lining up to tell me how unimportant I am. And I've finally figured out why. (looks Travers in the eye) Power. I have it. They don't. This bothers them.
BUFFY,Glory ... came to my home today.
GILES,"(alarmed) Buffy, are you-"
BUFFY,"(puts her coat on a chair) Just to talk. (resumes pacing) She told me I'm a bug, I'm a flea, she could squash me in a second. (stops, looks at Travers again) Only she didn't. She came into my home, and we talked. We had what in her warped brain probably passes for a civilized conversation. Why? (pauses) Because she needs something from me. Because I have power over her."
BUFFY,"You guys didn't come all the way from England to determine whether or not I was good enough to be let back in. You came to beg me to let you back in. To give your jobs, your lives some semblance of meaning."
NIGEL,This is beyond insolence-
BUFFY,(clears throat) I'm fairly certain I said no interruptions.
XANDER,(whispers) That was excellent!
BUFFY,"You're Watchers. Without a Slayer, you're pretty much just watchin' <I>Masterpiece Theater</I>. You can't stop Glory. You can't do anything with the information you have except maybe publish it in the ""Everyone Thinks We're Insane-O's Home Journal."" (Pauses, addresses Travers again) So here's how it's gonna work. You're gonna tell me everything you know. Then you're gonna go away. (resumes pacing) You'll contact me if and when you have any further information about Glory.  The magic shop will remain open. Mr. Giles will stay here as my official Watcher, reinstated at full salary..."
GILES,(coughing) Retroactive.
BUFFY,...to be paid retroactively from the month he was fired. I will continue my work with the help of my friends...
WATCHER2,"I, uh, I ... don't want a sword thrown at me, but, but, civilians, I - we're talking about children."
BUFFY,(looks up at her friends on the balcony) We're talking about two very powerful witches and a thousand-year-old ex-demon.
ANYA,Willow's a demon?!
PHILIP,The boy? No power there.
BUFFY,The boy has clocked more field time than all of you combined. He's part of the unit.
WILLOW,(whispers to Xander) That's Riley-speak.
XANDER,"(whispers back, with a big grin) I've clocked field time."
BUFFY,"Now. (addresses the Watchers) You all may be very good at your jobs. The only way we're gonna find out is if you work with me. You can all take your time thinking about that. (turns back to Travers) But I want an answer right now from Quinton, 'cause I think he's understanding me."
TRAVERS,"(clears throat) Uh, your terms are acceptable."
BUFFY,See? No biggie.
TRAVERS,"(nods) Uh, Rupert."
GILES,Quinton?
TRAVERS,"When we inventoried your shop, we found a bottle of single malt scotch behind the, uh, incense holders."
GILES,"Well, it's, it's not, you know, during working hours."
TRAVERS,I think I could use a glass.
GILES,"Well, I suppose we could- (starts to move away)"
BUFFY,(gets up) Just a minute. (Giles stops) Glory. I wanna know.
TRAVERS,"Well, there's a lot to go through."
BUFFY,Just tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
TRAVERS,"Well, that's the thing, you see. Glory isn't a demon."
BUFFY,What is she?
TRAVERS,She's a god.
BUFFY,"(long pause, eyes widen) Oh."
