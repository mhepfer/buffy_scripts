<blockquote>Note,"""Previously on Buffy"" was not shown at the beginning of this episode."
BUFFY,"(calling) Hey, Mom."
BUFFY,Ooh.
"She opens the card that came with the flowers. Shot of the card, which reads","""Thank you for a _lovely_ evening. See you soon? Brian."""
BUFFY,(to herself) Still a couple of guys gettin' it right.
BUFFY,(calls) Hey. Flower-gettin' lady. Want me to pick Dawn up from school?
BUFFY,Mom?
BUFFY,What are you doing?
BUFFY,(quieter) Mom? (even quieter) Mom? (very quietly) Mommy?
<b>NOTE,There is no background music at all in this episode.</b>
JOYCE,I think we're just about ready for pie. (She and Buffy begin clearing dishes)
XANDER,Then I'll be pretty much ready for barf.
BUFFY,Xander!
XANDER,"No, no, (to Joyce) barf from the eating. 'Cause all was good, and too much goodness..."
JOYCE,I'm taking it as a compliment.
GILES,"Yes, uh, everything was delicious. (stands to help clear)"
ANYA,"Yes, I'm going to barf too."
JOYCE,(sarcastic) Everyone's so sweet.
XANDER,"How you doing there, Will, are you in the vomit club too?"
WILLOW,(groaning) I had too much nog.
TARA,"(sympathetic) Oh, baby, want me to rub your tummy? (to the others) She likes it when I ... (pauses, quietly) stop explaining things."
DAWN,My nog tastes funny. I think I got one with rum in it.
WILLOW,That's bad.
XANDER,"Yeah, now Santa's gonna pass you right by, naughty booze hound."
WILLOW,Santa always passes me by. Something puts him off. Could be the big honkin' menorah.
TARA,"(to Dawn) Oh, did you write him a letter?"
XANDER,What'd you ask for?
DAWN,"Um, guys, hello, puberty? Sorta figured out the whole no Santa thing."
ANYA,That's a myth.
DAWN,Yeah.
ANYA,"No, I mean, it's a myth that it's a myth. There is a Santa Claus."
XANDER,The advantage of having a thousand-year-old girlfriend. (turns to Anya) Inside scoop.
TARA,There's a Santa Claus?
ANYA,"Mm-hmm. Been around since, like, the 1500s. He wasn't always called Santa, but you know, Christmas night, flying reindeer, coming down the chimney -- all true."
DAWN,(smiles hopefully) All true?
ANYA,"Well, he doesn't traditionally bring presents so much as, you know, disemboweled children, but otherwise..."
TARA,The reindeer part was nice.
JOYCE,Damn it! I hate this oven. It burnt.
BUFFY,"Oh, no, it's just blackened, you know, it's, it's Cajun pie."
GILES,(to Joyce) Shall I open another?
JOYCE,"Oh, do you think we dare?"
BUFFY,"As long as you two stay away from the band candy, I'm cool with anything."
JOYCE,(quietly to Buffy) You are a demon child.
BUFFY,"I live to torment you, is that so wrong?"
JOYCE,"A daughter's duty, I suppose. (kisses Buffy on the forehead)"
BUFFY,"Look, all we have to do is just cut off a little bit of the burnt..."
BUFFY,Mom! Mom! Mom Mom Mom-
911 OPERATOR,911 emergency.
BUFFY,Hello?
911 OPERATOR,Do you have...
BUFFY,"My mom, she, she's not breathing."
911 OPERATOR,Is she conscious?
BUFFY,"(moving back into living room) No. I-I-I can't, she, she's not breathing."
911 OPERATOR,"OK, I need you to give me your address."
BUFFY,What?
911 OPERATOR,I'm gonna send an ambulance over.
BUFFY,"Si-Sixteen thirty Rivelo, it-it's a house, Rivelo near Hadley."
911 OPERATOR,I'm sending a unit right away. Are you alone in the house?
BUFFY,Yes.
911 OPERATOR,"Well, did you see what happened, did she fall?"
BUFFY,"No, no, I-I came home and she-what should I do?"
911 OPERATOR,Do you know how to administer CPR?
BUFFY,"(upset) No, I don't remember."
911 OPERATOR,"Okay, it's very simple. You wanna tilt your mother's head back. Cover her mouth with yours, and breathe into her mouth."
BUFFY,I know this. I know this. God.
BUFFY,I can do this. Okay. Okay.
BUFFY,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight..."
BUFFY,"One, two, three... (We hear a cracking noise) Oh! Oh god."
BUFFY,"I, are you there? I, I broke something."
911 OPERATOR,Hello?
BUFFY,It cracked.
911 OPERATOR,Is she breathing?
BUFFY,No.
911 OPERATOR,Paramedics should be there in a moment. You might have cracked a rib. It's not important.
BUFFY,(putting her hand on Joyce's) She's cold.
911 OPERATOR,The body's cold?
BUFFY,"No, my mom! Sh-should I make her warm?"
911 OPERATOR,"No ... if she's not responding to CPR, the best thing is to wait for the paramedics, okay?"
BUFFY,(angry) When will they be here?
911 OPERATOR,They're very nearby.
BUFFY,(very quietly) I have to make a call.
GILES,(on phone) Hello?
BUFFY,(softly) Giles. You have to come.
GILES,(on phone) Buffy?
BUFFY,She's at the house.
BUFFY,She's in here.
PARAMEDIC 1,I'm getting no pulse.
PARAMEDIC 2,Let's lay her out.
PARAMEDIC 2,(to Buffy) How long's she been like this?
BUFFY,"I found her, a-a few, few minutes."
PARAMEDIC 2,Was she conscious?
BUFFY,No.
PARAMEDIC 1,I'm bagging her.
BUFFY,What?
PARAMEDIC 2,"We're gonna intubate. Just trying to get her to breathe, all right?"
PARAMEDIC 2,This your mother?
BUFFY,Yes.
PARAMEDIC 2,"She have any serious physical health problems, any history of heart disease?"
BUFFY,No.
BUFFY,"I mean, there, there was a tumor, (Paramedic 1 inserting a tube in Joyce's mouth) a brain tumor, but she had an operation and she's fine now. She, she's been fine."
PARAMEDIC 1,"I got her! My god, we got her!"
PARAMEDIC 2,Let's get her on the truck now. I'm calling ahead.
PARAMEDIC 1,(faintly in background) Never brought one back this stiff.
JOYCE,Buffy.
BUFFY,I'm here.
PARAMEDIC 1,"It's a miracle. That's what it is, a beautiful miracle."
DOCTOR,Good as new.
JOYCE,"Buffy, thank god you found me in ti-"
PARAMEDIC 2,"She's cold, man."
PARAMEDIC 2,Call it.
PARAMEDIC 2,I'm sorry.
BUFFY,(OS) Wha-what do we do now?
PARAMEDIC 2,"I'm sorry, but I have to tell you that..."
PARAMEDIC 2,(OS) ...your mother's dead.
PARAMEDIC 2,It looks like she did die a good while before you found her. There's .. nothing you could have done.
BUFFY,W-what...
PARAMEDIC 2,I'm guessing it must have been a aneurysm or some clotting. Some complication from surgery. She probably felt...
PARAMEDIC 2,"...very little pain. I'm gonna call it in. The coroner's office will come by and take her in, and they'll determine the cause of death conclusively."
RADIO,"Dispatch 7, we have a 206, what's your status?"
PARAMEDIC 1,We're moving.
RADIO,"Location is Beaumont and 9th, your gig is on the street, go now."
PARAMEDIC 1,Okay. We gotta fly.
PARAMEDIC 2,All right. (to Buffy) I'm gonna call this right away.
PARAMEDIC 2,"Now the coroner's office may take a while. In the meanwhile, I think you should sit. Have a glass of water, and try not to disturb the body."
PARAMEDIC 2,"Do you need anything, is there someone you can call?"
BUFFY,(softly) Someone's coming.
PARAMEDIC 1,Let's go.
PARAMEDIC 2,I'm very sorry for your loss.
BUFFY,Thank you.
BUFFY,Good luck.
GILES,(OS) Buffy!
GILES,What is it? Is it Glory?
BUFFY,"(stands) I'm waiting. The, the coroner's coming."
GILES,What? (takes a few steps inside)
BUFFY,"(looks down, thinking) I have to tell Dawn. She's at school. (looks up) I'll go there."
GILES,I'm not sure...
GILES,Oh god.
BUFFY,"No. No. Don't. No, it's too late."
GILES,(OS) Joyce?
BUFFY,"They're, they're coming for her, no, no, we're-"
GILES,Joyce!
BUFFY,(desperate) We're not supposed to move the body!
Cut to,"Dawn leaning against a wall, crying."
DAWN,"Oh, god. I can't believe it."
GIRL,(OS) It's not that bad.
DAWN,(disbelieving) How can you say it's not that bad?
DAWN,"Kevin Berman called me a freak in front of everybody. (shrugs) No, that's no big deal."
LISA,He didn't say you were a freak.
DAWN,Forget it.
LISA,"He just said you were ... freaky. Which, you know, freaky can be ... sort of cool."
DAWN,Oh yeah. Real cool. (teary) I'm a suicidal head-case.
LISA,"You know it was Kirsty. She was telling people how you were into cutting yourself, and how you-"
DAWN,That's such a lie! I got cut. By accident. One time.
DAWN,Now Kevin thinks I'm a-
LISA,"Well, that was when you were wigging out about your family, and of course Kirsty's gotta turn everything into a story."
LISA,She was telling people that you were adopted.
DAWN,"What a prima bee-yotch. I swear, if I could make her head explode using only the power of my mind? That's what I'd be doing right about now."
DAWN,(teary) Great. Now I look like a wet rat.
LISA,"Yeah, you know you can't go out there looking all cry-faced. That'll just give Kirsty more ammo."
DAWN,"You know? My big sister could really beat the crap out of her. (Lisa nods) I mean, really really. (Blows her nose) Okay. What do you think? (Turns to face Lisa) Can I show my face?"
LISA,You're good to go. We're gonna be late anyway.
Cut to,"the two girls coming out of the bathroom, backpacks on their shoulders. Shot of a typical school hallway full of kids."
LISA,Kirsty alert.
KIRSTY,(sweetly) Hey Dawn.
DAWN,Hey.
KIRSTY,"How you doing, you okay?"
DAWN,"Good, thanks for asking."
DAWN,(sotto voce) Bee-yotch.
TEACHER,"Okay. Remember, we're not ... drawing the object."
Dawn and Lisa go to the back and take easels on either side of Kevin. Dawn looks nervously at him.TEACHER,We're drawing ... the negative space ... around the object.
KEVIN,(not looking at Dawn) Hey.
DAWN,(trying to be cool) Oh. Hey Kevin.
TEACHER,...and then give me a sense of the spaces around ... the space in-between.
KEVIN,What's goin' on?
DAWN,"Um, negative space. (nervous smile)"
KEVIN,"(smiles) Yeah, what's that all about?"
DAWN,(scoffs) Yeah.
KEVIN,(looks at her paper) That's pretty good.
DAWN,(smiles) Thanks.
KEVIN,"So I heard you, like, had a freak-out and cut yourself."
DAWN,"Uh, no, not even. It was a whole ... it was so not..."
KEVIN,"I've felt like that before. (Dawn looks surprised) Things get so crazed, you know, you just feel like you wanna do something ... extreme."
DAWN,"Yeah. I just ... I had a lot of intense stuff going on. (Kevin smiles, returns to his drawing) A lot of people don't understand that. Pain."
KEVIN,Yeah.
DAWN,"Then Kirsty's gotta blab it everywhere, 'cause she's-"
KEVIN,"Kirsty, man. It's like she thinks, ""I'm so hot, everybody should just bow down before me."" And I'm like, whatever."
DAWN,"She's so superficial. Everything's always about clothes, or who likes who, and... (Buffy enters the classroom, goes over to the teacher) there's just way more important stuff going on. There's a lot of ... crucial ... you know ... stuff."
KEVIN,Yeah.
DAWN,"Uh, this one time in history, uh, (Buffy begins walking down the aisle toward Dawn) she had this book called <I>Annals of History</I>, and she didn't know how to say the word ""annals"" (Kevin looks surprised) so she kept saying-"
BUFFY,Dawn.
BUFFY,I have to talk to you.
DAWN,Um...
BUFFY,(OS) What?
DAWN,Can it wait? I'm in the middle of a class.
BUFFY,I know. Please come with me.
DAWN,I thought Mom was picking me up.
DAWN,What's going on? Something's going on.
BUFFY,Let's go outside.
DAWN,No. Tell me what's going on.
BUFFY,It's ... bad ... news.
DAWN,"Well, what is it? What happened?"
BUFFY,"It's bad. Please, can we-"
DAWN,(loudly) Where's Mom?
BUFFY,"(teary) Mom ... had an accident. Or, um..."
BUFFY,(OS) ...something went ... wrong from the tumor.
DAWN,"Is she okay? Is she ... but she's okay? But ... it's, it's serious, but..."
BUFFY,Dawn...
DAWN,(faintly) No.
DAWN,"(faintly) No, it's not true. No, you're a liar, she's fine!"
TARA,I think they're here.
XANDER,Do you wanna come up?
ANYA,(softly) You're double-parked.
XANDER,(opens his door) Let 'em give me a ticket.
WILLOW,"What do you think? The, the, the purple, right? 'Cause, 'cause it's somber?"
WILLOW,"No. No, it's too depressing, i-it's like, um, a ... funeral, god, I ... (holds up the other shirt, which is yellow) Well, this is, this is cheerier, maybe, I-I wanna be cheery, like, like everything is normal?"
WILLOW,"No, that's rude, that's, that's disrespectful. ""La la la! I don't care!"""
WILLOW,"If I had that blue one - (turns back to the closet, then back) Jo-Joyce really liked the blue one. She told me one time. You, you sure it's not in your room?"
TARA,(takes a few steps closer) I-I-I could look again.
WILLOW,"No, no, I-I, I should, I should wear the purple (picks up the purple blouse from the bed) The purple, I, I, I think the purple, it's just that it's so, I don't know, (looks at Tara) i-it doesn't mean something bad?"
TARA,"I think it's, um ... royal. Purple means ... royalty."
WILLOW,"(tears running down her face) Well, I can't see Buffy at the morgue and be all royal! ""Oh, I'm the king of everything, I'm better than you!"" I have to be supportive, I, Buffy needs me to be supportive, I..."
WILLOW,"God, why do all my shirts have such stupid things on them? (tosses it back down) Why can't I just dress like a grownup? Can't I be a grownup?"
TARA,Shh.
TARA,"Shh, darling."
WILLOW,(crying) I can't do this.
TARA,We can do this.
WILLOW,Okay. We can be there for Buffy. And Dawn. (crying) Little Dawn.
TARA,We can be strong.
WILLOW,Strong like an Amazon?
TARA,"Strong like an Amazon, right."
WILLOW,"Okay. (nods, sniffles) I wish I had the blue."
Cut to,Anya and Xander climbing the stairs inside the dorm.
ANYA,So ... what do we do?
XANDER,"I'm not sure. We'll, uh, talk to Giles."
Cut to,"Anya and Xander coming out of the stairwell, walking down the dorm hallway. Various students are roaming around or standing in the halls talking."
ANYA,"Xander, what will *we* do? What will *we* be expected to do?"
XANDER,Hey.
XANDER,How you doing?
XANDER,I know the feeling.
WILLOW,I'm afraid I'm gonna start to cry again.
ANYA,(softly) Xander cried at the apartment. It was weird.
WILLOW,"I-i-it's a, it's a thing we do."
ANYA,What's going to happen?
WILLOW,"Well, I ... I guess we're gonna ... meet them at the morgue, (whispers) That's where they were ... taking ... her."
TARA,"Um, Giles said that he, he was gonna go with Joyce, and Buffy was gonna go to ... the school to ... tell Dawn."
XANDER,God.
TARA,"Do you know how to, how to get-"
XANDER,"Yeah. It's at the hospital, it's a wing. We do morgue time in the Scooby gang."
WILLOW,I have to change.
XANDER,What else did Giles say?
TARA,"(shrugs, shakes her head) Not a lot."
XANDER,"Are they sure this was ... natural? I mean, Glory."
TARA,"Uh, Giles was pretty sure that it wasn't, wasn't her."
XANDER,"But, I mean, she said she was gonna come after Buffy's family."
TARA,I don't-
XANDER,"I mean, we should be going after her. I mean, she coulda done it, and, and, covered her tracks."
WILLOW,Why would she? She'd want us to know.
XANDER,"I'll tell you what it is. It's the frickin' doctors. I mean, they just let her out, you know? Clean bill of health. Dig a hole in your skull. Here's a band-aid. Next!"
WILLOW,(OS) Xander...
XANDER,"They should have checked her over, they should have had her in. Well, don't we have enough monsters in this town, the doctors gotta help 'em out?"
WILLOW,"Xander, I-I don't think it was ... any ... it just happened."
XANDER,"(looks around at the three of them) Things don't happen! (frowns) I mean ... they don't *just* happen. (Shot of Tara looking concerned) Somebody... (shot of Willow) I mean, somebody's got..."
WILLOW,"Okay. (puts up her fists) Let's go. Come on, you and me. Come on."
XANDER,You know I can't take you.
WILLOW,Damn straight.
ANYA,Are we gonna see the body?
WILLOW,(shocked) What?
ANYA,Are we gonna be in the room ... with the dead body?
WILLOW,"(hugs herself, uncomfortably) I don't know. No."
TARA,But I guess we should take over patrolling and all that.
XANDER,Yeah.
WILLOW,"Oh, yeah."
TARA,For however long.
XANDER,You know it.
WILLOW,I can't wear this.
WILLOW,"I, I really should have the other. Joyce liked it so."
TARA,Do you think you coulda left it in the laundry room?
WILLOW,"(frowns, nods hopefully) Maybe."
TARA,"I'll go check. I'll, I'll just be one minute."
XANDER,We're cool.
ANYA,Are they gonna cut the body open?
WILLOW,(horrified) Oh my god! Would you just ... stop talking? Just ... shut your mouth. Please.
ANYA,What am I doing?
WILLOW,How can you act like that?
ANYA,Am I supposed to be changing my clothes a lot? (looks from Willow to Xander) Is that the helpful thing to do?
XANDER,Guys...
WILLOW,The way you behave-
ANYA,Nobody will tell me.
WILLOW,Because it's not okay for you to be asking these things!
ANYA,(desperate) But I don't understand!
ANYA,"(crying) I don't understand how this all happens. How we go through this. I mean, I knew her, and then she's, (sniffling) there's just a body, and I don't understand why she just can't get back in it and not be dead anymore. It's stupid. It's mortal and stupid. (still teary) And, and Xander's crying and not talking, and, and I was having fruit punch, and I thought, well, Joyce will never have any more fruit punch ever, and she'll never have eggs, or yawn or brush her hair, not ever, and no one will explain to me why."
WILLOW,(to Anya) We don't know ... how it works... (Anya wiping her face with her hands) or why.
XANDER,"Sorry, sorry, some ... pent-up..."
WILLOW,(getting up) Xander...
WILLOW,Where did your hand go?
XANDER,"As I was saying, some frustration, and now, uh ... I appear to be stuck."
ANYA,My god. (ducks under his arm to get to the other side) Is your hand okay?
XANDER,"Pretty much. I, I'm really sorry."
ANYA,(angry) You could have hit an electrical... (gestures vaguely) thing!
XANDER,And once again with the sorry.
WILLOW,Did it make you feel better? (Anya looks up at Xander)
XANDER,For a second there.
WILLOW,A whole second?
XANDER,"In my defense, some crappy wallmanship."
WILLOW,"Yeah, you can hear everything next door."
XANDER,Who did the drywall in this place?
WILLOW,I always forget to ask.
TARA,Did I miss something?
ANYA,Xander decided that he blames the wall.
WILLOW,Can you ... turn your wrist?
XANDER,Hold on.
XANDER,It's okay. (flexing his hand)
TARA,It hurts.
WILLOW,"Here, wash it off."
ANYA,(to Willow) Band-aids?
WILLOW,Underneath.
TARA,I couldn't find it.
WILLOW,(shrugs) It doesn't matter. We should get there.
TARA,Yes.
WILLOW,"I, I wanna be there for Buffy."
XANDER,(OS) You're right.
XANDER,"The avengers gotta get to the assembly. (turns to face the camera, with a towel wrapped around his hand) We'll go. We'll deal. We'll help. That's what we do. We help Buffy."
ANYA,How are we going to help?
XANDER,If there's anything we can do.
DAWN,Glad you're here.
WILLOW,Love you so much.
BUFFY,I know.
DAWN,(to Tara) They're not telling us anything.
GILES,Doctor?
DR. KRIEGEL,"Okay, I've examined your mother's body."
DAWN,Can we see her?
BUFFY,"Dawn, not now."
DR. KRIEGEL,"The on-site report seems more or less accurate. Your mother did have what looks like an aneurysm. A sudden hemorrhaging from a ruptured arterial vessel near the, uh ... where the tumor was removed."
BUFFY,"Shouldn't we have known about that, that ... was a danger?"
DR. KRIEGEL,"Sometimes these things are detectable, and sometimes they're not."
DR. KRIEGEL,"(OS) Joyce was aware of the possibility of a rupture, and the effects. She didn't even get on the phone, so clearly this was very sudden."
DR. KRIEGEL,"(OS) She, uh, may have felt a little nausea, and probably passed out as it happened."
DR. KRIEGEL,"(OS) I doubt there was much pain, and ... even if someone had been by her side..."
Flash,"Joyce in the living room, Buffy by her side. Buffy takes Joyce's hand in concern as Joyce sits on the sofa."
JOYCE,My head...
BUFFY,Mom?
Flash,"Buffy, Joyce, and Paramedic 1 in the ambulance."
Flash,"Dawn, Joyce, Buffy, and the doctor in the hospital."
DR. KRIEGEL,(OS) ...it's doubtful that this could have been dealt with in time.
GILES,"(nods) Uh, thank you, Doctor."
BUFFY,(OS) Are you sure...
BUFFY,...that there wasn't a lot of pain?
DR. KRIEGEL,(nods) Absolutely.
DR. KRIEGEL,(in Buffy's thoughts) I have to lie to make you feel better.
GILES,"What, uh, (clears throat) what, uh, needs to be done now?"
DR. KRIEGEL,"Well, there, uh, there'll be some forms, and some decisions you'll need to make."
GILES,"Uh, Buffy, why don't you let me handle those as much as I can."
BUFFY,Please.
DR. KRIEGEL: (to Buffy) We will need you to ... sign a couple of release forms.GILES,"Yes, thank you, Doctor."
GILES,"(to Buffy) I'll, uh, figure out which ones you need to see."
BUFFY,We'll be here.
XANDER,What'd the doctor say?
BUFFY,"Nothing. Uh, it's, you know, it's what we thought, the tumor."
WILLOW,Why don't we sit down?
BUFFY,Giles says he's gonna go over the paperwork.
XANDER,"Man, if there's one day they should *not* give you homework."
WILLOW,"Dawnie, do you wanna sit?"
BUFFY,(to Dawn) I don't think we're gonna have to be here very long.
DAWN,What about... (stops)
BUFFY,What about what?
DAWN,Nothing. I have to pee.
BUFFY,Do you want someone to go with you?
DAWN,(sullen) No. I still remember how to pee. (turns away)
BUFFY,Do you know where it is?
DAWN,Yeah.
BUFFY,I think maybe she's ... mad at me or something.
WILLOW,'Cause you were the one that told her?
XANDER,How'd she take it?
BUFFY,Meltdown. She just wouldn't believe me. I still don't think she does.
ANYA,(a little too loudly) I wish that Joyce didn't die...
ANYA,(more quietly) ...because she was nice. And now we all hurt.
XANDER,"(embarrassed) Anya, ever the wordsmith."
BUFFY,(to Anya) Thank you.
WILLOW,"(to Buffy) Do you want anything? Something to eat, or ... soda?"
BUFFY,"Honestly, I ... couldn't tell."
WILLOW,"Well, I-I think you should try to eat something."
BUFFY,"Yeah, maybe Dawn could use a snack."
WILLOW,"I'll, I'll find something. (gets up) Xander, do you have any money?"
XANDER,We'll come with.
WILLOW,(to Buffy) We'll be right quick.
BUFFY,"(softly, speaking to the floor) I'm sorry ... you have to go through all of this."
TARA,You don't have to worry about me.
BUFFY,Everybody wants to help. (Tara looks at her) I don't even know if I'm ... here. (Tara looks away) I don't know what's going on. Never done this. (pauses) That's just an amazingly dumb thing to say. Obviously ... I've never done this before.
TARA,(softly) I have.
TARA,My mother died when I was seventeen.
BUFFY,I didn't know. I'm sorry.
TARA,"No, no, I didn't mean to ... (sighs) I'm only telling you this because ... I know it's not m-my place, but ... (pauses) There's things ... thoughts and reactions I had that ... I couldn't ... understand ... or even try to explain to anyone else. (Buffy looks down, pensive) Thoughts that ... made me feel like I was losing it ... or, like I was some kind of ho-horrible person. I know it's different for you ... because it's always different, but ... if you ever need...."
BUFFY,Was it sudden?
TARA,What?
BUFFY,Your mother.
TARA,No. (thinks) Yes. (pauses) It's always sudden.
Cut to,"Dawn coming out of the bathroom. She looks around the corner into the waiting room, sees Buffy and Tara talking. Pan over to the door that leads to the morgue. A red sign on the door reads ""AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY."" Dawn goes over to that door."
WILLOW,We panicked.
BUFFY,(looking nervously at all the stuff) Uh-huh.
WILLOW,Have anything you want.
ANYA,The sandwiches are meat.
BUFFY,I'm just not hungry.
WILLOW,What about Dawnie? (comes to sit beside Buffy)
XANDER,(looking around) Is she still in the bathroom?
BUFFY,(frowning) I guess. (gets up) You guys wait here.
