Buffy,NO! NO!
Buffy,No...
Joyce,Yes.
Joyce,It's time to get up for school.
Buffy,Mom?
Joyce,Are you alright?
Buffy,"No. Uh, yeah! Yeah! I'm, I'm fine! Oh... (sits up) School!  Great. (gets out of bed)"
Joyce,You wanna go to school? (stands up)
Buffy,Sure! Why not?
Joyce,Okay. (opens the blinds) Good day to buy that lottery ticket. I  spoke with your father.
Buffy,"He's coming, right?"
Joyce,You're on for this weekend.
Buffy,Good.
Willow,"So, do you see your dad a lot?"
Buffy,Not a whole lot.
Buffy,"He's still in L.A. He, like, comes down for weekends sometimes."
Willow,When did they get divorced?
Buffy,"Well, it wasn't finalized till last year, but they were  separated before that."
Willow,Musta been harsh.
Buffy,"Yeah, that's the word you're looking for. (works the  combination) I-I mean, they were really good about it around me, anyway,  but still..."
Willow,My parents don't even bicker. Sometimes they glare. Do you know  why your folks split up?
Buffy,"(opens her locker) I didn't ask. They just stopped getting  along. I'm sure I was a really big help, though, with all the slaying  and everything. I was in so much trouble. I was a big mess."
Willow,"Well, I'm sure that didn't have anything to do with him  leaving."
Buffy,No. (closes her locker)
Willow,And he still comes down on weekends.
Buffy,Sometimes.
Cordelia,Hello? Doofus! (Wendell looks at her) You're in my light.
Xander,"Wendell, what is wrong with you? Don't you know that she is the  center of the universe, and the rest of us merely revolve around her?"
Cordelia,Why don't you revolve yourselves out of my light?
Xander,"(to the girls) Uh, Wendell was in Cordelia's light."
Wendell,I'm so ashamed.
Willow,Why is she so Evita-like?
Buffy,I think it's the hair.
Willow,(smiles) It weighs heavy on the cerebral cortex.
Xander,"Hey, guys, was there any homework?"
Willow,We're doing active listening today.
Xander,Cool! What's active listening?
Willow,That would be the homework. (they sit)
Buffy,Chapter five? Active listening? (shows her book) Where you put  on your big ears and really focus on the other person?
Wendell,Ms. Tishler demonstrated it yesterday.
Willow,With you!
Buffy,She was wearing that tight sweater?
Xander,"Oh, the midnight blue angora! See, I was listening."
Wendell,"Please! Get 'em off of me! Help! Help! Get 'em off of me! Help  me! Oh, please help me! Please!"
Billy,Sorry about that.
Wendell,Please help me!
Master,"Fear is a wonderful thing. It is *the* most powerful force in  the human world. (crouches to face Collin) Not love, not hate... Fear!  When you were a mortal boy, what did you fear?"
Collin,Monsters.
Master,"Ooo. (gets up) We are *defined* by the things we fear. (goes to  the large cross) This symbol, these two planks of wood, it confounds me.  Suffuses me with mortal dread. But fear is in the mind. (puts his hand  on the cross and holds on while it burns) Like pain. It can be  controlled. (lets go) If I can face my fear, it cannot master me. (looks  up) Something is happening above. Something new, powerful, psychic  force. Do you feel it?"
Collin,I feel change.
Master,Change. Yes. For the worse.
Joyce,You're awfully quiet this morning.
Buffy,I didn't sleep well.
Joyce,I'll say. I came in to check on you twice. You were yelling in  your sleep. Do you know what you were dreaming?
Buffy,"(shakes her head) Not really. Oh, no, my bag! I-I packed it for  the weekend and I forgot it!"
Joyce,You and your dad can swing by the house and get your bag. It's  not an international crisis.
Buffy,"Okay. Yeah, I just, uh, had meant to bring it. H-he's picking me  up here, right? A-at 3:30?"
Joyce,"Honey, a-are you worried your father isn't gonna show?"
Buffy,No! N-not really. Should I be?
Joyce,"Well, of course, not! I-I-I just, I-I know it's a hard  situation. You just have to remember that your father adores you. No  more than I do, by the way."
Buffy,(smiles) Goodbye.
Joyce,Have a great day.
Buffy,Thanks. (gets out)
Willow,"Oh, Buffy, we've been looking for you."
Xander,We have?
Willow,"Oh, about the spiders, did you talk to Giles about..."
Xander,"Oh, the spiders! Willow's been kind of, um, what's the word I'm  looking for? Insane about what happened yesterday."
Willow,"I don't like spiders, okay? Their furry bodies, and their  sticky webs, and what do they need all those legs for anyway? I'll tell  you: for crawling across your face in the middle of the night. Ewww! How  do they not ruffle you?"
Xander,"I'm sorry! I'm unruffled by spiders. Now, if a bunch of Nazis  crawled all over my face..."
Buffy,"Mm, it was pretty intense."
Willow,Thank you.
Xander,"Well, the Hellmouth, the center of mystical convergence,  supernatural monsters: been there."
Buffy,"Little blase' there, aren't you?"
Xander,"I'm not worried. If there's something bad out there we'll find,  you'll slay, we'll party!"
Buffy,Thanks for having confidence in me.
Xander,"You da man, Buff!"
Willow,"Okay, but we're still caring about the spiders here. Let's not  forget the spiders."
Buffy,"Well, Giles said he was gonna look it up. Giles?"
Willow,Maybe he's in the faculty room.
Buffy,"Hey, Giles! Wakey, wakey!"
Giles,"I was, uh, in the stacks. I got lost."
Xander,Did you find any theories on spiders coming out of books?
Xander,"Big, hairy, crawly..."
Xander,(to Willow) It's funny if you're me.
Giles,"(mildly confused) I couldn't find anything, uh... particularly  illuminating. Um, I think perhaps you'd best have a chat with Wendell  himself."
Buffy,Okay. If he can still talk.
Buffy,"Hey, Wendell. How are you?"
Wendell,(looks up) Huh?
Buffy,You okay?
Xander,"Good talking to ya, man."
Wendell,Do you guys want something?
Buffy,We just thought you might wanna talk about what happened.
Willow,"You know, yesterday? With the spiders?"
Wendell,I don't know what to say about that.
Xander,"There's nothing *to* say. You saw two hundred insects, you  Gonzoed, anybody would have."
Wendell,They're not insects. They're arachnids.
Xander,They're from the Middle East?
Wendell,Spiders are arachnids. They have eight legs. Insects only have  six. Why does everyone make that mistake?
Buffy,Don't know. Has anything like this ever happened before?
Buffy,When?
Wendell,Lots of times.
Willow,Ew! You must hate spiders more than I do.
Wendell,(smiles and laughs) I don't hate spiders. I love 'em. They  hate me.
Cordelia,I hope you studied for the history test.
Buffy,What history test?
Cordelia,The one we're having in fourth period right now.
Buffy,"There's a history test? Nobody told me there was a history test!  I haven't... I... Okay, I will catch up with you guys later. (runs off)"
Willow,"(sits) What do you mean, you love spiders?"
Xander,"It is platonic, right? (chuckles)"
Wendell,I had the best collection in the tri-county area. Browns and  tarantulas and black widows... Then my folks shipped me off to  wilderness camp. All my brother had to do was maintain their habitats.  Instead he left their heat lamp on for a week. When I came home they  were all dead. That's when the nightmares started.
Willow,The nightmares?
Wendell,"It's always the same. I'm sitting in the classroom, teacher  asks me to read something, I open up my book and then there they are.  They're comin' after me. God, can you blame them after what I did?"
Xander,And that's how it happens? Every time?
Wendell,"Yesterday in class I thought I'd just nodded off again. But  then everyone else started screaming, too."
Cordelia,"You don't know where class is, do you?"
Buffy,Uh...
Cordelia,Hardly a shocker. You've cut history just about every time  we've had it.
Buffy,"Well, I was there the first day. I think."
Cordelia,It's in here.
Buffy,"I haven't been to class, I haven't read any of the assignments,  how am I gonna pass this test?"
Cordelia,Blind luck?
Buffy,"Well, at least I know my name."
Laura,"Well, they both got detention, which is completely unfair since  Sean started it. Anyway, it means we can't do the movie."
Laura,I'm gonna take a (makes a smoking gesture) break.
Billy,(to himself) You shouldn't go in there. (shakes his head)
Buffy,I think they said room 3016.
Giles,Do you know the girl?
Buffy,To say hi to. Laura's nice enough. Nobody saw who attacked her?
Giles,"Well, I was rather hoping that Laura did."
Buffy,"Hey, Laura."
Laura,Hi.
Giles,"I hope we're not intruding, um..."
Laura,That's okay. I don't wanna be left alone.
Giles,"You understand we're anxious to make sure this, this doesn't  happen again."
Buffy,(sits) Can you tell us what happened?
Laura,I was in the basement. I went down for a smoke. There was...  someone there.
Buffy,Someone you knew?
Laura,I've never... seen anything like it.
Buffy,(exchanges a look with Giles) It?
Giles,Can you describe it?
Buffy,"Hey, that's okay. Don't worry about it."
Giles,"Yes, you, you, you just rest now."
Buffy,"You know, but..."
Nurse,"(comes in) Hi, Laura."
Buffy,...i-if you remember anything? You can tell us. Even if it may  seem weird.
Nurse,She needs her rest now.
Laura,'Lucky nineteen.'
Giles,I'm sorry?
Laura,"It's what he said, right before... He said 'lucky nineteen'.  That's weird, right?"
Giles,"Yes. Yes, it is."
Buffy,Feel better. (smiles)
Giles,Take care.
Giles,"Doctor, is she gonna be alright?"
Doctor,You family?
Buffy,Friends.
Doctor,"She'll recover. She's got a couple of shattered bones, a little  internal bleeding... she got off pretty easy."
Buffy,Easy?
Giles,Have you looked up the word lately?
Doctor,"Well, the first one's still in a coma. (stops at another room)"
Buffy,First what?
Doctor,"First victim. (looks into the room) They found him a week ago.  Exact same M.O. as the girl, only he's in worse shape. If he doesn't  wake up soon... Somebody's gotta stop this guy."
Buffy,Somebody will.
Punk,"Listen, I'm not afraid of him."
Punk,"Hey, if he wants to fight, then I'm takin' him down. I'm not  backin' off on this. This is about honor. I'll break his neck!"
Willow,"I'm just saying, Wendell had a dream and then that exact thing  happened."
Xander,"Which is a fair wiggins, I admit, but do you think that ties in  with Laura?"
Willow,I dunno. Maybe she dreamed about getting beat up. We should ask  Buffy when she gets back from the hospital.
Mother,"Oh, there's my little baby!"
Punk,"Mom, what are you doing here? Mom..."
Mother,(laughs and kisses) How's my little pookie?
Punk,"Mom, mom, please don't kiss me in front of the guys! It's  embarrassing, mom! Please!"
Mother,"(laughs) You cute little rascal, you!"
Punk,"Mom... Thanks, but mom, please, my friends are right here..."
Xander,"It could be a coincidence. Y'know, Wendell finds a spider's  nest, and we all wig because he dreamt about spiders. So it may not be  connected."
Xander,If there is a connection it doesn't sound like anything...  What?
Willow,Xander! What happened to your...?!
Xander,"I-I-I dunno! I was, uh, dressed a minute ago! It's a dream.  It's gotta be a dream. (pinches himself) Ow! Wake up. (pinches himself  again) Ow! Gotta wake up."
Giles,This can't be happening. This can't be...
Buffy,What's the word?
Giles,"Oh, uh, I've got back issues of the, uh, papers, um, to try to  do some research."
Buffy,Did you find anything?
Giles,I don't know.
Buffy,You don't know if you didn't find anything.
Giles,I'm having a problem.
Buffy,What is it?
Giles,I-I can't read!
Buffy,"What do you mean? You can read, like, three languages."
Giles,"Five, actually, on a normal day. Th-the words here don't make  any s-sense. I-it's gibberish! (steps away in frustration)"
Buffy,(looks at the paper) That's him.
Giles,Who?
Buffy,The kid I've been seeing around school. (reads) 'Twelve-year-old  Billy Palmer was found beaten and unconscious after his kiddie league  game Saturday. Doctors describe his condition as critical.' When was  this published? (looks at the date) Last week. It says he's in a coma in  intensive care. This is the boy from the hospital!
Giles,"The first victim? Uh... You, you've seen him around the school?"
Buffy,"Yeah, first when the spiders got Wendell, and, and then when I  didn't know a thing on the history test. I thought it was weird seeing  this kid around, but I forgot about it."
Giles,"Uh, the boy's been in a coma for a week. How can this be  possible?"
Buffy,"What, am I knowledge girl now? Explanations are your terrain."
Giles,"Uh, well, um, there's astral projection, uh, the theory that  while one sleeps one has another body, a-an astral body, which can  travel through time and space."
Buffy,"Billy's in a coma. That's like sleep, right?"
Giles,"In a manner of speaking, a-a-although one doesn't always awake  from a coma."
Buffy,Could I be seeing Billy's asteroid body?
Giles,"Astral body, and I-I don't know. As usual, one doesn't have an  inordinate amount of information to work with."
Buffy,Lucky nineteen.
Hank,There you are! I've been looking everywhere. Why aren't you in  class?
Buffy,"Dad, what are you doing here? Y-you're not supposed to pick me  up till after school. Is something wrong?"
Hank,"Well, I, I need to talk to you."
Buffy,Something *is* wrong. Is it mom?
Hank,"No, no, it's not your mother, she's fine. (quieter) Could I speak  with you for a moment? Privately?"
Buffy,"Um, sure! Yeah. (looks at Giles) Uh, oh! I'm sorry. Dad, this is  Mr. Giles, the librarian. Uh, this is my dad, Hank Summers."
Giles,My pleasure. (shakes his hand)
Hank,Likewise.
Buffy,I'll be back.
Hank,I came early because there's something I've needed to tell you.  About your mother and me. Why we split up.
Buffy,"Well, you always told me it was because..."
Hank,"Uh, I know we always said it was because we'd just grown too far  apart."
Buffy,"Yeah, isn't that true?"
Hank,"Well, c'mon, honey, let's, let's sit down. (they sit) (exhales)  You're old enough now to know the truth."
Buffy,Is there someone else?
Hank,"No. No, it was nothing like that."
Buffy,Then what was it?
Hank,It was you.
Buffy,Me?
Hank,"Having you. Raising you. Seeing you everyday. I mean, do you have  any idea what that's like?"
Buffy,What?
Hank,"Gosh, you don't even see what's right in front of your face, do  you? Well, big surprise there, all you ever think about is yourself. You  get in trouble. You embarrass us with all the crazy stunts you pull, and  do I have to go on?"
Buffy,No. Please don't.
Hank,"You're sullen and... rude and... you're not nearly as bright as I  thought you were going to be... Hey, Buffy, let's be honest. Could you  stand to live in the same house with a daughter like that?"
Buffy,Why are you saying all these things? (a tear rolls down her  cheek)
Hank,Because they're true. I think that's the least we owe one  another.
Hank,"You know, I don't think it's very mature, getting blubbery when  I'm just trying to be honest. Speaking of which, I don't really get  anything out of these weekends with you. So, what do you say we just  don't do them anymore?"
Hank,I sure thought you'd turn out differently.
Xander,Red alert! Where's Buffy?
Giles,"Uh, she, she just stepped out. Her, her father came by early.  He, he needed to talk to her. W... where are your other clothes?"
Xander,"Oh, don't I wish I had the answer to *that* question."
Willow,Xander kinda found himself in front of our class not wearing  much of anything.
Xander,Except my underwear.
Willow,(laughs) Yeah! It was really... (looks at Xander) ...bad. It  was a bad thing.
Xander,'Bad thing'? I was naked. 'Bad thing' doesn't cover it.
Willow,Everyone staring? I would hate to have everyone paying  attention to me like that.
Xander,With nudity! It's a total nightmare.
Willow,"(realizes) Well, yeah Xander! I-it's your nightmare!"
Xander,Except the part with me waking up goin' 'it's all a dream'. It  happened.
Willow,Like it happened to Wendell. That thing with the spiders?  Wendell had a recurring dream about that.
Giles,I-I dreamt that I got lost in the stacks and I... I couldn't  read... Of course!
Xander,"Uh, our dreams are coming true?"
Giles,"Dreams? That would be a musical comedy version of this.  Nightmares, our, our nightmares are coming true."
Willow,"So, why is this happening?"
Giles,Billy.
Xander,"Well, that explanation was shorter than usual. (to Willow) It's  Billy! (to Giles) Who's Billy?"
Giles,He's a boy in the local hospital. He was beaten. He's in a coma.  Somehow I think he's crossed over from the nightmare world he's trapped  in.
Xander,"And he brought the nightmare world with him. Thanks a bunch,  Billy."
Willow,How could he do that?
Giles,Things like that are easy when you live on a Hellmouth.
Xander,"Well, um, we have to stop it."
Giles,And soon. Or else everyone in Sunnydale is gonna be facing their  own worst nightmares.
Cordelia,I don't understand! This can't be happening! I was just at  the salon!
Cordelia,"Oh, my God!"
Buffy,Billy?
Buffy,Are you Billy Palmer?
Billy,I'm Billy.
Buffy,Why are you here? (sits down next to him) Did something bad  happen to you after your game?
Billy,"Something bad? (pulls his hands through his hair) I, I don't  remember."
Buffy,Do you remember playing baseball?
Billy,Uh huh. Yeah. I play second base.
Buffy,Are you 'lucky nineteen'?
Billy,(looks at her) That's what he calls me.
Buffy,Who?
Billy,The Ugly Man. He wants to kill me. A-and he hurt that girl.
Buffy,"Why does he want to kill you, Billy?"
Billy,He's...
Buffy,"Billy, it's okay! What? Just tell me."
Billy,He's here!
Giles,"Buffy doesn't know this is happening. And given the sort of  thing that she tends to dream about, it's imperative that we find her."
Xander,Probably faster if we split up to look for her.
Giles,Good idea.
Willow,"Oh, uh, faster, but... not really safer."
Buffy,Billy!
Billy,"I'm sorry, I can't help it."
Buffy,Who is he?
Billy,He's the Ugly Man.
Buffy,He's too strong! I can't fight him! We have to find my friends.  They can help us.
Billy,We have to hide.
Buffy,No! He'll find us!
Billy,"Yes, but we have to hide. That's how it happens. We hide, and  then he comes."
Cordelia,"No! What are you doing! Hey, no! You don't understand! I  don't wanna go! I'm not even on the chess team! I swear, I'm not!"
Voice,Willow!
Cordelia,Nohoho!
Voice,Willow!
Willow,Buffy?
Willow,Hello? Buffy?
Willow,"I'm not afraid. You'd think I'd be afraid, but I'm not."
Xander,Alright! (picks up the bar and tears it open) Someone else's  loss is my chocolatey goodness.
Xander,This is my lucky day!
Buffy,(confused) Wha... I was sure this led to the library.
Buffy,They're just playing. What is it? What's bothering you?
Billy,"Baseball. When you lose, it's bad."
Buffy,Did you lose your game last week?
Billy,(nods) It was my fault.
Buffy,Why was it your fault?
Billy,I missed a ball and I should have caught it.
Buffy,"You missed one ball and the whole game was your fault? What, you  were the only one playing? There wasn't eight other people on your team?"
Billy,He said it was my fault.
Buffy,"Who said? Billy, did he hurt you after the game?"
Billy,Can we go another way to find your friends?
Buffy,Sure. Okay. We can go around the cafeteria.
Buffy,"Bad idea! (looks around) Uh, this way! C'mon!"
Buffy,What just happened?
Billy,Is this where your friends are?
Buffy,"No, it's not."
Director,"Man, I thought you weren't gonna show! Aldo is beside  himself."
Emcee,"Ladies and Gentlemen, we are proud to present two of the world's  greatest singers!"
Director,I hope you're warmed up. It's an ugly crowd out there  tonight. All the reviewers showed up.
Emcee,"All the way from Firenze, Italy, the one and only Aldo  Gianfranco! And all the way from Sunnydale, California, the world's  finest soprano, Willow Rosenberg!"
Willow,But I... I didn't learn the words!
Aldo,"Bimba dagli occhi pieni di malia, ora sei tutta mia."
Translation,"Child, from whose eyes the witchery is shining, now you  are all my own."
Aldo,Sei tutta vestita di giglio. Mi piace la treccia tua bruna fra i  candidi veli.
Translation,You're dressed all in white like a lily. Your ebony  tresses are shining on ivory shoulders.
Willow,(meekly) My turn?
Aldo,(annoyed) Mm-hmm!
Xander,I love these bars!
Xander,A Chocolate Hurricane! These are the best! I haven't had one of  these since my...
Xander,...sixth... (looks around) ...birthday.
Buffy,I don't see the Ugly Man. I also don't know where the sun and  the rest of the world went.
Billy,Look at this.
Billy,I guess we're gonna bury someone. I wonder who died.
Master,Nobody died.
Master,What's the fun of burying someone if they're already dead?
Buffy,You!
Master,So! This is the Slayer! You're prettier than the last one.
Buffy,This isn't real. Y-you can't be free!
Master,"You still don't understand, do you? I am free because you fear  it. Because you fear it, the world is crumbling. Your nightmares are  made flesh. You have little Billy to thank for that."
Buffy,This is a dream.
Master,"A dream is a wish your heart makes. (grabs Buffy by the neck.)  This is real life. (pulls her around so her back is to the open grave)  Come on, Slayer! What are you afraid of?"
Buffy,No! Help me!
Master,How 'bout being buried alive?
Buffy,Somebody help me! Please! No! No! Please! No! No! No! Somebody  help me! Please! No!
Buffy,Please! No! Help me! No!
Buffy,Help!
Xander,Did you find Buffy?
Willow,I had to sing! Very bad to sing!
Xander,"Willow, c'mon. Let's find the others."
Willow,What happened to you?
Xander,Remember my sixth birthday party?
Willow,"(laughs) Oh, yeah! When the clown chased you and you got so  scared that you had... (stops smiling) Oh!"
Giles,No sign of Buffy?
Xander,You are a lousy clown! Your balloon animals are pathetic!  Everyone can make a giraffe!
Xander,I feel good! I feel liberated!
Giles,You seem to be the only one. Things are getting worse. In a few  hours reality will fold completely into the realm of nightmares.
Willow,"Well, what do we do?"
Giles,The only thing I can think is to try and wake Billy.
Xander,"Uh, no, we can't leave without Buffy."
Giles,"Agreed, but who knows where she might have gone?"
Willow,"Excuse me, when did they put a cemetery in across the street?"
Xander,And when did they make it night over there?
Xander,Whose nightmare is this?
Giles,It's mine.
Giles,I've failed... in my duty to protect you. I should have been  more c... cautious. Taken more time to train you. But you were so  gifted. And the evil was so great. I'm sorry...
Giles,Buffy?
Buffy,I thought I was dead!
Willow,"Buffy, your face!"
Buffy,"Oh, God!"
Xander,Buffy...
Buffy,(turns away) Don't look at me!
Giles,You never told me you dreamt of becoming a vampire.
Buffy,This isn't a dream.
Giles,"No. No, it's not. But there's a chance that we can make it go  away. This all comes from Billy. Now, if, if we can only wake him up, I  believe that the nightmares will stop and reality will shift back into  place, but we must do it now! I need you to hold together long enough to  help us. Can you do that?"
Buffy,(nods) Yeah. I think I can.
Giles,Thank you.
Buffy,"Well, we better hurry... 'cause I'm getting hungry. (starts  away)"
Xander,"(following) That is a... joke, right?"
Willow,Are you sure everything will go back once he's awake?
Giles,"Oh, uh, positive."
Willow,"Well, how do we wake Billy up? What if we can't?"
Giles,"Willow, do shut up."
Giles,Doctor! Is the boy Billy still here?
Doctor,My hands!
Xander,What now?
Giles,Um... (bends down to Billy) Billy! Billy?
Billy,That won't work.
Giles,"Billy! Uh, Billy, you have to wake up."
Billy,No. I told her. I have to hide.
Giles,Why? From what?
Buffy,From him!
Xander,"Aw, man, what do we do?"
Buffy,I think I know.
Willow,"Whatever it is, it better be soon!"
Buffy,"Glad you showed up! You see, I'm having a really bad day."
Buffy,"Scary! I'll tell you something, though. There are a lot scarier  things than you. (takes two steps forward) And I'm one of them."
Billy,I-is he dead?
Buffy,"Come here, Billy."
Billy,"I, I don't..."
Buffy,You have to do the rest.
Willow,What are they doing?
Xander,I get it.
Buffy,No more hiding.
Xander,"Hey, he's waking up!"
Billy,"I had the strangest dream. And you were in it, and you... Who  are you people?"
Giles,Let's get a doctor.
Coach,"Oh! Huh. Billy's got company. (takes off his cap) I-I-I'm his  kiddie league coach. I come by here every day, just hoping against hope  that he's gonna wake up soon. He's, uh, my lucky nineteen."
Coach,"So, um, how is he?"
Buffy,He's awake.
Coach,What?
Buffy,"You blamed him for losing the game. So you caught up with him  afterwards, didn't you?"
Coach,(acting innocent) What are you talking about?
Billy,(sits up) You said that it was my fault that we lost.
Billy,It wasn't my fault. There's eight other players on the team. You  know that. (lies down)
Buffy,(to Billy) Nice going! (smiles)
Buffy,I just can't believe a kiddie league coach would do something  like that.
Xander,"Well, you obviously haven't played kiddie league. I'm surprised  it wasn't one of the parents."
Willow,I'm just glad he's behind bars where he belongs.
Buffy,"But that was kinda heroic, Xander, grabbing him and all."
Xander,"Well, I just did what anyone else would've. I mean, if you  wanna label it heroic..."
Hank,Hi!
Buffy,"Have a killer weekend, guys!"
Hank,"Hi, sweetheart! Oh, it's so good to see you! (releases the hug)  How was your day?"
Buffy,"Fine. You know, usual."
Willow,(to Xander) Personal question?
Xander,"Yeah, shoot!"
Willow,"When Buffy was a vampire, you weren't still, like, attracted to  her, were you?"
Xander,"Willow, how can you... I mean, that's really bent! She was...  grotesque!"
Willow,"Still dug her, huh?"
Xander,"I'm sick, I need help."
Willow,Don't I know it.
