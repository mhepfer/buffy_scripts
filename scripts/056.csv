Xander,"""Uh - inbreeding?"""
Cordelia,"""So very funny.  Any minute I am sure to laugh.  I just got off the phone with him.  He could hardly speak he was so upset.  He said there was something about a fight?  And he is leaving the country."""
Giles,"""Should I assay remorse?"""
Cordelia,"""Just tell me what's going on."""
Giles,"""Buffy has quit the council.  She'll not be working with Wesley from now on."""
Cordelia,"""But he is her Watcher."""
Giles,"""Buffy no longer needs a Watcher."""

Angel,"""A phone."""
Doctor,"""Right out there."""
Doctor,"""The bones are set, and the damage to the kidneys is repairable."""
Doctor,"""But the head trauma, its… well its simply to severe.  You know, it’s a wonder she's alive at all, with the blood loss. - I… I'm sorry Sir, there is almost no chance at all that she is ever going to regain consciousness."""
Mayor,"""It's your day."""
Nurse,"""We have another girl with severe blood loss.  Doctor Pal wants you to prep this on an anti cubal cut down (??)."""
Doctor,"""I'll be right there."""
Nurse,"""Oh, my God.  Sir!  No!"""
Nurse,"""Somebody call security!"""
Angel,"""Don't do that!"""
Mayor,"""I will.  I do that and *worse*.  Murderous little fiend!  Did you see what she did to my Faith?"""
Angel,"""Hadn't any plans to weep over that one."""
Mayor,"""Well, I'd get set for some weeping if I were you.  I'd get set for a *world* of pain!  Misery loves company, young man, and I'm looking to share that with you and your *whore*!"""
Mayor,"""Looks like somebody has been eating his spinach. No, its okay, folks.  It's all right.  The show's not over, but there will be a short intermission. Don't want to miss the second act. All kinds of excitement!"""
Angel,"""I'll be there."""

Oz,"""Well, you seem all right, too."""
Angel,"""Yeah."""
Xander,"""What happened?"""
Willow,"""When we left her she was fine.  Did Faith…"""

Giles,"""You fed off her."""
Angel,"""Yes."""
Giles,"""How much?"""
Angel,"""She's gonna be fine."""
Willow,"""She won't be a vampire?"""
Angel,"""No. - She didn't feed off me."""
Xander,"""Well, its just good to know that when the chips are down and things look grim you'll feed off the girl who *loves* you to save your own *ass*!"""
Giles,"""You better go, Angel.  We'll watch over her."""
Angel,"""I don't want to…"""
Giles,"""The sun will be up soon."""
Xander,"""Gosh, I'm really going to miss him when he leaves town."""
Giles,"""Let's go find out how Buffy's doing."""
Buffy,"""Who's going to look after him?"""
Faith,"""It's a she.  And aren't these things supposed to take care of themselves?"""
Buffy,"""A higher power guiding us?"""
Faith,"""I'm pretty sure that's not what I meant."""
Buffy,"""There's something I'm supposed to be doing."""
Faith,"""Oh yeah. - Miles to go - Little Ms. Muffet counting down from 7-3-0."""
Buffy,"""Great. - Riddles."""
Faith,"""Sorry, it's my head.  A lot of new stuff."""
Faith,"""They are never going to fix this, are they?"""
Buffy,"""What about you?"""
Faith,"""Scar tissue.  It fades.  It all fades."""
Faith,"""You want to know the deal?  Human weakness - never goes away.  Not even his."""
Buffy,"""Is this your mind or mine?"""
Faith,"""Beats me."""
Faith,"""Getting towards that time."""
Buffy,"""How are you going to fit all this stuff?"""
Faith,"""Not gonna.  It's yours."""
Buffy,"""I can't use all of this!"""
Faith,"""Just take what you need."""
Faith,"""You're ready?"""
Willow,"""Buffy!"""
Xander,"""Are you okay?"""
Giles,"""How do you feel?"""
Buffy,"""Is Angel here?"""

Giles,"""Buffy, are you sure you're all right?"""
Buffy,"""I'm ready."""
Willow,"""Ready for what?"""
Buffy,"""War."""
High,"there are benches set up for the graduation and a podium for the speaker.  Snyder stands at a table holding a box full of diplomas, tapping one of them in his hands and looking around, then sticking it into the box with the others."
Buffy,"""So, am I crazy?"""
Willow,"""Well, 'crazy' is such a *strong* word."""
Giles,"""Let's not rule it out though."""
Buffy,"""You don't think it can be done?"""
Giles,"""I didn't say that.  I might, - but not yet."""
Cordelia,"""I personally don't think it's impossible to come up with a crazier plan."""
Oz,"""We attack the Mayor with humus."""
Cordelia,"""I stand corrected."""
Oz,"""Just trying to keep things in perspective."""
Cordelia,"""Thank you. - My point however is, crazy or not, it's pretty much the only plan. - Besides, it's Buffy's, - and she's slay gal, - you know, Ms little Likes-to-fight.  So.."""
Xander,"""I think there was a 'yea' vote buried in there somewhere."""
Buffy,"""Well, I'm going to need every single one of you on board.  Especially you Xander.  You're sort of the key figure here."""
Xander,"""Key? - Me?  (takes a deep breath) Okay, - pride, - humility, - and here is the mind numbing fear.  (sighs)  What do I have to do?"""
Buffy,"""Do you remember any of your military training from when you became soldier guy?"""
Xander,"""Uh, rocket launcher?"""
Buffy,"""Rocket launcher not going to get it done.  I mean, it took a volcano to kill one of these things last time."""
Giles,"""Um, Buffy, all of this is rather depended on your being able to control the Mayor."""
Buffy,"""Faith told me to play on his human weakness."""
Willow,"""Faith told you?  Was that before or after you put her into a coma?"""
Buffy,"""After."""
Willow,"""Oh."""
Giles,"""His weakness."""
Buffy,"""Right."""
Giles,"""Which is…?"""
Buffy,"""You know I do all this planing.  I'm in charge here, even though I am really not at my best…"""
Giles,"""Well, let's… let's…ah, let's think."""
Oz,"""Well, Angel, you hung with him the most.  Is there something that he's afraid of?"""
Angel,"""Well, he's not crazy about germs."""
Cordelia,"""Of course, that's it.  We attack him with germs!"""
Buffy,"""Great!  We'll corner him and then you can sneeze on him."""
Cordelia,"""No!  No, we'll get a box with the Ebola virus and… and….  Or it doesn't even have to be real, we can just get a box that says Ebola on it and… uhm (snaps her fingers) chase him… with the box…"""
Xander,"""I'm starting to lean towards the humus offensive."""
Oz,"""He'll never see it coming."""
Angel,"""Faith."""
Buffy,"""Faith?"""
Angel,"""At the hospital he was grieving.  Seriously crazed, and not just in a homicidal I want to be a demon way.  She is his weak link."""
Buffy,"""Faith.  I can work that."""
Wesley,"""You haven't an enormous amount of time."""
Xander,"""Hey it's Mr. States-the-Obvious."""
Buffy,"""The council is not welcome here.  I have no time for orders.  If I need someone to scream like a woman I'll give you a call."""
Wesley,"""I'm not here for the council.  Just tell me how I can help."""
Cordelia,"""That is so classy!  Isn't he just so classy?"""
Buffy,"""It's a start."""
Wesley,"""So there is something I can do… besides scream like a woman."""
Buffy,"""There is plenty.  There is chores for everyone.  Okay, this is…"""
Mayor,"""…how it's going to lay out.  The transformation should begin at exactly 3:28.  I'll just be finishing my speech - you know, it's too bad you fellows have to miss that, because I think it speaks to everyone of us.  I mean, heck, I've been working on it for a hundred years.  It better be good.  (laughs)  They'll try to run, of course, and this is when I'll need you boys in flanking position."""
Vampire,"""But Sir, the sun!"""
Mayor,"""Not a problem."""
Wesley,"""Darkness will follow and day becomes night."""
Buffy,"""An eclipse."""
Wesley,"""Standard procedure for an ascension?"""
Angel,"""That puts me back into the game."""
Buffy,"""Yea, it does.  You and Xander are going to have to work together now.  Can you guys handle that?"""
Xander,"""But I'm still key-guy, right?"""
Buffy,"""Right."""
Xander,"""Then Angel, - in his non key-guy capacity, - can work with me."""
Angel,"""What fun."""
Xander,"""Hey!  Key-guy is still talking…"""
Buffy,"""Oh, that's good!  Start bickering.  That's going to look great for us."""
Buffy,"""You guys are like little old ladies!"""
Mayor,"""You come up through the sewers here.  The important thing is containment.  I'll need to feed.  It's crucial in the first few minutes to sustain the change.  What does that mean?  (shakes his finger at them)  No snacking.  I see blood on your lips, it's a visit to the wood shed for you boys.  Kill.  Don't feed."""
Buffy,"""So, how are we coming on vulcano detail?"""
Oz,"""I think we can work it out."""
Willow,"""Fun with chemistry."""
Buffy,"""Xander said he should be able to get the materials."""
Oz,"""Who's going to stoke it up?"""
Buffy,"""You feel up to it?"""
Giles,"""Ah, I suppose it should be I.  It's strangely fitting in a grotesque fashion."""
Buffy,"""Okay guys, start reaching out.  Giles weapons, weapons, weapons."""
Giles,"""Ah, what about you?"""
Buffy,"""There is something I have to get."""
Mayor,"""Remember: fast and brutal.  It's going to be a whole new world come nightfall, don't want to weaken now.   (the vampires start leaving his office)  And boys? - Let's watch the swearing."""
Xander,"""Harmony, listen, I need to talk to you for a second."""
Harmony,"""You mean in front of other people?"""
Percy,"""Are they serious?  I'm going to look stupid in this!"""
Willow,"""Percy!"""
Percy,"""Do I look stupid in this?  Be honest."""
Willow,"""You look great.  You got a sec?"""
Wesley,"""Cordelia."""
Cordelia,"""Yes."""
Wesley,"""You know that… when this is over…"""
Cordelia,"""Yes."""
Wesley,"""uhm, well, should we prevail… I'll be going back to England."""
Cordelia,"""I know."""
Wesley,"""With Buffy no longer working for the council, there really is… no place for me here."""
Cordelia,"""I guess not."""
Wesley,"""No… reason to stay."""
Cordelia,"""No."""
Wesley,"""No.  No… cause to hope that…"""
Wesley,"""I might be needed?"""
Cordelia,"""Needed?"""
Wesley,"""Or… wanted…"""
Cordelia,"""Wanted…"""
Cordelia,"""Good look in England."""
Wesley,"""Yes, uhm, I'll drop you a line some time."""
Cordelia,"""That'll be neat."""
Wesley,"""Yes, hmm…"""
Oz,"""Okay, put these with the others.  Don't touch anything."""
Jonathon,"""Uh, wha… what do we do then?"""
Oz,"""Nothing."""
Willow,"""Just relax.  Have a good time."""
Jonathon,"""O… Okay."""
Larry,"""Okay, it's clear.  Lets move."""
Willow,"""I guess that's it.  Won't be long now."""
Oz,"""You nervous?"""
Willow,"""Only in a… terrified way."""
Oz,"""We'll make it through this."""
Willow,"""Are you sure?"""
Oz,"""I sound pretty sure, don't I?"""
Willow,"""Yeah."""
Oz,"""Then I must be sure."""
Willow,"""Is that just a comforting way of not answering the question?"""
Willow,"""How long till graduation?"""
Oz,"""A little while."""
Angel,"""Did you get what you needed?"""
Buffy,"""Yeah, I did."""
Buffy,"""This isn't going to be enough."""
Angel,"""Giles is on it."""
Angel,"""How are you?"""
Buffy,"""I heal fast.  Like you."""
Buffy,"""So, are we sure that everyone knows what their position…"""
Angel,"""I'm not going to say good-bye."""
Angel,"""If we get through this… I'm just going to go."""
Angel,"""You understand?"""
Angel,"""There is just too much to…"""
Snyder,"""Congratulations to the class of 1999.  You all proved more or less adequate.  This is a time of celebration, so sit still and be quiet. Spit out that gum. - Please welcome our distinguished guest speaker Richard Wilkins the 3rd.  I saw that gesture.  You see me after graduation."""
Willow,"""Am I late?  To the fight?"""
Mayor,"""Well.  What a day this is! - Special day.  Today is our centennial the one hundreds anniversary of the founding of Sunnydale, and I know what that means to all you kids: not - a darn thing.  Because today something much more important happens. today you all graduate from high school.  Today all the pain, all the work, all the excitement is finally over.  And what's a hundred years of history compared to that?  You know what kids? …"""
Buffy,"""Oh my God.  He's going to do the entire speech."""
Willow,"""Man, just ascend already."""
Buffy,"""Evol!"""
Mayor,"""… for all of you it may be that there is a place in Sunnydale's history, whether you like it or not.  It's been a long road getting here.  For you… for Sunnydale.  There has been achievement, joy, good times,… and there has been grief.  There's been loss.  Some people who should be here today… aren't. But we are. - Journey's end.  And what is a journey?  Is it just… distance traveled?  Time spent? No.  It's what happens on the way, it the things that happen to you.  At the end of the journey you're not the same.  Today is about change. Graduation doesn't just mean your circumstances change, it means you do.  You ascend… to a higher level.  Nothing will ever be the same.  Nothing."""
Mayor,"""And so as we look back on… on the events that brought us to this day"""
Buffy,"""Come on."""
Mayor,"""We…"""
Mayor,"""we must all…"""
Mayor,"""It has begun.  My destiny.  It's a little sooner then I expected I had this whole section on civic pride… But I guess we'll just skip to the big finish!"""
Buffy,"""Now!"""
Buffy,"""Flame units."""
Xander,"""First wave! Fire!"""
Snyder,"""This… this is simply unacceptable!"""
Oz,"""Xander?"""
Xander,"""Arm bow men Fire!"""
Buffy,"""Fall back!"""
Xander,"""Fire!"""
Snyder,"""This is not orderly.  This is not discipline!"""
Snyder,"""You're on my campus buddy!"""
Snyder,"""And when I say I want quiet, I want…"""
Buffy,"""Fall Back!  Get back! Go!"""
Willow,"""Good luck!"" then leaves."
Buffy,"""Xander take 'em down."""
Xander,"""Everyone: hand to hand!"""
Xander,"""Everyone!  Lets go!  Move!  Move!"""
Vampire,"""Get the kids!"""
Xander,"""Right flank close in.  Close! Jason and Paul you guys are right flank!"""
Wesley,"""How about some help here…"""
Buffy,"""Hey!"""
Buffy,"""You remember this?"""
Buffy,"""I took it from Faith.  Stuck it in her gut."""
Buffy,"""Just slid in her like she was butter."""
Buffy,"""You want to get it back from me Dick?"""
Mayor,"""Well, gosh."""
Wesley,"""If I could… could just get something for the pain.  It's rather a lot of pain, actually.  Aspirin?  If you would… uh… ah…"""
Wesley,"""Perhaps I could just be knocked unconscious."""
Xander,"""We got off pretty cheap… considering."""
Buffy,"""Seems like we did."""
Xander,"""He made it through the fight."""
Xander,"""Guess maybe he took off after."""
Giles,"""Are you all right?"""
Buffy,"""I'm tired."""
Giles,"""I should imagine so.  It's been quite a couple of days."""
Buffy,"""I haven't processed everything yet.  My brain isn't really functioning on the higher levels. It's pretty much fire bad; tree pretty."""
Giles,"""Understandable.  Well, when it's working again congratulate it on a good campaign.  You did very well."""
Buffy,"""Thank you.  I will."""
Giles,"""I ah… I managed to ferret this out of the wreckage.  Now, it may not interest you, but…"""
Giles,"""I'd say you earned it."""
Giles,"""There is a certain dramatic irony that's attached to all this.  A Synchronicity that borders on… on predestination, one might say."""
Buffy,"""Fire bad; tree pretty.'"
Giles,"""Yes, s…sorry. I'm going to see to Wesley, see if he's… is still… whimpering."""
Cordelia,"""Well, that’s the most fun you can have without having any fun."""
Willow,"""How about the part where we kicked some demon ass."""
Willow,"""I didn't hate that."""
Xander,"""Hear, hear!"""
Buffy,"""You guys want to take off?  I think we've done pretty much all we can."""
Cordelia,"""I'm for it."""
Willow,"""Are you okay?"""
Buffy,"""Yeah… I'm okay. - I could use a little sleep though."""
Willow,"""Yeah."""
Buffy,"""If someone could just wake me when it's time to go to college, that'd be great."""
Oz,"""Guys take a moment to deal with this: - we survived."""
Buffy,"""It was a hell of a battle!"""
Oz,"""Not the battle high school."""
Oz,"""We're taking a moment"""
Oz,"""and we're done."""
Xander,"""Well, School's done."""
Xander,"""It's ssso… Cool!"""
Willow,"""Why do demons even come here any more?  I mean, don't they know…"""
