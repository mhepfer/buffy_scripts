GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
MONK,We had to hide the key ... made it human and sent it to you.
BUFFY,Dawn.
DOCTOR,"OK, your mom's in recovery."
BUFFY,Is she all right?
DOCTOR,I think your mother's gonna be fine.
SPIKE,I wanna show you something.
RILEY,Harder.
RILEY,Buffy.
BUFFY,"I've given you everything that I have, my heart, my body and soul!"
RILEY,"I just don't feel it. They want me back, Buffy. The military."
RILEY,I'm leaving tonight.
BUFFY,Riley!
Episode begins,"Exterior shot of Xander's apartment building, night."
XANDER,You ever have that feeling where there's something you know you're supposed to do and you forgot what it was?
ANYA,Nope.
XANDER,"I've been having that feeling, I just realized what it was. (looks at Anya) Like three weeks ago Riley asked me to borrow a crescent wrench. (shakes his head) I keep having this feeling like I'm supposed to give it to him."
ANYA,"Well, that's not going to happen unless he comes back. You know, not to get the crescent wrench. Just to come back."
XANDER,"I just mean, sometimes I sort of forget that he's gone. It's like, ""where's Riley? Oh wait, the central republic of Where-in-the-hell."""
ANYA,(softly) Xander?
ANYA,"If you ever decide to go, I want a warning. You know, big flashing red lights, and-and-and one of those clocks that counts down like a bomb in a movie? And there's a whole bunch of, of colored wires, and I'm not sure which is the right one to cut, but I guess the green one, and then at the last second ""No! The red one!"" and then click, it stops with three-tenths of a second left, but then you don't leave. (pause) Like that, okay?"
XANDER,Check. Big bomb clock. (She smiles) Come here.
ANYA,Maybe it's her.
XANDER,Huh?
ANYA,"Well, maybe it won't happen to us because it's all about *her* messing things up. She couldn't make it work with Angel, and then she let Riley go away."
XANDER,"Yeah, relationship debris is kind of piling up on the Buffy highway."
ANYA,"Hmm. Humans make the same mistakes over and over. I saw it when I was a vengeance demon. Some guy dumps a girl, she calls me, I exact vengeance, blah blah blah, the next year, same girl, different guy. I mean, after you smite a few of 'em you start going ""my goodness, young lady ... maybe you're doing something wrong here too."""
XANDER,"I don't think it's a pattern with her. No, it's just ... you know, now that it happened again ... man number two ... I wonder how she's dealing with it."
Cut to,a courtyard filled with nuns. The camera follows one of them whom we only see from the back. She has a blonde curl of hair sticking out from under her habit.
NUN,"What, what, what was that, he looked like a, a demon!"
BUFFY,"Yeah, he did. Are you okay?"
NUN,"Yeah, I think so."
BUFFY,Here.
BUFFY,"So, um, a-about being a nun... (They begin to walk along together) you know, um, with the whole ... abjuring the company of men ... you know, how's that working for you? The... abjuring."
NUN,(confused) Um ... good.
BUFFY,"Yeah, do you, do you have to be like super-religious?"
NUN,"Well, uh..."
BUFFY,How's the food?
GILES,All right. Switch. Left lead.
BUFFY,So you really think they might be able to help us?
GILES,"Uh, if you mean are they gonna help us find out something about Glory ... I saw that coming. You're dropping your shoulder. (Buffy looks surprised, continues hitting) Uh, the resources that the ... Watchers Council has at their disposal, (wistfully) I mean the Central Library alone is just..."
BUFFY,(sternly) Don't talk about the books again. You get all ... and sometimes there's drool.
GILES,"I'm sorry, but we, we've really exhausted the materials I have here, and we're coming up empty. (More hitting) You're, you're still dropping your shoulder. I can see when you're gonna go with your right. (More hitting) You're doing it again!"
GILES,Ow!
BUFFY,"Sorry! Sorry. So, Glory's all you're gonna talk to them about, right?"
GILES,"(nods, rubs his shoulder) Let's, let's take a break. (Turns away)"
BUFFY,Answer me.
GILES,"(moving away, gestures with the mitts still on his hands) I, I'm not gonna mention Dawn's name. I wouldn't do that, I promise."
BUFFY,But you're gonna tell them about the key? That Glory's looking for something called the key?
GILES,"(removes mitts) Well, knowing her goal is, is crucial. I mean, i-i-if anything helps them uncover her origins, her, her plans..."
BUFFY,I know. It's just I trust these Watchers about as far as ... you could throw them.
GILES,(pouring himself a glass of water) Thank you very much.
BUFFY,(sighs) I'm just freaked about the idea of giving them any information that could possibly lead them to Dawn. (She comes over and sits on a bench. Giles sits next to her)
GILES,"Truly, Buffy, if I saw an alternative ... if, if the Initiative were still around, I'd consider using them, but... they're gone, and then Riley was, was, uh, the last link we had to the government."
GILES,"Sorry, I didn't mean to...."
BUFFY,"It's okay. You can say his name. (pensively) I'm doing all right. These things happen. People break up and they move on ... for a while it feels like the end of the world, you know, but ... big picture..."
GILES,Not so huge.
BUFFY,"Not so huge? I just said it feels like the end of the world, don't you listen?"
BUFFY,(whispers) I'm teasing.
GILES,(relieved smile) Oh.
BUFFY,Sort of. I'll be okay.
GILES,"Well, I do hate to go if you're feeling badly."
BUFFY,"look, if it help you find out something about Glory, (pats him on the back) I'm thrilled to have you gone."
Cut to,"magic shop, day. Anya, Xander, Willow, Tara, and Buffy sit around the round table looking at books and papers. Xander has Willow on his right and Anya on his left. Giles stands next to the table fastening his tie."
ANYA,You're going away for a *week*? That's great!
GILES,"Yes, yes, everybody seems delighted about it. (picks something up to read)"
ANYA,"Well, I get to run the store, right?"
GILES,"You? Ah, w-well, it's quite a lot for one person to take care of. Well, I-I mean, the trash men, for example, I mean, they, they, they've been making such a mess in the back alley, the recycling people can't get in there to collect. Well, somebody has to talk to them."
ANYA,I can take care of that.
TARA,"I'm envious, Mr. Giles. A trip to England sounds so exciting and exotic. (realizes) Un...less you're English. (Giles grins)"
BUFFY,"Look, don't worry about the shop. We'll take care of it. We can open and close, and, and we'll deal with everyone."
WILLOW,"We can come by between classes! Usually I use that time to copy over my class notes with a system of different colored pens ... but it's been pointed out to me that that's, you know, insane."
TARA,"I said ""quirky."""
ANYA,"(annoyed) Hello, I work here! I'll take care of everything."
XANDER,"(not looking up from his reading) Yeah, Anya can do it!"
ANYA,"Thanks, sweetie. (pats him on shoulder) Well said."
GILES,"Um, Anya, while, while I completely trust you uh, uh, to take care of the inventory and the money, um ... dealing with people requires a certain, uh ... finesse."
ANYA,"(angry) I have finesse! I have finesse coming out of my bottom! I can completely lie to the health inspector. I can, you know, distract him with coy smiles, and, and bribe him with money and goods."
XANDER,See there? She'll be great.
WILLOW,"Don't worry, Giles. I'll help her take care of everything. It'll be ship-shape. Better, it'll be shop-shape. (smiles)"
ANYA,"Xander, she's talking to Giles like I'm not here. Make her stop."
GILES,Perhaps I'd better call the airline...
WILLOW,"I'm just trying to help out! Xander, tell her. (smacks Xander in the arm)"
GILES,"...schedule an earlier flight back, excuse me."
ANYA,Tell her that I don't need her help.
XANDER,"(to Buffy) So, how goes the slaying?"
BUFFY,I killed something in a convent last night.
XANDER,"In any other room, a frightening declaration. Here, a welcome distraction. (Anya and Willow both look at him) Tell us all about the killing, Buff."
BUFFY,"Pretty standard. Vampire staking. Ooh! But I met a nun, and she let me try on her wimple."
XANDER,"Okay, now we're back to frightening."
Cut to,"exterior of the Summers house, night."
Cut to,"Joyce's bedroom. A light-blue bathrobe lies on the bed. Buffy enters, sees it, frowns, looks up."
BUFFY,You!
BUFFY,"You with the actual clothing, who are you? (turns toward Dawn's bedroom door) Dawn, come look at this."
JOYCE,"It's hard to recognize me, huh?"
DAWN,Whoa.
BUFFY,No more bathrobe.
JOYCE,"Hmm. I looked at it today, and there it was, all fuzzy and blue, (shot of the bathrobe) and I just couldn't stand it any more."
BUFFY,I don't think the rest of us will miss it much either.
DAWN,"It was getting a little ripe, Mom."
BUFFY,(to Dawn) Maybe we should burn it.
DAWN,It would keep the bugs away.
JOYCE,"It doesn't smell! Fine, fine, make your funny jokes at the expense of the woman with the hole in her skull. (Sits on the bed)"
BUFFY,(to Dawn) Let's go. I think we've tired her out.
DAWN,Whatcha doin'?
BUFFY,Playing soccer.
DAWN,Can I hang out in here?
BUFFY,Don't touch anything.
DAWN,You took down his pictures.
BUFFY,Yeah.
DAWN,"I ... I think I would've done that sooner. Like, boom! ""Don't wanna see that face again."""
BUFFY,"It wasn't like that. I was never angry with him. (sighs) Okay, that's a lie. But it's not like I don't want to see his face."
DAWN,"I was just starting to kinda like the guy, and then ... gone. So fast."
BUFFY,"It wasn't really so fast. Him leaving. According to everyone who isn't me, it was kind of gradual."
DAWN,Oh. Does that make it any better?
BUFFY,No.
DAWN,Because you should have noticed earlier?
BUFFY,Stop being insightful. It's creepy. (Dawn continues looking at her. Buffy speaks more softly.) It hurts. In all kinds of horrible ways. In the way where I'm furious at him ... in the way where I blame myself ... and all the little ways I imagine ... how I could have fixed things.
DAWN,It'll get better. (Frowns) Won't it?
BUFFY,"I hope so. Yes. It has to. (Dawn lies down, puts her head in Buffy's lap. Buffy strokes her hair) I'll just keep going like I have been, and every day it'll get a little bit better."
DAWN,Really? Every day?
BUFFY,Not really. But it'll be better soon.
DAWN,It still feels all sudden to me. With him gone where no one can talk to him.
BUFFY,But you never know. Maybe he'll come back. Maybe he'll hate the jungle ... or maybe he'll want to give it another try. I could ... say all the things I didn't get to say.
Cut to,Spike holding a box of chocolates. He talks to someone we can't see.
SPIKE,"(softly) Um ... there's something I got to tell you. About showing you Riley in that place.  (deep breath) I didn't mean to ... (long pause) Anyway, I know you're feeling all betrayed - by him, not me. (The camera pans around and we see he is talking to a mannequin, which has no legs but wears a blue blouse and a blonde wig. It's set up on a block of stone so that it is about Buffy's height.) I was trying to help, you know. Not like I made him be there, after all. Actually trying to help you. Best intentions."
SPIKE,"I mean, you know, pretty state you'd be in, thinking things are all right (moves back toward the mannequin) while he's toddling halfway round the bend. (Stares at the mannequin, gets madder) Oh, I'll insult him if I want to! I'm the one who's on your side! Me! Doing you a favor! (very angry) And you, being dead petty about it - me, getting nothing but your hatred and your venom and -  you ungrateful bitch!"
SPIKE,Bitch!
SPIKE,(quietly) Buffy ... there's something I wanted to tell you.
Cut to,"magic shop. Anya is working at the cash register. Willow stands behind her with her back to the camera, holding a book. Tara is standing by the shelves behind the register, where there are jars of magical supplies."
WILLOW,"Good, and, and hellebore. It's up and to the right."
TARA,"Hellebore, one of my favorites."
WILLOW,"It's powerful stuff. (She and Tara walk out from behind the counter) I tried to use it to de-rat Amy, and it didn't work. But I think it might have made her really smart. (They approach the table, where a variety of magical supplies are laid out. Willow puts the vial into a rack with some others.) She keeps giving me these looks like she's planning something. Rubbing her paws together."
ANYA,(annoyed) Hey. What are you two doing?
WILLOW,"Oh, we're gonna try out a few spells."
TARA,"There's this thing you can do where you create light, and we thought, what if you could make, like, simulated sunlight?"
WILLOW,"Yeah, so then, you know, there Buffy is, middle of the night, and she finds this whole nest of vamps, a-and then she just goes, ""Presto!"""
TARA,"Only it won't be ""presto"" exactly."
WILLOW,"And, and voom! There's a, a floating ball of sunlight. Vamps get dusty."
TARA,"You don't wanna look right at it, though."
ANYA,"That's swell, but you can't use this stuff. Giles has only been gone two days and you're already causing trouble. You shouldn't do things while he's gone."
WILLOW,(smiling) You're the fish!
ANYA,What?
WILLOW,"The, the fish in the bowl, in <I>The Cat in the Hat</I>. He was always saying that the cat shouldn't be there while the mother was out."
ANYA,What are you talking about?
TARA,It's a book. This cat does all this mischief.
WILLOW,"It's so cute. He balances a bunch of stuff, including that fish in the bowl! A-and, but don't try it for real when you're six, because then you're not allowed to have fish for five years."
ANYA,"(upset) You're referencing literature I have no way to be familiar with. You're trying to make me feel left out, and you're stealing!"
WILLOW,I'm not stealing. I-I'm just taking things without paying for th... (pauses) In what twisted dictionary is that stealing?
TARA,"Willow, maybe we should just pay."
WILLOW,"Anya, Giles would be totally fine with this. Come on, it'll be fun. (Gets an idea) We could show you how to do some stuff! You could be floatin' pencils by the end of the day."
ANYA,"Sometimes I miss having powers. (Willow grins. Anya realizes something) Oh. Oh! I know what this is! (shaking her finger at them) This is peer pressure! Any second now you're gonna make me smoke tobacco and, and have drugs."
WILLOW,Look how easy.
ANYA,Hey! Don't float the merchandise! (grabs the items and puts them back on the table)
ANYA,Stop that!
XANDER,"Hey, look at this, my two favorite girls! (to Tara) Three favorite girls."
ANYA,"Xander, Willow's stealing. She's a burglar."
WILLOW,"Right, the cunning, broad daylight in front of everyone burglar. Xander, I'm just doing a spell to help Buffy."
ANYA,"Xander, Giles left me in charge. Tell her."
XANDER,"Hey, hey, Judge Xander requesting a recess here."
TARA,You really shouldn't pull him into this.
XANDER,"Yeah, see? Tara's with me. (moves to stand behind Tara) Protect me, Tara."
WILLOW,"(walks back behind the counter, holding a mortar and pestle) Xander, what I'm doing, it's a good thing. And if it doesn't work, Giles never even needs to know about it."
WILLOW,Oops.
ANYA,The cash register! What did you do with the cash register? Dear god!
"WILLOW: I'll fix it, I'll fix it! <I>Recursat</I>. (latin translation",revert/return)
WILLOW,"There, all back. Good as new."
ANYA,Money. Did you hurt the money? (Opens the cash register and coughs as more smoke (not pink) comes out) Money good? (takes out some money and shakes it at Xander) She endangered the money! (Xander shrugs)
WILLOW,"Of course, that's what she cares about. (imitates Anya) ""I like money better than people. People can so rarely be exchanged for goods and/or services."""
ANYA,"(horrified) Xander, she's pretending to be me!"
WILLOW,"Well, can you even believe how she's acting?"
XANDER,"Okay, you know what? I'm tired of being the one in the middle. I'm not gonna let you pull me into this."
WILLOW,I'm not.
XANDER,"Whatever the issue is between you two, just figure it out without me."
ANYA,"Xander, don't go!"
WILLOW,(softly) You made him mad.
ANYA,(angrily) Me?!
WILLOW,"Tara, who do you think he was more mad at?"
TARA,"Um, you know? I think, uh, maybe, maybe you guys have some stuff you need to work out, you know, just really ... talk."
Cut to,"exterior of magic shop, day."
WILLOW,Fleabane... (measures some stuff into her mortar)
ANYA,Fifteen cents. (writes)
WILLOW,Salamander eyes... (puts them into the mortar)
ANYA,Ten bucks for twelve. Bargain. (writes)
WILLOW,Bindweed. (puts it in)
ANYA,"Ugh, ooh, that's a pricey one. (writes)"
WILLOW,Would you stop that? It's very distracting.
ANYA,Fine. Make your little ball of sunshine. I'll be quiet.
WILLOW,"Good, because this spell is very sensitive. Once I begin, any non-ritual word can disrupt it. (mashes the ingredients together with the pestle)"
ANYA,Fine.
WILLOW,"Okay, here we go."
ANYA,Did you start yet?
WILLOW,"(exhales loudly, turns to give Anya an annoyed look) Shh, no! This is it."
WILLOW,"Spirits of light, I invoke thee. Let the gloom of darkness part before you."
WILLOW,Let the moonlight be made pale by your presence. Spirits-
ANYA,Is it done?
WILLOW,Shh!!!
WILLOW,"Spirits of light, grant my wishes."
ANYA,"Sorry, I thought you were done."
WILLOW,(angry) Do you *wanna* screw this up?
ANYA,No. No. I'm sure you can do that all on your own.
WILLOW,"Hey Anya, whatever really has you mad, why don't you just say it, like you do every other thought that stomps through your brain?"
ANYA,(stands up) I believe I have said it.
WILLOW,No. You haven't. Come on. Let it out!
WILLOW,He's not a ball of sunshine.
BUFFY,"(sighs) New semester, new classes. (She and Tara begin to walk out into the hallway) Whole new vistas of knowledge to be confused and intimidated by."
TARA,"(laughs) I think this one's gonna be kind of fun. Greek Art's gonna touch on so many things -- mythology, history, philosophy..."
BUFFY,"(whispering) The professor spit too much when he talked. It was like being at Sea World. ""The first five rows will get wet."""
TARA,"(laughs) That was just, you know, um, enthusiasm."
BUFFY,It seemed very much like saliva.
TARA,We'll sit farther back next time.
BUFFY,"Good plan. (stops walking, folds the paper and puts it in her bag) I need to keep this course. The only other thing that fits into my schedule is Central American Geopolitics."
Tara,(grimaces) Hmm.
"BUFFY: And no, thank you. (resumes walking) I even hear the word jungle, all I can think of is him. (Tara looks sympathetic) You know, ""is that the one Riley's in?"" Really don't need a daily 2",00 knife in the heart.
TARA,Is it that bad?
BUFFY,"(stops walking) Sort of. But I'm starting to get perspective on the whole situation. You know, maybe Riley's ... where he's supposed to be. You know, maybe he needed ... to be where he was needed."
TARA,Willow says that things always happen for a reason.
BUFFY,But you ever notice people only say that about bad things? (Tara laughs) But not for me the furrowed brow. (resumes walking) What do you say we go pick up Willow and indulge ourselves in a little after-school hamburger?
TARA,"I guess we could. She might still be at the magic shop. I was there earlier, and she and Anya kinda got in this little squabble ... Xander and I sort of cleared out, he was pretty upset."
BUFFY,"(stops walking, looks very concerned) Anya and, and Xander are in trouble?"
TARA,"Oh! No, I-I said that all wrong. It was nothing. Willow and Anya were sort of fighting, and then Xander kind of snapped at both of them and he left."
BUFFY,(alarmed) He left? Xander left Anya?
TARA,"(frowning) Ummm ... no, not ""left her"" left her, he just left. It was only a little thing, it-"
BUFFY,"Little thing? (tearfully) See, the thing is, the ... little things get bigger, you know, and, and, and, and, if you don't catch the little thing and then, boom! You have this, this, this whole huge thing!"
TARA,Oh dear.
BUFFY,"(sniffling) Not, not, not them with the little things! They can't break up!"
TARA,"Oh, I think-"
BUFFY,They have a beautiful love.
TARA,I think they'll be fine.
BUFFY,(muffled) They have a miraculous love!
TARA,What?
BUFFY,(sobbing) A miraculous love!
Cut to,Giles's convertible zooming down the streets of Sunnydale. We see another car by the side of the road with its side all smashed in.
ANYA,"There, that parked car! We're still on his trail."
WILLOW,"I don't even get how we made that guy, because, wow, advanced! (She continues looking through the papers)"
ANYA,"No one made him. He must have been trapped in that crystal, and you released him."
WILLOW,"*I* released him? No, this was definitely a ""we"" thing. Or, or a ""you"" thing! I-it definite feels like a you thing."
ANYA,"Look, just find the reversal spell. And hurry! Look what he did to that lamppost!"
WILLOW,"I'm trying. Put the top up, the pages are all blowy!"
ANYA,"Well, I don't know how to put the top up, I only just figured out what the left pedal does. (turns to smile at Willow) It makes us stop!"
WILLOW,You don't know how to drive? Why didn't you say you don't know how to drive?
ANYA,"Well, I couldn't know if I could until I tried, could I?"
WILLOW,"This is very, very bad. There, there's an ogre on the loose-"
ANYA,Troll.
WILLOW,What?
ANYA,"Troll on the loose. Now hold on, I'm gonna press the right pedal harder. (smiling) I expect us to accelerate."
WILLOW,"(yelling over the engine noise) There's a troll on the loose, and you're gonna crash Giles' car!"
ANYA,(agreeing) It's likely. We're going very fast. You should have listened to me and not done the spell. Giles put me in charge.
WILLOW,"Giles can be an idiot. The smart kind, but still."
ANYA,Xander agreed.
WILLOW,"Oh, right. Xander doesn't step out of line."
ANYA,"(turns to look at her) Well, what do you mean by that?"
WILLOW,Nothing.
ANYA,Find that spell quickly!
WILLOW,"Whoa, that's gone."
Cut to,"interior of the Bronze. Xander takes a bowl of peanuts from the counter and turns away. As he walks away he bumps into Spike, who is drinking a mug of beer."
SPIKE,"Hey, watch it. (looks at Xander) Oh, it's you."
XANDER,"Spike, don't let me stop you from not being here."
SPIKE,"I was here first, you know."
XANDER,Uh-huh. Go away.
SPIKE,"Now why would I do that, when it's bugging you so much having me here?"
SPIKE,They have chicken wings too. Also a sort of a flower-shaped thing they make from an onion. It's brilliant.
XANDER,Are you talking to me hoping that I'll get so depressed that I'll impale myself on a fork right in front of you?
SPIKE,"Lovely thought. If I don't hurt you myself, the chip wouldn't zap me. I could eat you that way. Beat the onion thing all to hell."
XANDER,Hey! Those are mine.
SPIKE,"My, my. Someone's in a temper. (sits down opposite Xander) This all sympathetic misery borrowed from the Slayer?"
XANDER,"What? No, nothing to do with Buffy."
SPIKE,"So she's all right then. Not, uh ... holding grudges."
XANDER,What are you talking about? What does Buffy have to do with anything? What grudges?
SPIKE,"Oh, yeah. Okay. No need to talk about her then. I'm sure she's merrily slaying some pals of mine, having a grand old time."
BUFFY VOICEOVER,This is very bad.
Cut to,interior of magic shop. Buffy steps around the broken debris lying on the floor.
BUFFY,(calling) Willow? Anya?
TARA,"They're not back there either, they're gone. (anxious) Buffy, something's been here and Willow's gone."
BUFFY,"Don't worry. We'll get her back, I promise. (Tara nods) Come on, this thing's probably leaving a huge trail."
Cut to,"city street, night. Olaf comes round a corner with his hammer. He uses it to hit a large dumpster, which goes spinning across the street toward a bunch of passers-by. The people stare. Olaf laughs loudly."
OLAF,Puny receptacle!
OLAF,"Rrrah! You do well to flee, townspeople! I will pillage your lands and dwellings! (The people begin to run away) I will burn your crops and make merry sport with your more attractive daughters! Ha ha ha! Mark my words!"
OLAF,Ooh! Ale! I smell delicious ale!
Cut to,interior of the Bronze. Spike and Xander are playing pool together.
XANDER,"And they get in these fights, and they're both looking at me like I'm the referee. Also, sometimes I'll say something about Anya, and Willow'll get this look, this, um, ""what the hell do you see in her"" look."
SPIKE,"I know that look. Lot of people never really got Dru, you know."
XANDER,"Well, she was insane. (Spike looks offended) Then it's like, well, I get all torn. Because, Willow's my best friend and I really value her opinion, but, uh, Anya's my girlfriend, you know?"
SPIKE,Hmm. What does the Slayer think of all this ... friction in the ranks? (walks around the pool table to study the angles) Can't be good for morale.
XANDER,I don't know.
SPIKE,"(bitterly) She's a little ... preoccupied, maybe. It's understandable what with all the upset, all the blaming of innocent bystanders who got caught up in the mess."
XANDER,What?
SPIKE,"(walks closer to Xander) I mean, did she *want* to be made a fool of? And, what does a person have to do to make it right? (Olaf walks past, bumping Spike's shoulder) Hey, watch it, mate."
SPIKE,"On second thought, do what you like."
OLAF,Ale! Yes!
OLAF,"Ah, fragrant ale!"
XANDER,"(still standing behind Spike) So, uh ... think I should run and get Buffy?"
OLAF,"Barmaid! Bring me stronger ale, and some plump, succulent babies to eat."
XANDER,I'm gonna run and get Buffy. (Pats Spike on the shoulder) Or maybe you could fight him.
SPIKE,"Yeah, I could do that, but I'm paralyzed with not caring very much."
OLAF,(pointing at Spike) You there! (walks up to Spike and Xander) Do you know where there are babies?
SPIKE,"(to Xander) What do you think, the hospital?"
XANDER,What? Shut up! (to Olaf) Um ... listen...
OLAF,I find myself very hungry. And when I'm hungry I grow short of patience.
XANDER,"Well, we can take care of the hungry, so how's about you just sit down in one of the ... sturdier chairs, and we can ... have a calm talk and something to eat."
OLAF,Can it be babies?
XANDER,"Well, not so much."
OLAF,(disappointed) Oh.
XANDER,"But maybe ... some roast pigs, and ... stags, and ... much hearty grog. (grins nervously)"
SPIKE,They've got this onion thing...
OLAF,You cannot appease me! Do not try! (turns away) More ale!
ANYA,Xander! You shouldn't be here. There's a troll. (She goes over to him and they put their arms around each other)
XANDER,"Uh, a big guy? Hammer? (Anya nods) I think I noticed him. (points)"
WILLOW,I wish Buffy was here.
BUFFY,I'm here.
WILLOW,I wish I had a million dollars. (The others look at her) Just checking.
BUFFY,(looks at Olaf) What's going on? Where did he come from?
SPIKE,"Hello, Buffy."
ANYA,(still holding on to Xander) Willow stole ingredients and released him from a purple crystal. He's a troll.
BUFFY,(to Willow) You did this?
WILLOW,"Me? No, we. I mean, us. (points to Anya) Uh, her. It's very complex."
ANYA,"Well, we can stop him. Willow, do the spell."
WILLOW,"Uh, let the conjuring be-"
OLAF,Stop!
WILLOW,Nobody lets me finish!
OLAF,"You ... told the witch to do that, Anyanka. (Anya looks alarmed) You seem determined to put an end to all my fun. Just like you always did when we were dating!"
ANYA,"Uh, um..."
XANDER,You dated him?
BUFFY,You dated a troll?
WILLOW,"And we're what, surprised by this?"
ANYA,"Well, he wasn't a troll then! You know, he was just a big dumb guy, and ... well, you know, he cheated on me and I made him into a troll, which by the way is... (embarrassed) how I got the ... job as a vengeance demon."
OLAF,"I did not cheat! Not in my heart. It was only one wench! I, I had had a great deal of mead! Next thing I know, I'm a troll! Ohh ... ohh ... you did this, Anyanka. You will die for this."
XANDER,"But, but, you seem to enjoy the, the being a troll."
OLAF,"(shrugs) I adjusted. And then what happened? Witches. (Willow looks offended) Filthy, dirty, disgusting witches. They trapped me. I was imprisoned in that crystal for centuries. Ohh, a curse on all witches! All must die!"
BUFFY,"(to Willow) Willow, again."
WILLOW,"Uh, uh, (looks at book) Let the conjuring be undone. Return the beast to native form."
OLAF,"comes toward them) Witch, you must stop!"
WILLOW,(quickly) Keep it far from us and ours as long as my voice shall sound.
OLAF,(laughs) It did not work!
WILLOW,"Okay, wait! Uh, ""Let the conjuring-"""
BUFFY,Where is he?
WILLOW,Gone.
BUFFY,"Xander, follow him. (Xander nods) Anya, Willow, head back to the magic shop, find a spell that will actually stop him."
BUFFY,What are you doing?
SPIKE,"Making this woman more comfortable. (looks up at Buffy) I'm not sampling, I'll have you know. (looks around) Just look at all these lovely blood-covered people. I could, but not a taste for Spike, not a lick. Know you wouldn't like it."
BUFFY,(amazed) You want credit for not feeding on bleeding disaster victims?
SPIKE,"Well, yeah."
BUFFY,You're disgusting. (Walks away)
SPIKE,"(to himself) What's it take? (sighs, continues helping the injured woman)"
Cut to,interior of the magic shop. Willow is looking at bookshelves.
WILLOW,"Hurry up! I'm taking everything on relocation spells, suspension spells, and, what the heck, spells to make him really sleepy, 'cause, slightly better."
ANYA,"In case we need 'em, I'm getting more of all the things you stole."
WILLOW,I didn't - why do you do that?
ANYA,What? (Goes back to the counter for more stuff)
WILLOW,"You're so rude! I mean, sure, at first, ex-demon, doesn't know the rules. Well, you been here forever. Learn the rules."
ANYA,(putting more stuff on table) Rules are stupid.
WILLOW,"Great, whatever. (they both sit down and open books) I just thought you might be interested in learning to act more human. Some of us enjoy it. Oh, look for, uh, spells with dimensional portals too."
ANYA,I *am* a human. And there are ... many humans who are stranger than me.
WILLOW,"Uh-huh, but, unless I'm really wrong about crazy Larry down at the bus stop, he's probably not gonna turn Xander into a troll."
ANYA,"Well, now, that's a very complicated proced... (pauses) Oh. You think I'm gonna hurt Xander? I would *never* hurt Xander! (Willow looks skeptical) You really think I would do that!"
WILLOW,"Anya, it's what you do. You spent what, a thousand years hurting men? You got your ""thousand years of hurting men"" gold watch."
ANYA,"I was a demon then, and, and I don't even have any powers now! Is this the spell? (holds a book up)"
WILLOW,"(looks) Only if you want him to double in size, and grow extra arms, which ... let's not. A-and by the way, you weren't a demon when you turned Olaf into Lord of the Hammers. You managed that. (Anya continues looking at the book) Also, there's ... other ways to hurt Xander."
ANYA,"I don't do magic now. You're the one with that kind of power. In fact, D'Hoffryn offered you my old job. You're closer to being a vengeance demon than I am, maybe Xander should be afraid of you."
WILLOW,Xander's my best friend!
ANYA,"Oh, and you don't want anyone else to have him. I know what broke up him and Cordelia, you know. It was you! And your lips!"
WILLOW,"No it was not! Well, yes it was so, but ... that was a long time ago. Do you think I'd do that again?"
ANYA,Why not?
WILLOW,"Well, hello, gay now."
ANYA,"But you're always doing everything you can to, to point out how much I'm an outsider. You've known him since you were squalling infants together. You'll always know him better than I do. You could sweep in and, and poison his mind against me."
WILLOW,You're insane! I am not gonna take him away and I am not gonna hurt him.
ANYA,"Well, I'm not either!"
OLAF,Aha!
OLAF,"I knew it. You two, performing more spells. I could be out pillaging, devouring babies, making merry with the local virgins, but instead, I had to come all the way back here to kill you."
WILLOW,Run!
XANDER,"No, get away from them!"
OLAF,"(turns to laugh at Xander) I will get away from them, after I kill them."
XANDER,You are not touching these women.
OLAF,"Ah, you wish for more? Admirable!"
OLAF,"You fight well, although you are a tiny man. (lifts Xander to his feet) I shall reward you. Only one of your women shall die, (shot of Anya and Willow still lying on the floor) and you shall be the one to choose."
WILLOW,Did he just say-
OLAF,"Ha ha. Choose! (gestures at them with one arm, the other arm around Xander's shoulders) Anyanka or the witch. One of your women must die."
XANDER,"No. You are one crazy troll, I ... I'm not choosing between my girlfriend and my best friend. That's insane troll logic."
ANYA,Go Xander. I love you.
OLAF,"(laughs, shakes Xander by the shoulders) Good for you. You are a loyal man."
WILLOW,Xander!
OLAF,Now. Choose!
ANYA,"Olaf, no!"
XANDER,(still bending over in pain) I'm not choosing.
OLAF,"Then you shall be the one who dies. (Lifts his hammer with one hand, holds Xander by the hair with the other)"
ANYA,(rushes forward) No! (Olaf looks at her) Choose me! Just don't take him! Don't take Xander!
WILLOW: <I>E conspectu abeat monstrum</I> (translation,"""let the monster be gone from sight""). (The cash register disappears) Damn."
ANYA,Buffy!
WILLOW,"Tara, stay back!"
ANYA,"Buffy, the hammer! The strength's in the hammer!"
ANYA,How can I help?
WILLOW,"Uh, distract him from Buffy, (shot of Buffy and Olaf grappling over the hammer again) uh, piss him off."
ANYA,I don't know how.
WILLOW,"Anya, I have faith in you. There is no one you cannot piss off."
ANYA,Hey Olaf! You're as inadequate a troll as you were a boyfriend!
ANYA,"Uh, y-you're hairy, and unattractive, and even women trolls are put off by your various odors."
"WILLOW: (muttering) <I>Instrumentum ultionis, telum fabuloso, surge, surge, terram pro voca</I>. (translation","""Instrument of revenge, fabled weapon, arise, arise,"" ??)"
ANYA,Your menacing stance is merely alarming!
ANYA,And your roar is less than full-throated!
OLAF,"Desist! (stomps toward Anya) My god, woman, it's been a thousand years, and yet you are as aggravating and emasculating as ever you were."
"WILLOW: Vola cum viribus, dominum tuum nega. Vola! (translation","""I wish with all men, that god will deny you."")"
ANYA,"Hey, good job."
WILLOW,"You too, very irritating."
BUFFY,(confronting Olaf) So. Your power's in your hammer?
ANYA,"(calls to Buffy) Oh, yeah! I forgot he still has all that troll strength."
OLAF,You shall all die! I will dispense no mercy now!
OLAF,"What are you fighting for, minuscule blonde one? Your friends? (gestures to Anya comforting Xander) These two? (chuckles) They will never last. (Buffy's lower lip begins to tremble) Anyanka is very difficult to live with, and he... (we see Willow and Anya both comforting Xander) he's ludicrous and far too breakable. Their love will never last."
WILLOW,She's got him now.
ANYA,Poor baby.
XANDER,You really dated him?
ANYA,(grimaces) Yes.
XANDER,"But you like me better, right?"
ANYA,"(smiles) Yes! Oh, and Willow likes you too, but not in a sexy way, you know, 'cause she's gay. (Willow smiles at Xander) And she's not gonna try to break us up, so, you know, it's all okay."
BUFFY,"(OS) Their love... (punching noise, Olaf grunts) will last ... (punch, grunt) forever! (punch, sound of Olaf falling to the floor)"
WILLOW,Let the transposition be complete.
BUFFY,(OS) Where did you send him?
ANYA,(OS) The land of the trolls.
ANYA,He'll like it there. Full of trolls.
WILLOW,"It's hard to be precise, though. Alternate universes don't stay put. Trying to send him to a specific place is sort of like ... like ... trying to hit a ... puppy, by throwing a live bee at it. (They all look at her) Which is a weird image, and you should all just forget it."
ANYA,"It's possible that he's in the land of perpetual Wednesday ... or the crazy melty land ... or, you know, the world without shrimp."
TARA,There's a world without shrimp? (Willow looks at her) I'm allergic.
WILLOW,"He, he's probably in troll land."
BUFFY,"I only care that he's not here, and I got this nifty souvenir."
BUFFY,Oops.
XANDER,The place is trashed enough anyway.
BUFFY,"Well, see how well things worked out? (looks fondly at Anya and Xander) And look at you guys. So good and alive and together. (starts to tear up again) So together, and ... good, and ... alive... (sniffles, turns to grab a tissue) Oh, god... (crying) I'm ... I'm just so happy for you..."
Cut to,Buffy and Giles sitting at the table in the Summers dining room.
GILES,I cringe to think what the place would have looked like if I'd been away for longer than three days.
BUFFY,"Well, maybe we would have had time to clean it up. You know, if Willow used some magicks to help."
GILES,"Yes, 'cause nothing could possibly go wrong with that."
JOYCE,"Rupert, I still don't understand - (Giles gets up and takes the tray) oh, thank you - why the other Watchers made you go all the way to England when they don't know anything."
GILES,"(passing out mugs) Well, they don't know it ... yet. I mean, they have no record of, of Glory or anyone like her, but, uh, based on the information that I've given them, they're gonna look into it. Um, they might have something soon."
BUFFY,What about the key? Were they all over it?
GILES,"(warily) Yes. (to Joyce) You, you know all of this?"
JOYCE,"I got some of it myself, Buffy told me the rest."
GILES,"(pouring tea) Well, they're interested, certainly, and, uh, full of theories. (Sits back, lifting his cup) Most of them ... nonsensical."
BUFFY,(OS) They don't know that it's Dawn.
GILES,(OS) No.
JOYCE,"I still can't begin to grasp this. I mean, she's my little girl, I..."
GILES,(OS) It is disorienting.
BUFFY,"(OS) Giles, what happens if they figure it out? What would they do?"
GILES,(OS) I don't know.
JOYCE,"Oh, I can't even think about this. It's too ... I'll get some more milk."
