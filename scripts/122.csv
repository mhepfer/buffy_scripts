BUFFY,Giles?
ANYA,Giles?
WILLOW,(O.S.) Uh oh.
WILLOW,(sarcastic) Daddy's home. I'm in wicked trouble now.
GILES,You have no idea. (Willow sitting up) You have to stop what you're doing.
WILLOW,"(fake smile) Uhh, sorry. Can't do that. (Giles walking closer) I'm not finished yet."
GILES,Neither am I. Stay down.
ANYA,(softly to Giles) How'd you do that?
WILLOW,(small laugh) That's borrowed power. No way is it gonna be strong enough-
GILES,I'm here to help you.
WILLOW,"(rolling eyes) Thanks, but I can kill a couple geeks all by myself. (Giles walking slowly closer) But, hey, if you'd like to watch ... I mean, that's what you Watchers are good at, right? Watching? Butting in on things that don't concern you?"
GILES,"You concern me, Willow. Stay on this path and you'll wind up dead."
BUFFY,Willow. Listen to him. I don't want to fight you anymore.
WILLOW,I don't want to fight you either. (looking at Giles) I wanna fight him.
GILES,Stay down.
WILLOW,No.
WILLOW,"Remember that little spat we had before you left? (shot of Anya watching nervously) When you were under the delusion that you were still relevant here? (walking closer) You called me a rank, arrogant amateur. Well buckle up, Rupert..."
WILLOW,(deep resonant voice) 'Cause I've turned pro.
WILLOW,"Asmodea, bring forth--"
GILES,(gesturing) <i>Vincire!</i>
WILLOW,"What? No! Get off! (struggling) <i>Solvo, libero</i>..."
BUFFY,What did you do?
GILES,Contained her and her powers within a binding field. It puts her in a kind of ... stasis for the time-
GILES,You cut your hair.
ANYA,I'm blonde.
ANYA,"I, I colored my hair. (pauses) Again. I'm blonde."
GILES,"Yes, I noticed."
GILES,I'm very sorry about Tara.
WILLOW,This...
WILLOW,...won't hold me ... forever.
GILES,I came as soon as I heard.
BUFFY,The Council?
GILES,"The Council haven't a clue. About much of anything, really. (walking toward Buffy, leaning on the horse) No, there's an ... an extremely powerful coven in Devon. They sensed the rise of a dangerous magical force here in Sunnydale. A dark force, fueled by grief."
BUFFY,Willow.
GILES,I'd so hoped it wasn't her. (pauses) And then a seer in the coven told me about Tara. That's when the coven ... imbued me with their powers.
BUFFY,And sent you here to bring Willow down.
GILES,"(looks at her) Buffy, what's happened here?"
BUFFY,(pacing) God. I don't even know where to start.
GILES,"Well, Willow's clearly been abusing the magicks."
BUFFY,"(nods) She has. She was ... and I barely even noticed. Giles, everything's just been so... (sighs) Xander left Anya at the altar, and Anya's a vengeance demon again... (Giles looking shocked) Dawn's a total klepto ... money's been so tight that I've been slinging burgers at the Doublemeat Palace ... (looks down at the floor) And I've been sleeping with Spike."
GILES,(trying to calm down) Sorry.
WILLOW,(telepathically) Anya...
ANYA,Willow.
WILLOW,"(telepathically) I need you, Anya. I need you to do something for me."
ANYA,"I know what you're trying to do. And I hate to burst your bubble, but that mind control mojo doesn't work on vengeance demons, so why don't you just-"
WILLOW,(telepathically) Stop talking and listen.
ANYA,(nods) Okay.
WILLOW,(telepathically)You need to free me.
ANYA,(uncertain) No.
WILLOW,(telepathically) You don't want to call out to them. (Anya stops) You want to take away this binding spell.
ANYA,(turns back toward Willow) I don't know how.
WILLOW,(telepathically) I do. Do you want me to tell you?
GILES,(laughing) Duct tape?
BUFFY,(laughing) On their mouths. So the demon could eat them...
GILES,Because they were figments.
BUFFY,"All of it! You, Sunnydale ... And I was just some nutcase in L.A."
GILES,(still laughing) Of course. Why didn't we see it before?
BUFFY,For what?
GILES,I should never have left.
BUFFY,No. You were right to leave. We're just ... stupid.
GILES,I know you're all stupid. (Buffy smiling) I should never have abandoned you.
BUFFY,"No. Giles, you were right about everything. It is time I was an adult."
GILES,Sometimes the most adult thing you can do is ... ask for help when you need it.
BUFFY,Now you tell me.
BUFFY,"(quietly) I guess ... I wasn't ready before. It took a long time for that feeling to go away ... the feeling that I wasn't really here. It was like ... when I clawed my way out of that grave, I left something behind. Part of me. I just... (pauses, looks Giles in the eye) I don't understand ... why I'm back."
GILES,You have a calling.
BUFFY,"But it was my time, Giles. Someone would have taken my place. (Giles grimacing) So why?"
BUFFY,Right. (sighs) What's gonna happen to Willow?
GILES,"Well, the coven is working on a ... way to extract her powers without ... killing her. And, uh, should she survive, you ought to know, Buffy, that there's no guarantee she'll ... be as she was. (Buffy looking concerned) Willow has killed a human being. How will she be able to live with herself?"
WILLOW,(O.S.) I wouldn't worry about that.
WILLOW,Willow doesn't live here anymore.
GILES,<i>Vincire!</i>
WILLOW,<i>Solutum.</i>
WILLOW,(small smile) Fool me once...
GILES,Willow...
WILLOW,(shaking a finger) Shame on you.
GILES,<i>Excudo!</i>
Cut to,"exterior residential street, night. Dawn and Xander walk along, with Jonathan and Andrew behind them."
DAWN,Where are we going?
XANDER,I have no idea.
DAWN,What?
XANDER,"I don't know, okay? I can't even run away well. And that's something I'm usually good at."
DAWN,Maybe we should we go back and help.
XANDER,"Yeah, 'cause I've been such a big help already. Standing around like a monkey while Buffy gets shot. Tara's dead ... and Willow ... losing..."
DAWN,"(annoyed) Well, feeling sorry for yourself isn't helping either, Xander, okay?"
DAWN,"You know, if Spike were here, he'd go back and fight."
XANDER,"Sure, if he wasn't too busy trying to rape your sister."
DAWN,What?!
XANDER,Forget it.
DAWN,(following) I don't believe you.
XANDER,Fine.
DAWN,(uncertain) He wouldn't do that.
XANDER,Is this blind spot like a genetic trait with the Summers women? The only useful thing Spike ever did was finally leave town.
SPIKE,"Well, that was a bloody doddle and piece o'piss."
SPIKE,"Got any more ruddy tests for me, you ponce? I'll take anything you can throw at me, if it'll get me what I need to take care of the Slayer. Give her what's coming to her. (sniffs angrily) So you just bring it on. Bring on the whole-"
SPIKE,Bloody hell.
Cut to,"magic shop, main room. The pillar is lying on the floor and furniture, sparking occasionally with electricity. Pan slowly across the wreckage of the shop, which has taken quite a beating from all the fighting."
WILLOW,"That all you got, Jeeves?"
WILLOW,"'Cause, I could stand to go another ten rounds. Whereas ... you can barely stand."
GILES,(wearily) Your powers ... may be undeniably greater. But I can still hurt you if I have to.
WILLOW,"Boy, you just don't get it, do you? Nothing can hurt me now."
WILLOW,This?
WILLOW,...is nothing. It's all ... nothing.
GILES,I see. If you lose someone you love ... the other people in your life who care about you...
GILES,...become meaningless. I wonder what Tara would say about that.
WILLOW,(grimly) You can ask her yourself.
WILLOW,You're always saving everyone. It's kinda pesky.
WILLOW,"You probably even think you're buying escape time for Jonathan and the other one. Well, I got a little secret for ya. (Buffy looking upset) I can kill them from anywhere I want. (looking at the ball of flame) With this."
WILLOW,It'll find them. It'll bury them. (Giles lifting his head painfully) Along with anyone helping those Dead Men Walking.
BUFFY,Don't.
WILLOW,"(mockingly) Unless ... somebody, somehow ... can get there in time to save them. (pause) Huh. Oh, well."
WILLOW,"Fly, my pretty, fly."
WILLOW,"(to Buffy, smiling) See what I did there?"
GILES,Go.
WILLOW,Good luck.
WILLOW,Thought she'd never leave. (walking toward him) Now I finally have you all to myself.
WILLOW,"You're such a hypocrite. Waltzing in here with your borrowed magicks. So you can tell me what? Magic's bad? Behave? Be a good girl? (chuckles) Well, I ... I don't think you're in any position to be telling me what to do."
WILLOW,Do you?
WILLOW,(scornful) I used to think you had all the answers. That I had so much to learn from you.
GILES,Willow...
WILLOW,(looking up at him) You were jealous. Still are. Just couldn't bear that I was the one with power. That's why you ran away.
GILES,<i>Incurso!</i>
WILLOW,That's why you-
WILLOW,(panting) That ... was rude! Now I forgot what I was saying.
GILES,(painfully) Perhaps you're not as strong ... as you think you are.
GILES,You're expending way too much of your mystical energy to maintain your powers. At this rate you're going to ... burn out. And up.
WILLOW,(annoyed) Blah blah blah.
GILES,"(on his knees) Willow, you ... you need to stop."
WILLOW,What I need...
WILLOW,...is a little pick-me-up.
WILLOW,Whoa. Head rush.
WILLOW,Wow. Whoa. Who's your supplier? This is ... wow.
WILLOW,"It's incredible. (panting) I mean, I am so juiced ... Giles, it's like ... no ... mortal person has ... ever had ... this much power. Ever. It's like I, I'm connected to everything ... I can feel ... it feels like ... I ... I can feel..."
WILLOW,"...everyone. Oh. Oh my God. All the emotion. All the pain. No, it, it's too much. It's just too much."
GILES,(weakly) Willow ... It doesn't have to be ... like that. You ... you can stop it.
WILLOW,"(panting) Yeah. I, I can. I have to stop this. (getting up) I'll make it go away."
GILES,Willow...
WILLOW,"Oh, you poor bastards!"
WILLOW,Your suffering has to end.
GILES,No....
XANDER,(O.S.) Ow. (kicks again) Ow.
JONATHAN,Ow! Son of a bitch!
ANDREW,Buttwipe!
JONATHAN,I wasn't talking to you.
ANDREW,Oh. Reflex.
XANDER,"(still kicking) Man, they've really tightened security up here lately. One too many squatters from the Hellmouth."
ANDREW,(sarcastic) Hide out in the cemetery. What a fantastic idea.
XANDER,"Yeah, I'm working on a whole ""shut the hell up"" pitch you might like too."
DAWN,(noticing something above and behind them) Xander?
XANDER,(to Andrew) I've had just about as much as I can stand baby-sitting a couple of social retards who don't appreciate-
DAWN,Xander!
XANDER,What?
DAWN,What is that?
BUFFY,(O.S.) Get out of there!
BUFFY,Move!
BUFFY,"Dawn! Dawn, hold on."
JONATHAN,"Mexico, huh?"
ANYA,Giles.
ANYA,Giles!
GILES,Anya.
ANYA,(upset) I'm so sorry. Willow forced me to free her with her brain. Are you okay?
GILES,I can see...
ANYA,(uncertain) Oh. It's a ... miracle.
GILES,"Willow ... I can see her. She took the magic I had and ... now ... I know where she is. I can feel what ... Oh, God."
ANYA,Giles ... you have to rest.
GILES,Silly girl. I'm dying.
ANYA,(alarmed) No you're not.
GILES,It was ... It was the only way. I thought we ... there'd be a chance ... now ... I know where Willow is. She's going to finish it.
ANYA,Finish what?
GILES,The world.
Cut to,shot of the sun rising through clouds.
Cut to,"shot of the hole in the ground in the cemetery, the morning sunshine lighting it."
Cut to,close shot of hands clutching the tree roots that line the edges of the hole.
DAWN,Buffy!
DAWN,Are you okay?
BUFFY,We have to get out of here. (yells) Xander!
DAWN,I think I saw him hit his head.
BUFFY,(yells) Xander!
DAWN,"This looks a little like Spike's place. You know, under his crypt."
DAWN,What are you doing?
BUFFY,"If we can pull these out, we can use the coffins for height. (tugging) Maybe get out of here!"
DAWN,"Maybe one of the tunnels Spike uses is around here. Uh, we could use it to get to his place."
BUFFY,(digging) That's the last place on Earth we need to be.
DAWN,"(annoyed) Oh, but it was good enough for you to take me there after what he did to you."
BUFFY,What he...
DAWN,Tried to do. Whatever.
BUFFY,"(realizing, annoyed) Xander."
DAWN,So it's true?
BUFFY,"Dawn, you may not have noticed, we're in really big trouble here. This isn't-"
DAWN,Why did you not tell me?
BUFFY,Because you didn't need to know.
DAWN,"Yes, I do. I need to know! I'm not a kid anymore."
BUFFY,"(angry) Dawn, I'm trying to protect you."
DAWN,"(angry) Well, you can't! Look around, Buffy. We're trapped in here! Willow's killing and people I love keep dying! And you cannot protect me from that."
BUFFY,(whispers) Dawn...
XANDER,(O.S.) Hello?
BUFFY,(calls) Xander?
XANDER,"Buffy, you okay? Where's Dawn?"
DAWN,Here.
BUFFY,Are Jonathan and Andrew up there with you?
XANDER,"No, they musta skedaddled when I was out. Weasels. Whoa!"
BUFFY,"Xander, you've gotta find some kind of rope or something and get us out of here."
XANDER,"(looking around) Right. Okay, I'll, uh, I'll take a look around."
BUFFY,And hurry up before-
ANYA,(looking around) Holy frijole!
BUFFY,Anya! What are you doing here? Where's Giles?
DAWN,Giles?
ANYA,He's still at the magic shop.
DAWN,Giles is back? (Buffy rolling her eyes) You didn't tell me that.
BUFFY,(to Anya) Did he stop Willow?
ANYA,No. And things just got a whole lot worse.
BUFFY,How worse?
ANYA,End of the world worse. Willow's going to destroy it.
DAWN,(amazed) She can do that?
ANYA,She can and she will when she gets to where she's going.
BUFFY,Where's she going?
ANYA,Big old Satanic temple. Kingman's Bluff?
BUFFY,There's ... no temple on Kingman's Bluff.
BUFFY,(O.S.) Proserpexa?
BUFFY,Who's she?
ANYA,"Uh, way up there in the hierarchy of she-demons. Her followers intended to use her effigy to destroy the world. They all died when the temple got swallowed up in the big earthquake of '32."
BUFFY,"So now seventy years later, Willow's going to make their dreams come true."
ANYA,"She's going to drain the planet's life force, and funnel its energy through Proserpexa's effigy and, and burn the Earth to a cinder. (Dawn looking at Buffy in alarm)"
BUFFY,Not if I can help it.
ANYA,You can't.
BUFFY,What does that mean?
ANYA,"Don't know. He, he said, ""the Slayer can't stop her,"" and then he said a bunch of other stuff. (anxiously) He really wasn't too clear."
BUFFY,"Anya, what are you-"
ANYA,(nervous) I ... I should get back to him. He's alone.
BUFFY,(worried) Is he okay?
ANYA,Don't think he ... has a lot of time left. (Dawn gasping) I'm sorry.
BUFFY,Xander! Where is that rope?!
DAWN,Buffy...
BUFFY,Xander! (quieter) Where is he?
DAWN,(upset) You heard what Anya said ... you hear what Giles said.
BUFFY,"I heard. (upset) And I don't care, I have to try..."
WILLOW,From the pit of forgotten shadows...
Willow's and Buffy's lines overlap,
BUFFY,I'm not just gonna sit here while Willow incinerates what I'm chosen to protect.
WILLOW,"Awaken, sister of the dark, awaken-"
BUFFY,I have to stop her.
WILLOW,Always the Slayer...
WILLOW,(O.S.) Right to the last.
BUFFY,(uncertain) Willow?
WILLOW,"And it is the last, you know? For all your fighting ... thinking you're saving the world..."
DAWN,Buffy?
WILLOW,And in the end ... I'm the only one that can save it.
BUFFY,By killing us?
WILLOW,It's the only way to stop the pain.
WILLOW,"(O.S.) I can't take it anymore. But I know you, Buffy."
WILLOW,You're a warrior. You won't go out without a fight. I don't really have time for one. But you should go out fighting.
BUFFY,"Willow, what are you-"
WILLOW,"It was me that took you out of the Earth. Well, now..."
WILLOW,...the Earth wants you back.
DAWN,Buffy!
BUFFY,They just keep coming. I can't take them all.
BUFFY,Dawn. Will you help me?
DAWN,I got your back.
WILLOW,Proserpexa ... let the cleansing fires from the depths burn away the suffering souls and bring sweet death.
BUFFY,Willow...
ANYA,"Giles? Giles! Don't die. (tearfully) Not yet, there-there are things I wanna tell you."
ANYA,Thanks a lot for coming. It was good of you to teleport all this way.
ANYA,"Though in retrospect, it probably would have been better if you hadn't come and given Willow all that magic that made her like ten times more powerful. (sadly) That would have been a plus."
XANDER,"Hey, black-eyed girl. Whatcha doin'?"
WILLOW,Get out of here.
XANDER,"Ah, no. You're not the only one with powers, you know. You may be a hopped-up uber-witch, but ... this carpenter can dry-wall you into the next century."
WILLOW,"I'm not joking, Xander. Get out of my way. Now."
Cut to,"close-up on Giles's face, still bloody, still lying on the magic shop floor. His eyes pop open."
GILES,(whispers) There...
ANYA,What?
GILES,(whispers) It's not over.
BUFFY,Dawn! I'm coming!
DAWN,"(holding up the sword, tiny smile) What? You think I never watched you?"
WILLOW,You can't stop this.
XANDER,"Yeah, I get that. It's just, where else am I gonna go? You've been my best friend my whole life. World gonna end ... where else would I want to be?"
WILLOW,(scornfully) Is this the master plan? You're going to stop me by telling me you love me?
XANDER,"Well, I was going to walk you off a cliff and hand you an anvil, but ... it seemed kinda cartoony."
WILLOW,Still making jokes.
XANDER,"I'm not joking. I know you're in pain. I can't imagine the pain you're in. And I know you're about to do something apocalyptically (glancing back at the statue) evil and stupid, and hey. (spreading out his arms) I still want to hang. You're Willow."
WILLOW,(angry) Don't call me that.
XANDER,"First day of kindergarten. You cried because you broke the yellow crayon, and you were too afraid to tell anyone. You've come pretty far, ending the world, not a terrific notion. But the thing is? Yeah. I love you. I loved crayon-breaky Willow and I love ... scary veiny Willow. So if I'm going out, it's here. If you wanna kill the world? Well, then start with me. I've earned that."
WILLOW,(upset) You think I won't?
XANDER,It doesn't matter. I'll still love you.
WILLOW,(angry) Shut up.
XANDER,I love you.
XANDER,(panting) I ... love y-
WILLOW,Shut up!!
XANDER,"I love you, Willow."
WILLOW,Stop!
XANDER,I love you.
WILLOW,Stop.
XANDER,I love you.
DAWN,What happened?
ANYA,Giles!
ANYA,You're not dead!
GILES,No.
GILES,"However, I am still in some pain."
ANYA,Oh... (lets him go) Well ... why aren't you dead? (frowns) Why aren't I dead?
GILES,"Uh, the threat's gone. Willow's been stopped."
ANYA,Oh. You mean she's-
GILES,"No, she's alive. It, uh ... the magic she took from me, it-it did what I hoped it would do."
ANYA,Oh. (getting it) You dosed her.
GILES,Yes.
ANYA,You knew she'd going to take your powers all along.
GILES,The gift I was given by the coven was the true essence of magic. Willow's magic came from a ... place of rage and power.
ANYA,And vengeance. Don't forget vengeance.
GILES,"Oh. How could I? In any case, the magic she took from me tapped into ... the spark of humanity she had left. Helped her to feel again. Gave Xander the opportunity to ... reach her."
ANYA,Xander?
GILES,Yes. It was he who got to her in time. (smiling) He saved us all.
DAWN,"I ... I think it's over, Buffy. (Buffy sitting down on a coffin) The world's still here."
DAWN,(sarcastic) Sorry to disappoint y-
DAWN,"Wait, is ... is that happy crying?"
BUFFY,"(sniffles) Yes, dummy. (looks at Dawn) You think I wanted the world to end?"
DAWN,I don't know. (uncertainly) Didn't you?
BUFFY,Dawn ... I'm so sorry.
BUFFY,(crying) I'm sorry.
DAWN,"It's okay, Buffy. It's okay."
BUFFY,No. It hasn't been. It hasn't been okay.
BUFFY,"But it's gonna be, though. I see it."
DAWN,See what?
BUFFY,You.
BUFFY,"Things have really sucked lately, but it's all gonna change. And I wanna be there when it does. (starting to cry again) I want to see my friends happy again. And I want to see you grow up. The woman you're gonna become. Because she's gonna be beautiful."
BUFFY,And she's going to be powerful.
BUFFY,I got it so wrong. I don't want to protect you from the world. I want to show it to you.
BUFFY,There's so much that I want to show you.
"They hug again, smiling. Cue slow music","""The Prayer of St. Francis"" by Sarah McLachlan."
DEMON VOICE,You have endured the required trials.
SPIKE,Bloody right I have.
SPIKE,So you'll give me what I want. Make me what I was. So Buffy can get what she deserves.
DEMON,Very well.
DEMON,We will return...
DEMON,...your soul.
