Note,"This episode was unusual in that they showed ""Previously on Buffy..."""
Buffy,"The Initiative created this thing and they can't stop it, but we will."
Voiceover,Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer...
Voiceover,"Power of the slayer and all who wield it, last to ancient"
Willow,Make us mind and heart and spirit join.
Willow,"Spiritus, the spirit."
Xander,"Animus, heart."
Giles,"Sophus, mind."
Buffy,"And Manus, the hand."
Buffy,You could never hope to grasp the source of our power.
BUFFY,Are you sure you'll be all right? Cause I can be there in the morning.
RILEY,(shakes head) It's just a debriefing.
RILEY,"They're not gonna make me disappear, and they're not pinning anything on me. I got Graham and a lot of the guys testifying I'm the reason they're alive. I might actually get out of this with an honorable discharge."
GILES,"(eating something) In return for your silence, no doubt."
RILEY,Oh yeah. Having the inside scoop on the administration's own Bay of Mutated Pigs is definitely an advantage.
WILLOW,(cheery) It's like you're blackmailing the government. (They look at her) In a ... patriotic way.
RILEY,I'll call you when it's over.
XANDER,(offscreen) Dinner is served.
XANDER,And my very own recipe.
WILLOW,"Ooh, you pushed the button on the microwave that says ""popcorn""?"
XANDER,"(shakes head) Actually, I pushed ""defrost,"" but, um, Joyce was there in the clinch."
RILEY,"Well, you guys have fun tonight. (Extends his hand to Joyce) It was very nice meeting you."
JOYCE,(shakes his hand) It was nice meeting you ... finally.
RILEY,Bye.
BUFFY,Bye.
JOYCE,"(to Buffy) Did you notice how pointedly I said ""finally""?"
BUFFY,(innocent face) No.
XANDER,Let the vid-fest begin.
GILES,(to Joyce) You sure you won't join us?
JOYCE,"No, you guys have your fun. (Buffy and Willow sit on the sofa, Xander on the floor) I'm tired. I can't believe you're not exhausted. Have you even slept since..."
GILES,Still feel a little bit too wired.
WILLOW,"Mm. Yeah, that spell, that was, that was powerful."
BUFFY,Don't think I *could* sleep.
XANDER,"Well, we got plenty of vids. And I'm putting in a preemptive bid for ""Apocalypse Now,"" huh? (Holds up the video)"
WILLOW,(scowls) Did you get anything less heart-of-darkness-y?
XANDER,Apocalypse Now is a gay romp! It's the feel-good movie of whatever year it was.
BUFFY,(not buying it) What else?
XANDER,Don't worry. Got plenty of chick-and-British-guy flicks too. These puppies should last us all night.
TARA,"I think it's strange. I mean, I think I should worry that we haven't found her name."
WILLOW,"Who, Miss Kitty?"
TARA,You'd think she'd let us know her name by now.
WILLOW,She will. (Looking down at Tara) She's not all grown yet.
TARA,You're not worried?
WILLOW,I never worry here. (Smile) I'm safe here.
TARA,You don't know everything about me.
WILLOW,Have you told me your real name?
TARA,"Oh, you know that."
TARA,"They will find out, you know."
TARA,About you.
WILLOW,Don't have time to think about that. (Frown) You know I have all this homework to finish.
TARA,Are you gonna finish in time for class?
WILLOW,I can be late.
TARA,But you've never taken drama before.
TARA,Might miss something important.
WILLOW,I don't wanna leave here.
TARA,Why not?
WILLOW,It's so bright.
WILLOW,"(looking back at Tara, still holding the curtain open) And there's something out there."
XANDER,Hey.
WILLOW,"(casual) Hey, guys. (Keeps walking)"
OZ,Heard you're taking drama. (The guys walk after her)
WILLOW,Uh-huh.
OZ,It's a tough course.
WILLOW,"You took it? (Walks up to a locker, starts trying to open it)"
OZ,"Oh, I've been here forever."
XANDER,So whatcha been doin'? Doing spells? (To Oz) She does spells with Tara.
OZ,"Yeah, I heard about that."
WILLOW,(anxious) I'm gonna be late. (Walks off)
XANDER,Sometimes I think about two women doing a spell ... and then I do a spell by myself.
HARMONY,Isn't this exciting? Our first production! I can't wait till our scene! I love you! Oh! (Hugs Willow. Suddenly drops the fake friendly act.) Don't step on my cues.
WILLOW,Production?
BUFFY,"Ohmigod. The place is packed. Everybody's here! Your whole family's in the front row, (cheerful) and they look really angry."
WILLOW,There's a production?
HARMONY,"(rubbing Willow's shoulders) Oh, somebody's got stage fright."
WILLOW,Isn't this the first class?
RILEY,"Well, you showed up late, or you'd have a better part. (Smiling) I'm Cowboy Guy."
BUFFY,"(to Willow) Your costume is perfect. (Whispers) Nobody's gonna know the truth. You know, about you."
WILLOW,(bemused) Costume?
BUFFY,"(pouting) You're already in character! Oh, I shoulda done that!"
WILLOW,"But how come there's - I mean, I was given to understand that a drama class would have, you know ... drama class. I mean, we haven't even rehearsed!"
HARMONY,"(snorts) Well, maybe some people haven't. (Smiles up at Riley)"
RILEY,"I showed up on time, so I got to be Cowboy Guy. (Harmony nods)"
WILLOW,"(to Buffy) I just think it's really early to be putting on a play. I, I don't even know what... (Eyes widen) This isn't Madame Butterfly, is it, because I have a whole problem with opera."
GILES,"(offscreen) All right, everyone! (Buffy looks excited. Sound of Giles clapping hands for attention) Pay attention! (Everyone gathers around Giles) In just a few moments that curtain is going to open on our very first production. Now, everyone that Willow's ever met ... is out in that audience, including all of us. That means we have to be perfect. (Shot of Willow looking upset) Stay in character, (Willow sees something hairy behind a prop. She stares) remember your lines, and energy energy energy, especially in the musical numbers!"
WILLOW,(whispering) Did anyone see that?
GILES,"Acting is not about behaving, it's about hiding. The audience wants to find you, (We see Harmony behind him, wearing vampire face, grabbing his shoulders and trying to bite him) strip you naked, and eat you alive, so hide. (to Harmony) Stop that. (She stops)"
GILES,"Now, costumes, sets, um, the things that you, uh, you know, uh, you, um... (Shot from above. We see the cast gathered, Harmony still jumping up behind Giles trying to bite him) you hold them, you touch them, uh, use them, um..."
HARMONY,Props?
GILES,No.
RILEY,Props?
GILES,"Yes! (Points at Riley) It's all about subterfuge. (To Harmony) That's very annoying. (To everyone) Now go on out there, lie like dogs, and have a wonderful time. (Shot of Riley looking excited) Now, if we can stay in focus, keep our heads, and if Willow can stop stepping on everyone's cues, (shot of Willow looking anxious) I know this'll be the best production of ""Death of a Salesman"" we've ever done. (To Harmony) Stop it. (Loudly) Good luck everyone! Break a leg! (Pushes through them and leaves)"
MAN,(whispers) I've made a little space for the cheese slices.
TARA,Things aren't going very well.
WILLOW,"(agitated) No! This drama class is just ... I think they're really not doing things in the proper way, and now I'm in a play and my whole family's out there, and ... why is there a cowboy in ""Death of a Salesman"" anyway?"
TARA,"(frowns) You don't understand yet, do you?"
WILLOW,(whispers) Is there something following me?
TARA,Yes.
WILLOW,"Well, what, uh, what should I do? The, the play's gonna start soon, and I don't even know my lines."
TARA,The play's already started. That's not the point.
RILEY,"(swaggers forward, pushes up cowboy hat) Why, hello, little lady. Can I hold those milk pails for you? (Laughter from audience)"
HARMONY,"Why thank you, but they're not very heavy. (Overacting) Why have you come to our lonely small town, which has no post office and very few exports?"
RILEY,I've come looking for a man. (Looks directly into camera) A *sales*man.
TARA,"(offscreen) Everyone's starting to wonder about you. The real you. If they find out, they'll punish you, I ... I can't help you with that."
WILLOW,"Well, what should I ... what's after me? Is it something I-I was supposed to do? W-was I supposed to-"
TARA,Shh. (Looking around)
WILLOW,(whispers) What was that?
BUFFY,"(with contempt) But what else could I expect from a bunch of low-rent, no-account hoodlums like you? Hoodlums, yes, I mean you and your friends, your whole sex, throw 'em in the sea for all I care, throw 'em in and wait for the bubbles, men with your groping and spitting all groin no brain three billion of you passing around the same worn-out urge. Men! With your ... sales!"
WILLOW,"(looking scared, whispers) Tara? Tara, okay, this really isn't fu-"
BUFFY,Will!
WILLOW,Buffy! Oh god.
BUFFY,Come on.
BUFFY,Stay low. (They crouch down and creep between the desks) What did it look like?
WILLOW,I don't know. I-I don't know what's after me.
BUFFY,"Well, you must have *done* something. (Frowning in disapproval)"
WILLOW,"No. I never do anything. I'm very seldom naughty. I, I just came to class, and, and the play was starting."
BUFFY,(straightens up) Play is long over. (Stares at Willow) Why are you still in costume?
WILLOW,"Okay, still having to explain wherein this is just my outfit."
BUFFY,"Willow, everybody already knows. Take it off."
WILLOW,No. No. (Looks around nervously) I need it.
BUFFY,"Oh, for god's sake, just take it off."
BUFFY,That's better. It's much more realistic.
HARMONY,See? Isn't everybody very clear on this now?
ANYA,"My god, it's like a tragedy."
OZ,(to Tara) I tried to warn you.
ANYA,(still giggling) It's exactly like a Greek tragedy. There should only be Greeks.
WILLOW,"(licks lips) My book report. This summer I, I read ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."""
XANDER,"(loudly, to ceiling) Oh, who cares?"
WILLOW,This book ha-has many themes...
WILLOW,Help! Help me!
WILLOW,Help me!
XANDER,I'm awake. I'm good. Did I miss anything?
GILES,(eating popcorn) Not very much at all really.
BUFFY,(eating popcorn) Bunch of massacring.
SOLDIER,"We gotta keep going, men. (Panting) We gotta take that hill. (Xander looks interested) Damn this war!"
GILES,"I have to say, I really feel that ""Apocalypse Now"" is overrated."
XANDER,"No, no. (Points at screen) It gets better."
SOLDIER,Men...
XANDER,I remember that it gets better.
SOLDIER,Oh my god. What's happened to my men? Ahhh!
BUFFY,Want some corn? (Holds out bowl to Xander)
XANDER,(turns head) Butter flavor?
BUFFY,New car smell.
XANDER,Cool. (Leans across Willow to take a handful) What's her deal?
BUFFY,Big faker.
GILES,"(still looking at TV) Oh, I'm beginning to understand this now. It's all about the journey, isn't it?"
XANDER,"Well, thanks for making me have to pee. (Gets up)"
BUFFY,"You don't need any help with that, right?"
XANDER,(heading for stairs) Got a system.
JOYCE,Hey.
XANDER,"Hey Joyce. Mrs. Summers. (Takes a step closer) We're not making too much noise down there, are we?"
JOYCE,"Oh, no. Anyway, they all left a while ago."
XANDER,"Oh, I should probably go catch up."
JOYCE,(grins) I've heard that before.
XANDER,"I move pretty fast. You know, a man's always after-"
JOYCE,Conquest?
XANDER,(shrugs) I'm a conquistador.
JOYCE,"(we see her face and hear her voice, but her lips aren't moving) You sure it isn't comfort?"
XANDER,I'm a comfortador also.
JOYCE,(leans seductively against the door frame) I do know the difference. I've learned about boys.
XANDER,That's cool about you.
JOYCE,(offscreen) It's very late.
JOYCE,Would you like to rest for a while?
XANDER,"Um, yeah. (Confidently) I'd like you. I'm just ... gonna go to the bathroom first."
JOYCE,Don't get lost. (Slinks into her room.)
him,scientists in white coats in the
XANDER,"Okay, I'm gonna find another bathroom."
XANDER,(loudly) I didn't *order* any vampires.
XANDER,(nervous) That's not the way out. (Backing away)
XANDER,"Hey, there you are."
BUFFY,(putting sand in pail with plastic shovel) Are you sure it's us you were looking for?
SPIKE,Giles here is gonna teach me to be a Watcher. Says I got the stuff.
GILES,Spike's like a son to me. (They both smile and continue swinging)
XANDER,"That's good. I was into that for a while, but... (nods toward the street) I got other stuff goin' on."
XANDER,(in playground) You gotta have something. (Looks at Buffy) Gotta be with movin' forward.
BUFFY,(like a proud little kid) Like a shark.
XANDER,Like a shark with feet and ... much less fins.
SPIKE,(like a proud little kid) And on land!
GILES,Very good!
XANDER,"Buffy, are you sure you wanna play there?"
XANDER,It's a pretty big sandbox.
BUFFY,"I'm okay. (Suddenly we see her against the backdrop of the desert from Willow's dream. Rocks, sand, scraggly trees) It's not coming for me yet."
XANDER,I just mean ... you can't protect yourself from ... some stuff.
BUFFY,"I'm way ahead of you, big brother."
XANDER,Brother?
music,a woman vocalizing without
GILES,"Go on, put your back into it! A Watcher scoffs at gravity."
motion,tree-lined streets going by. Anya is sitting in
ANYA,Do you know where you're going?
ANYA,I've been thinking about getting back into vengeance.
XANDER,Is that right?
ANYA,"Well, you know how I miss it. I'm so at loose ends since I quit. I think this is going to be a very big year for vengeance."
XANDER,But ... isn't vengeance kind of ... vengeful?
ANYA,(petulant) You don't want me to have a hobby.
XANDER,"Not a vengeance hobby, no! It's dangerous. People can't do anything they want. Society has rules, and borders, and an end zone. It doesn't matter if-"
XANDER,Do you mind? I'm talking to my demon.
WILLOW,Sorry.
TARA,We just think you're really interesting.
XANDER,"Oh, I-I'm going places."
WILLOW,I'm way ahead of you. (Caressing Tara's leg.)
XANDER,(riveted) Is that right?
WILLOW,Watch this.
TARA,Do you wanna come in the back with us?
ANYA,"Oh, go on."
XANDER,I don't have to.
ANYA,I'll be fine. I think I've figured out how to steer by gesturing emphatically.
XANDER,Girls?
XANDER,(yells) I know what's up there!
MAN,These ... will not protect you.
XANDER,Giles.
GILES,"Xander, what are you doing here?"
XANDER,What's after me?
GILES,"It's because of what we did, I know that. (Takes a bite of the apple)"
XANDER,(shakes his head in confusion) What we did?
GILES,"Hm. Now, the others have gone on ahead. (Points down the hall.) Now, listen very carefully. Your life may depend on what I'm about to tell you. You need-"
GILES,(French)
XANDER,What? Go where? I don't understand.
GILES,(??) Ce n'est pas le temps pour des jeux. [This is not the time for games.]
ANYA,Xander. (Fake French woman's voice) Il faut que tu viens avec nous maintenant. On t'attends. [You have to come with us now. They're waiting for you.]
GILES,C'est que j'ai vous dire. [That's what I said.]
XANDER,"Honey, I don't... I can't hear you."
ANYA,C'est pas importante. Je t'escorte. [It's not important. I'll take you.]
GILES,Allons-y la. [Let's go.]
XANDER,"W-wait! Where we going? Where? (Looks over his shoulder as they pull/push him down the hall. Struggles.) Hey! (People in the crowd pick him up. In the crowd we can still see Giles with the apple in his mouth.) Let go! Hey! (The final ""Hey"" echoes.)"
VOICE,"Where are you from, Harris?"
XANDER,"Well, the basement, mostly."
VOICE,Were you born there?
XANDER,Possibly.
VOICE,I walked by your guidance counselor's office one time.
SNYDER,A bunch of you were sitting there ... waiting to be shepherded.
SNYDER,I remember it smelled like dead flowers. Like decay. Then it hit me. The hope of our nation's future is a bunch of mulch.
XANDER,"You know, I never got the chance to tell you how glad I was you were eaten by a snake."
SNYDER,Where are you heading?
XANDER,"(shrugs uncertainly) Well, I'm supposed to meet Tara and Willow."
XANDER,And possibly Buffy's mom.
SNYDER,Your time is running out.
XANDER,"No, I'm just trying to get away. There's ... something I can't fight."
SNYDER,Are you a soldier?
XANDER,(shakes head) I'm a comfortador.
SNYDER,(contemptuous) You're neither. You're a whipping boy. Raised by mongrels and set on a sacrificial stone.
XANDER,(nods) I'm getting a cramp.
XANDER,"Giles, it's here!"
GILES,It's more serious than we thought.
XANDER,Giles!
BUFFY,I can fight anything. Right?
ANYA,Maybe we should slap her.
XANDER,Buffy?
XANDER,(whispers) That's not the way out.
VOICE,What the hell is wrong with you?
DAD,You won't come upstairs? What are you ... ashamed of us? Your mother's crying her guts out!
XANDER,You don't understand.
DAD,"No. You don't understand. (Starts down the stairs, stomping angrily) The line ends here with us, and you're not gonna change that."
DAD,You haven't got the heart.
VOICEOVER,You have to stop thinking.
VOICEOVER,Let it wash over you.
BUFFY,Don't you think it's a little old-fashioned?
GILES,This is the way women and men have behaved since the beginning...
GILES,...before time. Now look into the light.
BUFFY,Come on! Come on!
BUFFY,We're gonna miss all the good stuff.
OLIVIA,Does she always want to train this badly?
GILES,"Well, it appears she's never heard the fable about patience."
OLIVIA,Which one is that?
GILES,"The, the one about the fox, and the, uh, less patient fox."
BUFFY,"(stops in front of a game booth) Here, I want to, I want to!"
GILES,"Yes, go ahead."
BUFFY,(turns to the booth. There's a big coffin with a fake-looking vampire standing behind it.)
VAMP,(bouncing) I am a vampire!
GILES,"(exasperated) Buffy, you have a sacred birthright to protect mankind. (Buffy turns to look at him, pouting) Don't stick out your elbow."
VAMP,(bouncing) I am a vampire!
VAMP,"Ahh, you staked me!"
GILES,I haven't got any treats.
OLIVIA,"For god's sake, Rupert, go easy on the girl. (Smiling)"
GILES,"(to Olivia) This is my business. Blood of the lamb and all that. (Looks at Buffy) Oh, now you're gonna get that all over your face."
GILES,I know you. (echoing)
SPIKE,(offscreen) Hey!
SPIKE,Come on! (Gesturing) You're gonna miss everything!
GILES,Don't push me around. You know I have a great deal to do.
SPIKE,I've hired myself out as an attraction.
shot,"Giles staring at Spike, Olivia still crying in the background.)"
GILES,Sideshow freak?
shot,Spike flips up the collar of his coat.)
SPIKE,"Well, at least it's showbiz."
Color,"Giles moves forward, looks in confusion at Olivia, back in Spike's"
GILES,(very confused) What am I supposed to do with all of this?
SPIKE,"(offscreen) You gotta make up your mind, Rupes."
SPIKE,"What are you wasting your time for? (Pose, flashbulbs)"
Color,Giles turning to look at Spike again.)
SPIKE,"Haven't you figured it all out yet, with your enormous squishy frontal lobes? (Another pose, more oohs, flashbulbs)"
Color,Giles walking across the crypt.)
GILES,I still think Buffy should have killed you.
W,Spike looks annoyed. He strikes a Jesus-on-the-cross pose. Very loud
Color,Giles walking through crypt. The bald man stops him.)
MAN,I wear the cheese. It does not wear me.
GILES,"Honestly, you meet the most appalling sorts of people."
GILES,I'm so sorry I'm late. There's a great deal going on. And all at once!
WILLOW,"Don't we know it. Only at death's door over here, look at Xander!"
XANDER,"Got the sucking chest wound swingin'. (Points at it, then at the stage) I promised Anya I'd be there for her big night. (Giles looks at the stage) Now I'll probably be pushing up daisies, in the sense of being in the ground underneath them and fertilizing the soil with decomposition."
ANYA,"Okay. A man ... walks into the office of a doctor. (Willow and Xander go back to their books) He's wearing on his head, um..."
ANYA,"Wait, there's, there's a, there's a duck. Is that right?"
CROWD,You suck!
ANYA,Quiet! You'll miss the humorous conclusion.
GILES,She's doing quite well.
WILLOW,Do you know this is your fault?
GILES,"We have to think of the facts, Willow. I'm very busy. I have a gig myself, you know."
WILLOW,"(sighs) Something's after us. It's, uh, like some primal ... some animal force."
GILES,That used to be us.
XANDER,"Don't get linear on me now, man."
ANYA,"And ... then the duck tells the doctor that there's a man, that's attached to my ass."
ANYA,"See, it was the duck, and not the man that spoke."
WILLOW,"Rupert. (Giles turns to look at her) You've gotta focus. You must have some kind of explanation. If we don't know what we're fighting, I don't think we stand a chance."
GILES,"(sings) It's strange, it's not like anything we've faced before."
GILES,(sings) It seems familiar somehow. Of course!
GILES,"(sings) The spell we cast with Buffy. Must have released. Some primal evil that's come back seeking (removes glasses). I'm not sure what. Willow, look through the chronicles (Willow nods, reaches for another book). For some reference. To a warrior beast"
GILES,"(sings) I've got to warn Buffy. There's every chance she might be next. Xander, help Willow"
GILES,(sings) And try not to bleed on my couch I've just had it steam-cleaned.
GILES,"(sings) No, wait..."
GILES,"Well, that was ... obvious."
GILES,I know who you are.
GILES,"And I can defeat you ... with my intellect. (We see the creature approaching from behind) I ... can cripple you with my thoughts. (It grabs his hair, puts a weapon against his forehead) Of course, you underestimate me. You couldn't know."
GILES,You never had a Watcher.
ANYA,(whispers offscreen) Buffy! Wake up!
ANYA,"(whispers) Buffy, you have to wake up right away!"
BUFFY,I'm not really in charge of these things. (Closes eyes)
ANYA,(anxious) Please wake up. Oh please.
BUFFY,"(opens eyes) I need my beauty sleep. So stop it, okay?"
BUFFY,Faith and I just made that bed.
TARA,(offscreen) For who?
BUFFY,I thought you were here to tell me.
BUFFY,"(looking back at bed) The guys aren't here, are they? We were gonna hang out (looks at Tara) and, watch movies t-"
TARA,You lost them.
BUFFY,No. (Looks confused) No. I think they need me to find them.
7,30 AM.)
BUFFY,(upset) It's so late.
TARA,Oh ... that clock's completely wrong. Here.
BUFFY,I'm never gonna use those.
TARA,You think you know ... what's to come ... what you are. You haven't even begun.
BUFFY,I think I need to go find the others.
TARA,(softly) Be back before dawn.
BUFFY,Have you seen my friends? (He shakes his head and walks on) They wouldn't just disappear.
BUFFY,Mom?
JOYCE,"Oh, hi, honey."
BUFFY,Why are you living in the walls?
JOYCE,"Oh, sweetie, no, I'm fine here. Don't worry about me."
BUFFY,It looks dirty.
JOYCE,"Well, it seems that way to you. (Smiling) I made some lemonade, and I'm learning how to play mah-jongg. You go find your friends."
BUFFY,"I, I think they might be in danger."
JOYCE,"I-I'm sorry, dear. (Giggling) Um, a mouse is playing with my knees."
BUFFY,"I, I really don't think you should live in there."
JOYCE,Well ... you could ... probably break through the wall.
RILEY,"Hey there, killer."
BUFFY,(offscreen) Riley? You're back.
RILEY,I never left.
BUFFY,(offscreen) But how did the debriefing go?
RILEY,I told you not to worry about that. It went great. They made me surgeon general.
BUFFY,Why didn't you come and tell me? We could have celebrated.
RILEY,"Oh. (Looks at the other man ) We're drawing up a plan for world domination. (Looks back at Buffy, pleased.) The key element? Coffeemakers that think."
BUFFY,World domination? I-is that a good?
RILEY,"Baby, we're the government."
RILEY,It's what we do.
GUY,"She's uncomfortable with certain concepts. (He's wearing a suit too, with no jacket.) It's understandable. Aggression is a natural human tendency. (Looks at Buffy) Though you and me come by it another way."
BUFFY,We're not demons.
GUY,Is that a fact?
RILEY,"Buffy, we've got important work here. (Same camera angle on Riley, the gun prominent in the foreground.) A lot of filing, giving things names."
BUFFY,(looks at other guy) What was yours?
GUY,Before Adam? (Shakes his head. Suddenly the lighting turns blue)
VOICE,The demons have escaped. Please run for your lives.
ADAM,This could be trouble. (He and Riley stand)
RILEY,We better make a fort.
ADAM,(nodding) I'll get some pillows. (Leaves)
BUFFY,(gasping anxiously) Wait! I have weapons!
RILEY,"(offscreen) Thought you were looking for your friends. Okay, killer..."
RILEY,...if that's the way you want it. I guess you're on your own.
before,"rocks, scraggly bushes, sand. Again we hear the woman humming."
BUFFY,I'm never gonna find them here.
VOICEOVER,Of course not. That's the reason you came.
VOICEOVER,You're not in my dream.
VOICEOVER,I was borrowed.
TARA,Someone has to speak for her.
BUFFY,Let her speak for herself. (We see the dark-haired creature walking up behind her.) That's what's done in polite circles.
BUFFY,Why do you follow me?
TARA,(offscreen) I don't.
BUFFY,Where are my friends?
TARA,(offscreen) You're asking the wrong questions.
BUFFY,(firmly) Make her speak.
TARA,"(offscreen) I have no speech. No name. I live in the action of death, the blood cry, the penetrating wound. (The woman straightens up and looks Buffy in the eye.)"
TARA,I am destruction. Absolute ... alone.
BUFFY,The Slayer.
Tara,(offscreen) The first.
BUFFY,I am not alone.
TARA,The Slayer does not walk in this world.
BUFFY,I walk.
BUFFY,"I talk. I shop, I sneeze. I'm gonna be a fireman when the floods roll back."
BUFFY,(offscreen) There's trees in the desert since you moved out. (The First Slayer shakes her head) And I don't sleep on a bed of bones.
BUFFY,(firmly) Now give me back my friends.
SLAYER,No ... friends! Just the kill.
SLAYER,We ... are ... alone!
BUFFY,That's it. I'm waking up.
BUFFY,It's over. (Woman humming begins again. First Slayer shakes her head) We don't do this any more.
VOICEOVER,Enough!
BUFFY,Are you quite finished?
BUFFY,"It's over, okay? I'm going to ignore you, and you're going to go away."
BUFFY,You're really gonna have to get over the whole ... primal power thing. (walks toward the sofa)
BUFFY,(over her shoulder) You're *not* the source of me.
BUFFY,"Also, in terms of hair care, you really wanna say, what kind of impression am I making in the workplace? 'Cause-"
WILLOW,The First Slayer. Wow.
XANDER,Not big with the socialization.
WILLOW,Or the floss.
GILES,"Somehow our joining with ... Buffy and ... invoking the essence of the, the Slayer's power was an affront to the source of that power."
BUFFY,"You know, you could have brought that up to us *before* we did it."
GILES,I did. I said there could be dire consequences.
BUFFY,"Yes, but you say that about chewing too fast."
JOYCE,"I'm, uh, guessing I missed some fun?"
WILLOW,The spirit of the first Slayer tried to kill us in our dreams.
JOYCE,"Oh, you want some hot chocolate?"
JOYCE,Xander?
XANDER,"Yes, what, Joyce? (Nervously) Uh ... Buffy's mom."
JOYCE,"Be my kitchen buddy again, help me carry? (Nods toward the kitchen)"
XANDER,Yes. Sure. (Nervously) Buffy's mom.
Giles,You all right?
BUFFY,Yeah. I think I might jump in the shower.
GILES,"You seem a bit, uh..."
BUFFY,"A little. (Pensive) The First Slayer. I never really thought about it. (Sighs) It was intense. I-I guess you guys got a taste of that, huh."
XANDER,"Yeah, from now on, you keep your Slayer friends out of my dreams. Is that clear?"
WILLOW,It's not good for the sleepin'.
BUFFY,"Ah... (Gets up) Well, at least you all didn't dream about that guy with the cheese. (Walks off.)"
BUFFY,(offscreen) I don't know *where* the hell that came from.
VOICEOVER,You think you know ... what's to come ... what you are. You haven't even begun.
