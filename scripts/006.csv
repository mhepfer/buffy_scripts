Kyle,"Oh, look. It's Buffy and all her friends."
Buffy,That's a witty.
Tor,Do you ever wonder why nobody cool wants to hang out with you?
Buffy,Just thankful.
Rhonda,Were you this popular at your old school? Before you got kicked  out?
Tor,(at Buffy as they leave) Careful! She might beat you up!
Xander,Hey! Buffy!
Willow,You missed it!
Buffy,Missed what?
Xander,"We just saw the zebras mating! (nods to Willow) Thank you, very  exciting..."
Willow,"It was like the Heimlich, with stripes!"
Buffy,(with mock disappointment) And I missed it. Yet somehow I'll  find the courage to live on. (begins walking)
Willow,(follows) Where were you?
Buffy,"Uh, I was looking at the fishes."
Willow,Was it cool?
Buffy,It was fishes.
Xander,I'm feelin' that you're not in the field trip spirit here.
Buffy,"Well, it would... It's nothing, I... We do the same zoo trip at  my old school every year. Same old, same old."
Xander,"Buffy, this isn't just about looking at a bunch of animals.  This is about not being in class!"
Buffy,"(brightens) You know, you're right! Suddenly the animals look  shiny and new."
Xander,Gotta have perspective.
Kyle,Lance! How's it goin'?
Lance,"Hey, Kyle."
Kyle,"So, is this like a, uh, family reunion?"
Lance,No.
Kyle,I think it's a family reunion. It's so... touching. Doesn't  anybody have a camera? (makes a sudden photo-taking gesture) Whapish!
Rhonda,"(behind Lance) Hey, does your mom still pick out your lice, or  are you old enough to do that yourself now?"
Lance,"Quit it, huh? (Tor takes his notebook) Hey! Guys, c'mon! It's  got my notes in there!"
Kyle,Nothing.
Lance,They weren't doing anything. Really! (lets out a nervous laugh)  We were just playin' around.
Kyle,(points at Lance) You! Came through big time.
Rhonda,"Way to go, Lance! (pats his shoulder)"
Tor,Flutie's been looking for a reason to come down on us.
Lance,It's okay.
Kyle,"Come on, we're gonna check out the Hyena House."
Lance,But I think it's off-limits.
Kyle,"And therein, my friend, lies the fun."
Willow,What are Kyle and his buds doing with Lance?
Xander,"Oh, playing with him as a cat plays with a mouse."
Buffy,What is it with those guys?
Willow,They're obnoxious. Professionally.
Xander,"Well, every school has 'em. So, you start a new school, you get  your desks, some blackboards and some mean kids."
Buffy,"Yeah, well, I'd better extract Lance before..."
Xander,(interrupts) I'll handle it. This job doesn't require actual  slaying. (goes in)
Buffy,You don't think we should follow?
Willow,"Kyle and those guys are jerks, but they're all talk. Mostly."
Buffy,(reconsiders) Why don't we...
Willow,"Yeah, why don't we?"
Zookeeper,"Oh, hold it, hold it, are you blind, or are you just  illiterate? Because hyenas are very quick to prey on the weak."
Buffy,"Oh, w-we were just gonna take..."
Zookeeper,You're not going in there. Anyone that does is in a world of  trouble.
Willow,"No, no one's going in there. (she and Buffy come back out)"
Buffy,Why is it off-limits?
Zookeeper,"It's a quarantine. These hyenas just came in from Africa, so  keep out. (cocks his eyebrow) Even if they call your name."
Buffy,What are you talking about?
Zookeeper,"The Masai tribesmen told me that hyenas are capable of  understanding human speech. They follow humans around by day, learning  their names. At night, when the campfire dies, they call out to a  person. Once they separate him, the pack (snaps his fingers) devours  them."
Kyle,Cool!
Lance,I don't see any hyenas.
Lance,Okay! Now we've seen it.
Rhonda,Looks cute.
Kyle,I think it looks hungry. (moves toward Lance)
Lance,No!
Tor,"C'mon, Spot!"
Lance,"C'mon, stop it!"
Tor,Supper time!
Lance,Guys! Stop! It's not funny!
Lance,Ow! Stop it! It's not funny!
Xander,(to Kyle) Why don't you pick on somebody your own species?
Kyle,"What, are *you* gonna get in my face?"
Willow,I thought Xander would be here by now.
Buffy,"Hmm, that'd make him on time. We couldn't have that!"
Willow,Did he seem upset at all on the bus back from the zoo?
Buffy,About what?
Willow,I dunno. He was quiet.
Buffy,"I didn't notice anything. (they sit) But then again I'm not as  hyperaware of him as, oh, say, for example, you."
Willow,Hyperaware?
Buffy,"Well, I'm not constantly monitoring his health, his moods, his  blood pressure..."
Willow,(grins) 130 over 80!
Buffy,"(amused) You got it bad, girl!"
Willow,He makes my head go tingly. You know what I mean?
Buffy,I dimly recall.
Willow,But it hasn't happened to you lately?
Buffy,Not of late.
Willow,Not even for a dangerous and mysterious older man whose leather  jacket you're wearing right now?
Buffy,(in mock annoyance) Goes with the shoes!
Willow,"Come on, Angel pushes your buttons. You know he does."
Buffy,"I suppose some girls might find him good looking... (gets a look  from Willow) ...if they have eyes, alright, he's a honey, but... it's  just he's never around, and when he is, all he wants to do is talk about  vampires, and... I, I just can't have a relationship..."
Willow,(sees Xander) There he is!
Buffy,Angel?
Willow,Xander!
Xander,Girls!
Buffy,Boy!
Xander,"Sorry I'm late, I... just forgot that we were gonna be here.  (sees Buffy's croissant) Hungry! (tears a piece off and eats it)"
Willow,"Xander, you still want me to help you with geometry tomorrow?  (Xander takes a swig of Buffy's cola) We can work after class..."
Xander,(gives Willow a thumbs-up) Yeah. (to Buffy) What is this crap?
Buffy,"Well, it *was* my buttery croissant."
Xander,"Man, I need some food! Birds live on this!"
Xander,What?
Buffy,What's up with you?
Willow,Is something wrong? Did I do something?
Xander,(to Willow) What could you possibly do? That's crazy talk. I'm  just... restless.
Willow,"Well, we could go to the ice cream place..."
Xander,(points to the table) I like it here.
Buffy,"Okay, now what?"
Xander,You took a bath.
Buffy,"Yeah, I-I often do, I'm actually known for it."
Xander,That's okay.
Buffy,And the weird behavior award goes to...
Lyrics,"<I>Oh, Reluctant Man</I>"
Buffy,"Oh, great. It's the winged monkeys."
Lyrics,<I>Who's afraid to touch the world / Why are you hiding? / What is  the base of all your fears?</I>
Lyrics,<I>Do you find yourself in a cold cruel world</I>
Lyrics,"<I>Dark and desperate, scared and lonely?</I>"
Lyrics,<I>Selfish Man / Who never gave to no one else / What are you  holding? / Is it worth the price you pay?</I>
Kyle,"(to the boy at the table) Y'know, I don't understand why you're  sitting at our table."
Lyrics,<I>'Cause your eyes they see just what you want to see</I>
Rhonda,"Yeah, shouldn't you be hovering over the football stadium with  'Goodyear' written on you?"
Lyrics,<I>And I hope they're not staring blindly at me</I>
Xander,Kid's fat.
Giles,Right! (Buffy stops short) That's enough training for one day.
Buffy,"Well, that last roundhouse was kinda sloppy. Are you sure you  don't wanna do it again?"
Giles,"(out of breath) No! No, no, that's fine. You just... run along  to class. (Buffy goes) (to himself) While I wait for the feeling to  return to my arms."
Buffy,He's so cute!
Buffy,"He doesn't look mean, Mr. Flutie."
Buffy,You're right. He's a fine mascot and will engender school  spirit.
Xander,I'm not getting this.
Willow,"It's simple, really. See, 'The bisector of a vertex is the line  that divides the angle at that vertex into two equal parts.'"
Xander,"It's like a big blur, all these numbers and angles."
Willow,It's the same stuff from last week. You had it down then.
Xander,Why do I need to learn this?
Willow,'Cause otherwise you'll flunk math?
Xander,Explain the part where that's bad. (rubs the bridge of his  nose)
Willow,"You remember, you fail math, you flunk out of school, you end  up being the guy at the pizza place that sweeps the floor and says,  'Hey, kids, where's the cool parties this weekend?' We've been through  this. (Xander rubs his right temple) Do you have a headache? (reaches up  to him)"
Xander,"(shakes her off) Yeah, and I think I know what's causing it.  (throws his geometry book into the trash) Ah! That's better, it goes  right to the source of the pain."
Willow,Xander...
Xander,"(frustrated) Look, forget it, okay? I don't get it. I won't  ever. (gets up) I don't care."
Willow,(watches Xander go) We can finish this another time.
Buffy,(to Herbert) Yeah!
Willow,Xander... What's wrong with you?
Xander,I guess you've noticed that I've been different around you  lately.
Willow,Yes.
Xander,"I think, um... I think it's because my feelings for you have  been changing."
Xander,"And, well, we've been friends for such a long time that I feel  like I need to tell you something."
Xander,"I've, um... I've decided to drop geometry. So I won't be  needing your math help anymore. Which means I won't have to look at your  pasty face again."
Buffy,You gonna say something to me?
Xander,Dogs!
Kyle,Where?
Rhonda,Shut up.
Kyle,You're sharing.
Xander,Friends like to share. (to Tor and Heidi) Good?
Tor,It's too well-done.
Xander,Let's do lunch.
Lyrics,<I>I'm sure this rain won't last / I'm sure its time is up /  Though it's pouring down</I>
Lyrics,"<I>I'm sure this rain won't last / And it falls on Job's eyes /  This water of doubt / And I'm wading in lies / It's wearing me out / But  if you want it, alright / I'll buy it / I'll buy it / I'll buy it / I'll  buy it / I'll buy it / I'll...</I>"
Willow,"I've known him my whole life, Buffy."
Willow,"(tears in her eyes) Well, we haven't always been close, but  he's never... (exhales)"
Buffy,I think something's wrong with him.
Willow,Or maybe there's something wrong with me.
Buffy,What are you talking about?
Willow,"C'mon. He's not picking on you. He's just sniffing you a lot. I  don't know, maybe three isn't company anymore."
Buffy,You think this has something to do with me?
Willow,Of course.
Buffy,No. That still doesn't explain why he's hanging out with the  dode patrol. (hops off the railing) Something's going on. Something  weird. (starts to go)
Willow,What're you gonna do?
Buffy,Talk to the expert on weird.
Giles,Xander's taken to teasing the less fortunate?
Buffy,Uh-huh.
Giles,"And, there's been a noticeable change in both clothing and  demeanor?"
Buffy,Yes.
Giles,"And, well, otherwise all his spare time is spent lounging about  with imbeciles."
Buffy,"It's bad, isn't it."
Giles,"It's devastating. He's turned into a sixteen-year-old boy.  Course, you'll have to kill him."
Buffy,"Giles, I'm serious."
Giles,"So am I. Except for the part about killing him. Testosterone is  a great equalizer. It turns all men into morons. He will, however, get  over it."
Buffy,"(exasperated) I cannot believe that you, of all people, are  trying to Scully me. There is something supernatural at work here.  (grabs some books) Get your books! Look stuff up!"
Giles,(takes the books) Look under what?
Buffy,I don't know. (exhales) That's your department.
Giles,The evidence that you've presented me with is sketchy at best.
Buffy,"He scared the pig. (Giles gives her a look) Well, he did..."
Giles,"Buffy, boys can be cruel. They tease, they, they, they prey on  the weak. I-i-it's natural teen behavior pattern."
Buffy,What did you just say?
Giles,"Um, they tease."
Buffy,"They prey on the weak. I've heard that somewhere bef... (it  clicks in her mind) Xander has been acting totally wiggy ever since we  went to the zoo. Him and Kyle and all those guys, they went into the  hyena cage. Oh, God, that laugh..."
Giles,"You're saying that, uh, Xander's becoming a hyena."
Buffy,"I don't know. Or been possessed by one? Not just Xander, all of  them."
Giles,"Well, I-I-I've cer-certainly never heard of, uh..."
Willow,(comes into the library) Herbert! They found him.
Buffy,The pig?
Willow,Dead. And also eaten. Principal Flutie's freaking out.
Buffy,"(to Giles) Testosterone, huh?"
Willow,What're you gonna do?
Giles,Get my books. Look stuff up.
Kyle,What?
Rhonda,How is Herbert?
Heidi,Crunchy!
Buffy,Wow! Apparently Noah rejected the hyenas from the Ark because he  thought they were an evil impure mixture of dogs and cats.
Willow,Hyenas aren't well liked.
Buffy,They do seem to be the schmoes of the animal kingdom. (comes  over to Willow)
Willow,"Why couldn't Xander be possessed by a puppy or, or some ducks?"
Buffy,That's assuming 'possession' is the right word.
Giles,"(comes over from the cage) Oh, I'll say it is. The Masai of the  Serengeti have spoken of animal possession for, for generations. I... I  should have remembered that."
Buffy,So how does it work?
Giles,"Well, apparently there's a, a sect of animal worshipers known as  Primals. They believe that humanity, uh, consciousness, uh, the soul, is  a, is a perversion, a dilution of spirit. Uh, to them the animal state  is holy. They are able, through trans-possession, to, to, um, draw the  spirit of certain animals into themselves."
Buffy,And then they started acting like hyenas.
Giles,"Well, only the most predatory of animals are, are of interest to  the Primals, so, uh, yes, yes, that would fit, yes."
Buffy,"So, what happens to the person once the spirit's in them?"
Giles,If it goes unchecked...
Buffy,I gotta find Xander.
Buffy,(exhales) They are strong.
Buffy,Xander.
Buffy,(exhales) This is ridiculous. We need to talk.
Xander,(smiles) Been waitin' for you to jump my bones.
Buffy,Get off of me.
Xander,"Is that what you really want? (Buffy struggles a bit) We both  know what you really want. You want danger, don't cha? You like your men  dangerous."
Buffy,"You're in trouble, Xander. You are infected with some hyena  thing, it's like a demonic possession!"
Xander,"Dangerous and mean, right? Like Angel. Your Mystery Guy. Well,  guess who just got mean."
Rhonda,I'm sorry...
Xander,Do you know how long... I've waited... until you'd stop  pretending that we aren't attracted...
Xander,Until Willow... stops kidding herself... that I could settle  with anyone but you?
Buffy,"Look, Xander, I don't wanna hurt you..."
Xander,Now do you wanna hurt me?
Xander,"Come on, Slayer. I like it when you're scared."
Xander,"The more I scare you, (sniffs her) the better you smell."
Buffy,Hurry up. We gotta get him locked up somehow before he comes to.
Willow,"Oh, my God, Xander! What happened?"
Buffy,I hit him.
Willow,With what?
Buffy,A desk.
Buffy,He tried his hand at felony sexual assault.
Willow,"Oh, Buffy, the hyena in him didn't..."
Buffy,"No. (they arrange him on the floor of the cage) No, but it's  safe to say that in his animal state his idea of wooing doesn't involve  a Yanni CD and a bottle of Chianti. (locks the cage) There, that oughtta  hold him. Where's Giles?"
Willow,He got called to some teacher's meeting. What are we gonna do?  I mean... how do we get Xander back?
Buffy,Right now I'm a little more worried about what the rest of the  pack are up to.
Giles,The rest of the pack were spotted outside Herbert the mascot's  cage. They were sent to the principal's office.
Willow,Good! That'll show 'em. (Giles is silent) Did it show 'em?
Buffy,"They didn't hurt him, did they?"
Giles,"They, uh... ate him."
Buffy,They ate Principal Flutie?
Willow,Ate him up?
Giles,"The, uh, official theory is that wild dogs got into his office  somehow. There was no one at the scene."
Willow,"But Xander didn't. (to Buffy) He, he was with you."
Giles,"(sees Xander in the cage) Oh! Uh, well, that's a small mercy."
Buffy,"Giles, how do we stop this? How do you trans-possess someone?"
Giles,"I-I'm afraid I still don't have all the pieces. Um, the accounts  of the Primals and their methods are a bit thin on the ground. There is  some talk of a-a-a predatory act, but the exact ritual is, is, um...  (thinks, picks up a book) The Malleus Maleficarum deals in particulars  of demonic possession, which... may apply... (looks through a few pages)  Yes, one, one should be able to transfer the spirits to another human."
Buffy,"Oh, that's great. Any volunteers?"
Giles,Oh. Good point.
Buffy,What we need to do is put the hyena back in the hyena.
Giles,"B-but until we know more, uh..."
Buffy,Betcha that zookeeper could tell us. Maybe he didn't quarantine  those hyenas because they were sick.
Giles,We should talk to him.
Buffy,"Okay. (starts to go but stops) Oh, wait, somebody's gotta watch  Xander."
Willow,(gets up) I will.
Buffy,"Will, are you sure? If he wakes up..."
Willow,(holds her hand out for the keys) I'll be alright. Go.
Buffy,(to Giles) C'mon.
Xander,Willow.
Willow,How are you feeling?
Xander,Like somebody hit me with a desk. (looks around) What am I  doin' here?
Willow,(gets up and goes toward the cage) You're... resting?
Xander,You guys got me locked up now. (stands up)
Willow,'Cause you're sick. Buffy said...
Xander,"(interrupts) Oh, yeah. Buffy and her all-purpose solution:  punch 'em out 'n' knock 'em down. I'd love to see what she'd do to  somebody who was *really* sick."
Willow,That's not fair. Buffy saved both of our lives.
Xander,"Before she came here our lives didn't need that much saving,  did they? Weren't things a lot simpler when it was just you and me?"
Willow,(moves closer) Maybe...
Xander,"When we were alone together... Willow, I know there's something  wrong with me. I think it's gettin' worse. But I can't just stand around  waitin' for Buffy to decide it's time to punch me out again. (exhales)  Look, I want you to help me. I want you."
Willow,I am helping you.
Xander,(exhales) You're doing what you're told.
Willow,"Buffy's trying to help you, too. You know that. Or Xander does."
Xander,"Yeah... Buffy's so selfless. Always thinking of us. Well, if  I'm so dangerous, how come she left you alone with me?"
Willow,I told her to.
Xander,Why?
Willow,'Cause I know you better than she does... and I wanted to be  here to see if... you were still you.
Xander,You know I am. Look at me. (long pause) Looook.
Willow,"(moves even closer, whispers) Xander..."
Willow,Now I know.
Xander,(bangs on the cage) LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!
Zookeeper,The students have been possessed by the hyenas?
Giles,Yes.
Zookeeper,Are you sure?
Buffy,"We're really, really sure."
Giles,Y-you don't seem enormously surprised by this.
Zookeeper,The zoo imported those hyenas from Africa. There was  something strange about them from day one. I did some homework... That  particular breed is very rare. Totally vicious. Historically they were  worshipped by these guys...
Giles,Primals.
Zookeeper,"Yeah! Creepy guys! Now, they had rituals for taking the  hyena spirits, but I-I don't see how that coulda happened to your kids."
Giles,"Uh, we don't know exactly how the ritual works. We know that it  involves a, um, um... predatory act and some kind of symbol."
Zookeeper,Predatory act? Of course. That makes sense. Where did you  read that?
Giles,"Do you have Sherman Jeffries' work on, on cults and on..."
Buffy,(impatiently) Boys?
Giles,Sorry.
Zookeeper,Look.
Giles,(raises his hand slightly) Sorry.
Zookeeper,Look. I think we may have enough information so that  together we could pull off a reverse trans-possession.
Buffy,What do we do?
Zookeeper,We've gotta get those possessed students over to the hyena  cage right away. I'll meet you there. We can begin the rituals.
Buffy,"W-well, we can guarantee one of them, but there are four more,  and we have no idea where they are."
Zookeeper,"No, I wouldn't worry about that. After hyenas feed and rest  they will track the missing member of their pack until they find him.  They should come right to you."
Buffy,(worried) Willow!
Xander,Willow...
Willow,I'm not listening.
Kyle,Wiiillooow...
Kyle,Wiiillooow...
Willow,"(turns to the cage) Xander, shut up!"
Kyle,Wiiillooow...
Giles,Run!
Buffy,I think they're going.
Willow,They could be faking it.
Buffy,"No, they're hungry. They'll be looking for somebody weak. I'm  really sorry, Will. I didn't know they were gonna come after Xander."
Willow,(shaken) It's okay.
Giles,We must lead them back to the zoo if we're going to stop this.
Buffy,And before their next meal. Guess that's my job.
Giles,"Well, individually they're almost as strong as you. As a group  they're..."
Buffy,"They're tough, but I think they're getting stupider. You guys go  to the zoo and I will bring them to you. (leaves)"
Joey,Get away!
Buffy,Didn't your mom teach you? (Xander hears her) Don't play with  your food.
Buffy,C'mon. You know what you want.
Willow,The pathway to the Hyena House. Where's the zookeeper?
Giles,"Uh, he must be inside. I-I'll go in and prepare things. You just  warn, uh, us when you hear Buffy and the others approaching."
Giles,Doctor? Uh... Zookeeper?
Giles,"Oh! Oh, of course, the, uh, Masai ceremonial garb. Yes... Very  good. Are you, uh, otherwise prepared for the trans-possession?"
Zookeeper,(nods) Almost.
Giles,"(notices the markings on the floor) Oh, right! The, uh, sacred  circle. Yes, you'd need that to, um... This would be here when... when  the children first came. Why would you... (figures it out, exhales) How  terribly frustrating for you, that a bunch of school children could  accomplish what you could not."
Zookeeper,It bothered me. But the power will be mine.
Willow,They're almost here! Giles! Giles! (sees the zookeeper) Where  are the hyenas for the trans-possession?
Zookeeper,They're right here in the feeding area.
Zookeeper,Stay back! They haven't been fed.
Willow,Where's Giles?
Zookeeper,He's... laying in wait.
Willow,They're almost here. Shouldn't you bring the hyenas out?
Zookeeper,When the time is right. I'm gonna need your help. (begins  binding her wrists)
Buffy,They're right behind me!
Willow,That's Buffy! Get ready!
Zookeeper,Here.
Willow,What is this?
Zookeeper,"A predatory act, remember? (holds a knife to her throat)"
Willow,"Uh, right. You'll pretend to slash my throat and, and put the  evil in the hyenas?"
Zookeeper,Something like that.
Willow,"Buffy, it's a trap!"
Zookeeper,YU BA YA SA NA!
Xander,Willow!
Giles,"Uh, did I miss anything?"
Willow,I heard the vice-principal's taking over till they can find a  replacement.
Buffy,It shouldn't be too hard to find a new principal. Unless they  ask what happened to the last one.
Xander,"Okay, but I had nothing to do with that, right?"
Buffy,"Oh, right."
Willow,You only ate the pig.
Xander,I ate a pig? Was it cooked and called bacon or...
Xander,"(covering his face) Oh, my God! I ate a pig? I mean, the whole  trichinosis issue aside, yuck!"
Buffy,"Well, it wasn't really you."
Xander,"Well, I remember I was goin' on the field trip, and then goin'  down to the Hyena House, and next thing some guy's holding Willow and  he's got a knife."
Willow,You saved my life.
Xander,Hey! Nobody messes with my Willow. (gives her a hug)
Buffy,This is definitely the superior Xander. Accept no substitutes.
Xander,"I didn't do anything else, did I, around you guys or anything  embarrassing?"
Buffy,(shakes her head) Nah!
Willow,Not at all.
Buffy,(to Willow) C'mon. We're gonna be late. (takes her hand and they  go)
Willow,(to Xander) See you at lunch.
Xander,"Cool! Oh, hey, goin' vegetarian! Huh?"
Giles,"I've been reading up on my, uh, animal possession, and I cannot  find anything anywhere about memory loss afterwards."
Xander,Did you tell them that?
Giles,(leans to Xander's ear) Your secret dies with me.
Xander,"Shoot me, stuff me, mount me."
