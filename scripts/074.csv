Anya,Please remove your clothing now.
Shot of Anya and Xander kissing. <br>Anya,"Relationship. What kind do we have, and what is it progressing toward?"
Tara,"They don't even know I exist, right?"
Willow,"I just like having something that's just, you know, mine."
Shot of Tara putting something on Willow's forehead and lips. <br>Tara Voiceover,"I am, you know."
Willow Voiceover,What?
Tara,Yours.
"(Buffy fighting a vampire. She kicks him, they exchange a few punches, she throws him across the graveyard. Riley joins in and kicks the vampire. They exchange punches as Buffy loads her crossbow. She brings it to her face and aims. Riley throws the vampire over his shoulder. Buffy lowers the crossbow to smile proudly. Riley lifts the vampire and holds him in position. Buffy fires, but a demon appears and shoves Riley out of the way, then helps the vampire up. Buffy drops her crossbow and joins the fight. She kicks the vampire and then the demon, then moves aside to regroup.) <br>BUFFY","Okay, you get Fang, I'll get Horny. (Riley looks at her.) I mean..."
"(The vampire attacks. He throws Riley over his shoulder. Riley rolls and comes up holding a stake.) <br>(Buffy kicks the demon in the chest, then a circular kick to knock him over. She kicks his knee and punches him several times in the back. Riley knees the vampire in the back. Buffy has the demon by the neck and stabs him in the back. Riley stakes the vampire and he's dust.) <br>(Buffy throws down her weapon and sighs. Riley puts his stake back in a thigh holster.) <br>BUFFY",Whoo! Vampire-demon tag team. (Brushing hair out of her face) Who says we can't all get along?
RILEY,Don't recall ever seeing that before. (Steps close to her.)
BUFFY,"It never happened. (Touching his face) Vamps ... hate demons ... (Riley strokes her hair) Like stripes and polka dots. (Running her hands down his arms) Major ... clashing. (She and Riley caressing each other) So, uh ... I guess we should tell Giles about this."
RILEY,Right.
BUFFY,"I mean, it's the kind of thing he'd ... wanna know about."
RILEY,Uh-huh.
BUFFY,"Like, as soon as possible."
RILEY,As soon as possible.
"(Cut to Riley's bedroom door opening. Riley comes in holding Buffy, kissing enthusiastically. She's pulling his shirt off.) <br>BUFFY",I mean it now. First thing... (smooch) In the morning... (smooch) We go tell Giles. (Riley's carrying her across the room.)
XANDER,"Aw, come on. Big party at Riley's house. It's gonna be fun. Why don't you wanna go? (He stops the truck)"
ANYA,You know why not. Those initiative men make me... not comfortable. And you don't care.
XANDER,"They don't even know that you're an ex-demon. And we don't know that they'd care even if they did know. Which, by the way, they're not gonna find out. (Gets up and goes into back of truck to set up) Anyways, they'll probably be too busy flirting with every other girl at the party to even notice you."
ANYA,So ... you don't think I'm desirable enough to be flirted with? (X looks surprised) Is that it?
XANDER,"I'm just not gonna win here, am I?"
ANYA,(sighs. Accusingly) You don't find me attractive any more.
XANDER,What are you talking about? I think you're gorgeous.
ANYA,"Oh, really? Well then, why didn't we have sex last night?"
XANDER,(looks up) Is that what this is about? We've gone other nights without sex.
ANYA,(angry) I know. Twice! I can't believe we're breaking up.
XANDER,Breaking- We're not! Are we?
ANYA,"Of course we are. You, you've obviously grown tired of me. I mean, I've seen it happen to thousands of women over the centuries, I just never thought it would happen to me."
XANDER,"Anya, there's a lot more to you and me than the sex. (Anya rolls her eyes) Well, there should be! I mean, a relationship is something that you work at. Work through. Together."
ANYA,"I don't understand. I'm pretty, I'm young... I mean... (stands up, walks closer) Why didn't you take advantage of me? Is something wrong with your body?"
XANDER,(getting mad) There's nothing wrong with my body.
ANYA,"Well, there must be. I saw that wrinkled man on TV talking about erectile dysfunction-"
XANDER,"Whoa! Hey. (Chuckles nervously) All systems go here. (Gesturing at his crotch) No function problem, okay?"
(Anya looks skeptical) <br>XANDER,"(claps his hands, starts unbuttoning his shirt) You want sex? Let's have sex. Right here. Hot, sweaty, big sex."
GILES,"And yet you say that the, the vampire went to the demon's aid. The two of them were working as a team?"
BUFFY,"(sitting on Riley's lap, nods) Everything except giving each other little pats on the behind."
"(We see the interior of a college lounge room. Buffy and Riley in one chair, Giles on their right, Willow and Tara on the sofa across from them.) <br>GILES","Extraordinarily odd. (Sits back, crosses his legs, gestures with the paper) As a rule, demons ... have no empathy for any of the species other than their own."
(Shot of Buffy and Riley giving each other affectionate looks) <br>GILES,"In fact, most think of (sees someone walking by, lowers his voice) vampires as ... abominations. Mixing with human blood and all."
WILLOW,So ... what brought these two together?
RILEY,Not what. Who.
GILES,(realizing) Adam. (Pulls off his glasses)
BUFFY,Think about it. Who better to bring together a bunch of ... demon types than someone who's made out of a ... bunch of demon types?
TARA,"So he's, um, bridging the gap between the races."
WILLOW,"Huh, like Martin Luther King."
(Shot of Giles raising his eyebrows skeptically) <br>GILES,"Um, (clears throat) I suggest that, uh, over the next several nights, you two (Shot of Buffy's and Riley's hands stroking each other) concentrate your patrol in that same area. If there's any other peculiar pairings or groupings, you let me know."
RILEY,"I'll let the squad know as well. They're patrolling. (To Buffy) We'll have a, uh, reserve unit out during the party."
GILES,(frown) Party?
RILEY,Tomorrow night. We're having a thing.
GILES,"At a time like this? Who, well, whose idea was that?"
RILEY,"Mine. Boys are pretty ragged, need to let off steam."
(Giles nods.) <br>GILES,Point taken.
RILEY,You're welcome to come.
GILES,"Well, much as I, uh, long for a good kegger, I have other plans. The Espresso Pump. (Sits back, looks embarrassed)"
"(Buffy and Riley exchange another amorous look, more hand stroking) <br>WILLOW",What are you doing there?
GILES,"I'm, um, uh, it's a, a meeting of, uh, grownups. It couldn't possibly be of any interest to you lot."
RILEY,"Buffy, hey, look at the time. Don't you, uh, have a class?"
BUFFY,"Yeah, in about 20 minutes."
RILEY,"Yeah, but ... I have that ... thing... (Buffy gets it)"
BUFFY,"Right, that ... thing, we could ... squeeze in ... before."
RILEY,Yeah.
(They get up) <br>BUFFY,Bye!
RILEY,Gotta run.
(Giles waves his paper) <br>WILLOW,"(stretching, grinning) They, they're probably going to- (Tara grins)"
FORREST,Didn't we just get the furnace fixed? It's freezing!
GRAHAM,"I'll call in the AM, get somebody to come-"
"(They hear a noise, turn. Walk over to Riley's door and listen. Rhythmic moaning from behind the door.) <br>FORREST","Oh, you gotta be kidding me. When do these two come up for air?"
(Graham grins.) <br>GRAHAM,Slaves to the rhythm.
FORREST,Room shoulda warmed up by now.
MASON,I been building this thing for an hour. It's still an icebox in here.
GRAHAM,"Don't bother, Mason, we got a couple of heat generators pumpin' away upstairs."
GRAHAM,Jeez!
"(Mason screams. His sleeves and the front of his shirt are on fire.) <br>(Forrest looks around, grabs a banner and uses it to extinguish the flames on Mason. Graham moves forward.) <br>FORREST",Call a medic. Get help!
SPIKE,Grr!
"(Spike leaps out, wearing his vampire face, growling. Anya jumps back with a yell. Spike looks annoyed.) <br>SPIKE","Oh, it's you. (Morphs back to human face)"
ANYA,Spike! (petulantly) What are you doing? You made me yell really high.
SPIKE,"Hey! Yeah, I did. I scared you. (Grins. Walks right up to her until his face is inches from hers) Gimme money."
ANYA,I'm not paying you for scaring me. (Pushes him away.)
SPIKE,You're not paying me. I'm robbing you.
ANYA,"Oh, well now that's just ludicrous. You can't hurt me because you've got that chip in your brain. Also, I like my money the way it is... when it's mine. (Starts to walk past him.)"
(Spike growls and spins her around.) <br>ANYA,"Oh, now come on. You're not even bumpy any more."
SPIKE,"(feels his forehead with fingers) Oh. I was just a minute ago. Hang on. (Steps back, preparing) Get me mad again."
ANYA,(sighs) Does this really work? Scaring people into giving you their money?
SPIKE,"Yeah, it works. Keeps me in blood and beers. (Grins) Plus, you know, funny. Watching those little humans quail."
ANYA,I'm beginning to understand why you're so friendless.
SPIKE,Look who's talking! (Looks her up and down) I don't see droopy boy on your arm. (Softly) Did he have better things to do?
(Shot of Buffy looking across the room and smiling.) <br>FORREST VOICEOVER,You're kidding.
"(Shot of Graham, Forrest and Riley by the stairs holding beers. Riley's looking across the room (at Buffy), not paying attention.) <br>FORREST",Mason requested to go on patrol?
GRAHAM,He just didn't want the girls to see him with his eyebrows all burnt off.
(Shot of Riley smiling across the room at Buffy.) <br>(Shot of Buffy smiling back.) <br>FORREST,He's lucky that's all he lost.
GRAHAM,"You shoulda seen it, Rye. Weird as hell."
RILEY,(not listening) Mm-hmm.
"(Forrest and Graham frown, look where Riley's looking. Cut to Buffy and the gang.) <br>WILLOW",How many kids?
XANDER,"I dunno, a whole herd of them. And some parents to boot. (Buffy glances at him, then looks past him and smiles) It was kind of embarrassing, which, welcome to life with Anya."
TARA,So you don't even know if she's coming tonight.
XANDER,"I'm thinking no. She was... pretty upset. Which, makes me wonder, is it me? Am I the crazy one? (Willow and Tara shrug at each other)"
BUFFY,"(still looking at Riley, not listening) Uh-huh. Absolutely."
(The others look where Buffy's looking.) <br>WILLOW,"Hey, Buffy, this might be a good time to mention that someone, so not me, spilled something purply on your new peasant top which I would never borrow without asking. Still love me?"
BUFFY,Uh-huh.
"(Willow and Tara look at each other and laugh.) <br>(Buffy ponders for a moment, then looks at Willow.) <br>BUFFY",Huh? What about my peasant top?
WILLOW,Nothin'.
TARA,(quickly) Xander was just talking about Anya.
(Buffy nods.) <br>XANDER,"Oh, it's nothing much. Just feeling pretty glad right now that a certain ex-demon doesn't have any powers."
SPIKE,"Yeah, tell me about it."
ANYA,"A year and a half ago, I could have eviscerated him with my thoughts. Now I can barely hurt his feelings. (Sighs) Things used to be so much simpler."
SPIKE,"(wistfully) You know ... you take the killing for granted. (Anya nods nostalgically.) And then it's gone, and you're like, ""I wish I'd appreciated it more."" Stopped and smelled the corpses, you know?"
ANYA,Yeah. Now everything's complicated.
SPIKE,"It's a terrible thing, love is. I been there myself. (Pause) It ended badly."
ANYA,"Of course it did. It always does. Seen a thousand relationships. First there's the love, and sex, and then there's nothing left but the vengeance. That's how it works."
"(Spike smiles, leans in really close.) <br>SPIKE","You and I ... should just go do the vengeance. Both of us! You eviscerate Xander, and I'll stake Dru. Like a project."
(Anya looks tempted.) <br>ANYA,I don't know. I just can't. (Sighs)
(Spike looks resigned. He takes his arm down.) <br>ANYA,(encouraging) You can go do Dru though.
SPIKE,(nods) Yeah. I will. (Sits still for a moment) Maybe later.
"(The Snobby Guy from ""Beer Bad"" is talking to a girl.) <br>SNOB","See, the thing that they're afraid to teach us about is the inherent sensuality of language. I mean, you, you learn French and they make it all about conjugations and, uh, fronted vowels ... but nobody really talks about ... you know, the way language tastes, you know, the, the way it feels, rolling over your tongue. I mean, just think about ""car"" versus ""voiture."" (He leans his hand on the wall, makes a startled face) Oh!"
(The girl looks puzzled. He stares at the wall. Shot of his hand on the wall.) <br>SNOB,Wow. (Nervous chuckle)
GIRL,Are you all right?
SNOB,"Fine! I - oh! (Gasps. The girl looks concerned.) Oh my god. Wow, wow. (Chuckle)"
GIRL,"So you really like French, huh?"
XANDER,"(reading trophy inscription) ""Lowell house. 1962."""
(Julie smiles.) <br>JULIE,Yes.
XANDER,"Um, just, you know, impressing you with my knowledge of local history. Or my knowledge of reading."
JULIE,(friendly teasing) You didn't even have to sound anything out.
XANDER,You should see me add short columns of small numbers.
(Julie laughs.) <br>JULIE,You're funny.
XANDER,"Thanks. I mean ... funny ""how amusing,"" or funny ""back away and avoid eye contact""?"
JULIE,Hmm ... kinda both.
(Xander nods.) <br>JULIE,Who are you here with?
XANDER,(shrugs) Right now I seem to be here with you.
BUFFY,"Hey, uh, can we- (points upstairs) I, um, need you to take a look at an ... essay, for ... class."
RILEY,"That ... essay, right. Here. (Hands his drink to Forrest. Forrest looks annoyed. Graham looks amused)"
RILEY,"I'll catch you guys in a minute, uh, essay ... gotta look at ... (Buffy pulling him upstairs)"
(Forrest and Graham watch them go.) <br>GRAHAM,And *I'm* the one who got a D in covert ops.
SNOB,"Hey, Evan, Evan, come here. You gotta see this."
(Evan looks confused.) <br>EVAN,I'm getting a beer.
SNOB,"No, no, no, first ... just ... put your hand right ... here. (Points at the wall)"
EVAN,"(comes over) Okay. Somehow this is a trick, I know it."
SNOB,Here. (Grabs Evan's hand and puts it on the wall. The girl watches with a grin) Now stay. Don't move. (We see some other people in the background watching and grinning)
WILLOW,"Horses, like big ... tall ... teeth that can take your arm off horses?"
TARA,"Well, sure. I learned to ride when I was a kid. It's fun. (Smiling) And, by the way, most horses don't like arm very much."
(Willow looks uncertain.) <br>WILLOW,"I had a bad birthday party pony thing when I was four. I, I look at horses and I see really big ponies."
TARA,You should ride with me sometime. I guarantee safety and fun.
(Willow smiles.) <br>WILLOW,Well... if you promise you'll look after me.
(Puts her hand on Tara's knee. Tara suddenly jumps back.) <br>TARA,Don't touch me!
(Willow frowns in confusion.) <br>TARA,That's ... just disgusting. (Standing up)
WILLOW,(standing) Tara ... what's the matter?
TARA,"(panting) I don't, I don't know."
WILLOW,"I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to ... are-are you feeling okay?"
TARA,"I'm f-fine, I just wanna ... (pointing upstairs) go to the bathroom ... (runs up the stairs)"
SPIKE,Hey ... I know these guys from somewhere.
ANYA,"Initiative soldiers, they live here. Experiments happen in the lab under the house. (Spike beginning to look nervous and angry) It's where they kept you, put in your chip. Let's have fun!"
SPIKE,(angry) What are you doing? You brought me *here*?
XANDER,(offscreen) Anya? What are you doing? (Anya turns)
XANDER,(pointing at Spike) You brought *him* here?
SPIKE,"That's what *I* said! Only I hit the ""here"" part."
XANDER,"Anya, this is crazy. (Anya crosses her arms, glares at him) We had a little fight. It just means that we have to work our way through some stuff. It doesn't mean that we rebound with the evil undead. (Spike looks offended) And what have we been doing with him anyway?"
SPIKE,"(grinning) Oh, who's the puffed-up manly man? All splotchy and possessive. (Walks over to Xander)"
ANYA,"It's not very convincing, is it?"
SPIKE,Yeah. I see now what you said about him earlier. (Looks Xander up and down) No follow-through.
XANDER,"(loudly) Hey! What a surprise! Hostile 17! (Spike trying to shut him up) Can I get you a drink, Hostile 17?"
(Spike looks around anxiously to see if anyone heard.) <br>ANYA,"Xander, stop."
"(Spike jumps back from some people who walk by. A bunch of guys walk past, ignoring them. Spike looks around.) <br>SPIKE","Pfft! (Regaining his confidence) Well, may be some fun to be had in the lion's den after all. You two keep scraping. I'll find the liquor. (Walks away)"
XANDER,Anya. What are you doing with him?
ANYA,"(angry) We didn't have sex, if that's what you mean. That's all I do now, not have sex."
XANDER,"You're overreacting. We had a fight. But see, it's okay. It's normal."
ANYA,Yes. The normal part of the ending a relationship right before the vengeance begins.
XANDER,Right. No! Vengeance?
ANYA,"Relax, I'm not gonna do it. I'm just trying to tell you that we have nothing in common besides both of us liking your penis. And now I don't even have that! So I get to say when it's done. And it's done."
XANDER,"Okay, you know what? You don't deserve to be the one to walk away from this. I've put up with a hell of a lot from you ... much of that in the last minute ... and if anyone gets to be the one to leave, it's me. (Starts to walk away)"
ANYA,(incredulously) You're leaving *me*?
XANDER,Yes. I am.
ANYA,Where are you going?
XANDER,To enjoy the party. (Walks away)
ANYA,"(yells as she pushes through the crowd, moving away from him) Well then, then I'm staying too, to, to show you how much I'm not bothered by you having fun! Because I'll be having more fun!"
XANDER,(yells across the room) I'm having fun already!
ANYA,(yells) Me too! (Unhappy face) Woo hoo! (Turns and stalks off)
XANDER,Huh. Sometimes I just don't get the sophisticated college lifestyle.
DRUNK GUY,"Hey, buddy. You look familiar."
SPIKE,Yeah. I get that a lot.
JULIE,"Hey, Xander."
XANDER,"Julie! (Looks around nervously) Okay. This, then, would be the kissing. (Nods nervously.)"
"(Julie gets on all fours and leans toward him. He moves forward, looking around for Anya, and quickly kisses her cheek.) <br>XANDER",Very smooth cheek you have there. Do you exfoliate?
"(Suddenly Julie grabs him and plants a passionate kiss on him. The others laugh and cheer. She climbs on top of him, still kissing.) <br>XANDER",Whoa! (More kissing. He grabs her arms and pulls her away.)
XANDER,Julie! What?
JULIE,I'm bad. I'm bad.
WILLOW,"Tara? It's me. (Nothing. She knocks again) Tara? (Opens door) Tara? (Walks into bathroom, looks around. The camera pans through the bathroom exactly as it did with Riley at the beginning of the episode.)"
RILEY,(panting) Was that Willow?
WILLOW,Xander? Tara? (Runs through the house. Finds Xander staring at the Spin The Bottle people.)
WILLOW,"Xander. Ghost boy. Drowning in a tub. I, I tried to save him, but, being a ghost already, well, I was way too late."
XANDER,"A ghost? (Willow nods) What's the deal? Is every frat on this campus haunted? And if so, why do people keep coming to these parties, cause it's not the snacks."
"(Tara walks up, touches Willow's arm.) <br>WILLOW","Tara, how are you?"
TARA,"I'm okay, but ... I, I don't like it here. This house ... I, I think we should go."
WILLOW,We need Buffy. (She and Xander run off. Tara follows.)
(They run upstairs.) <br>XANDER,(yells) Buffy?
WILLOW,(yells) Buffy? Riley?
RILEY,Do you wanna go back?
WILLOW,Buffy! Riley!
XANDER,Buffy!
(Tara turns and looks behind them) <br>XANDER,We gotta get them outta there.
SPIKE,"Well, this party's starting to liven up after all."
FORREST,"Graham, quit standing around! Help get these people to safety!"
GRAHAM,Touch not the impure thing...
FORREST,What?!
GRAHAM,Or ye shall perish. Find salvation in the cross of our lord and savior.
FORREST,Right. (He goes to the wall and flips a switch. Grabs Graham and turns him to face the wall as the green scanner light travels across their faces.)
COMPUTER VOICE,Retinal scan accepted.
XANDER,Anya. We gotta get out of here. Come on!
JULIE,Please help me.
FORREST,We got trouble upstairs.
(Scientist motions them to wait.) <br>SCIENTIST,"(into phone) Now. (Hangs up, starts to walk away. Forrest and Graham follow.)"
FORREST,Some sort of disembodied presence in the house.
SCIENTIST,We've been paging you.
FORREST,"Whatever this thing's outputting, it must be scrambling all the frequencies."
SCIENTIST,"Guard section 2, level 5 precautions. If the cell door locking mechanisms malfunction ... you know what to do."
FORREST,Got it.
(Scientist walks off. Forrest looks at Graham.) <br>FORREST,You with me?
GRAHAM,I'm good.
FORREST,Let's lock it down.
WILLOW,We have to go back in there.
ANYA,Why?
XANDER,Because Buffy and Riley are trapped.
ANYA,"So? (Willow and Tara look surprised) She's the Slayer, he's a big soldier boy, what do they need you for?"
XANDER,"Anya, look around! There's ghosts and shaking, and people are going all Felicity with their hair... We're fresh out of superpeople, and somebody's gotta go back in there. (Deep breath) Now who's with me?"
(Willow and Tara hesitate.) <br>SPIKE,I am.
(Everyone looks at Spike in surprise.) <br>SPIKE,"I know I'm not the first choice for heroics ... (drops his cigarette and grinds it out with his foot) and Buffy's tried to kill me more than once. And, I don't fancy a single one of you at all. But... (pauses) Actually, all that sounds pretty convincing. (Frowns, shakes his head and walks away.) I wonder if Danger Mouse is on."
ANYA,"Xander, let's get out of here."
XANDER,"You wanna bail, fine. (Points into house) I'm going back in there, and I'm not coming out till I bring my friend with me."
"(He walks to the door, opens it, peeks inside. Takes a few steps in, then something invisible pushes him out. He flies backward and lands several yards down the path. Groans and makes a pained face. Shot of Anya looking upset.) <br>XANDER",Or ... it ... could be Watcher time.
WILLOW,"We'll, we'll go to Giles'."
TARA,"No, no, wait, he, he isn't there. He was going to the Espresso Pump."
WILLOW,"Right, he-he told us not to come. He, he needed some grownup time."
GILES,(sings) No one knows what it's like
ANYA,Oh.
WILLOW,Wow.
GILES,(sings) To be fated...
XANDER,"Um, could we go back to the haunted house? Cause, this is creeping me out."
TARA,Does he do this a lot?
XANDER,Sure. Every day the earth rotates backward and the skies turn orange.
GILES,"(sings) But my dreams, they are as empty, as my conscience... (Notices the kids watching, looks embarrassed but keeps singing) seems to be..."
(Willow smiles.) <br>GILES,"(sings) I have hours, only lonely..."
WILLOW,Now I remember why I used to have such a crush on him.
GILES,(sings) ...my love is vengeance[?]...
TARA,"Well, he *is* pretty good."
GILES,(sings) ...that's never free-ee....
ANYA,(agreeing) His voice ... is pleasant. (All three girls are riveted.)
XANDER,What?!
GILES,(sings) No one knows what it's like... [unintelligible]
WILLOW,"Oh, come on, he is kinda sexy."
GILES (sings) Like I do... <br>XANDER,"I'm fighting total mental breakdown here, Will. No more fueling the fire please."
BUFFY,"You're, you're too far away from me."
RILEY,I'm right here.
GILES,"When you called to Buffy and Riley, they didn't cry out or, or respond in any way?"
ANYA,(bored) No. They're probably dead.
XANDER,Unless they're too busy doin' it to answer.
GILES,Doing what? (Sits at the table across from Xander)
XANDER,"You know, for a god of acoustic rock, you're ... kind of naive."
GILES,"(rolls his eyes) I didn't think you meant ... In the midst of all that, do you really think they were keeping it up?"
(Everyone looks at him.) <br>GILES,"Oh, for a different phrasing."
WILLOW,"Well, see, that's the thing. People all over the party were starting to act ... weird. (Quietly) Sexually."
GILES,In what way?
WILLOW,You know. (Embarrassed) Ways. (Looking through an old book)
GILES,"Well, it could be some form of, uh, succubi, or a satyr's prank. It could even be energy coming from the, the lab underneath the Lowell fraternity."
WILLOW,"It wasn't always a fraternity, look!"
(They all come to look at her book.) <br>WILLOW,"(reading) ""Between 1949 and 1960, the Lowell Home for Children housed upwards of 40 adolescents: runaways, juvenile delinquents, and emotionally disturbed teenagers from the Sunnydale area."""
TARA,"Children? Did any of them, um, die in there?"
GILES,"If there were deaths, then, uh, perhaps we're dealing with a fairly ... standard haunting."
WILLOW,"It doesn't say. It's mostly about the old house director, Genevieve Holt. ""Sunnydale Children's Aid. 30 years of community service. Giving disadvantaged kids the love and care they deserve."""
GILES,When did she die?
MRS. HOLT,"No, no, I don't mind at all. I was up. Early morning prayer."
GILES,Of course.
MRS. HOLT,And I like talking about my kids. (Sits in chair)
(Xander and Anya looking around the room) <br>MRS. HOLT,I still call them that. My kids.
GILES,"I, I suppose you were like a mother to them. (Sits on sofa) You did everything for them?"
MRS. HOLT,"Oh yes. I fed them clothed them, educated them in the way of the lord. I was given a medal."
(Xander and Anya sit on sofa beside Giles) <br>GILES,"Yes, wonderful. Uh, congratulations. Um, this'll sound a little strange, but, ah, did you notice any odd... disturbances in the house?"
MRS. HOLT,(frowns) I don't understand.
GILES,"We-well, um, like uh, furniture moving of its own accord, or, uh, objects appearing out of nowhere, or, or perhaps you saw someone appear one moment, and then they were gone the next, i-inexplicably."
MRS. HOLT,"Why, that sounds like crazy talk."
GILES,"Yes, it does, doesn't it? Yes. Um... (Looks at Xander and Anya) Well, forgive me for, for asking this, but um, the children in your care, were any of them ever ill, or did anything ever happen to any of them?"
MRS. HOLT,"Well, some had the flu and such. No one died, if that's what you mean. The engraving on the medal says how good I was with the children. (Smiles)"
GILES,"(smiles) Oh, yes."
MRS. HOLT,"I treated them as I would my own flesh and blood. Gave them hugs and praise when they were good, and ... punished them when they were dirty."
GILES,"Well, ah, children will be children. They, you know, they do like to play in the, uh, the muck. (Smiling)"
(Mrs. Holt looks disapproving.) <br>ANYA,You didn't mean mud dirty.
MRS. HOLT,"My kids didn't think I knew, but I did."
GILES,"(starting to understand) Very, uh, perceptive of you."
MRS. HOLT,Without me they would have been shut out of the kingdom. Lost to lust.
GILES,But you ... helped them.
MRS. HOLT,The girls felt the vanity more than the boys. I'd see them preening like Jezebel. Doting over their pretty hair.
XANDER,So you'd hack it off.
MRS. HOLT,I'd remove the temptation to admire themselves. (Giles removes his glasses) They were better for it.
ANYA,What about the bathtub? Something happened there.
MRS. HOLT,I performed baptisms on the most unclean. Those who were tainted with impure thought and deed.
GILES,You held them under?
MRS. HOLT,They needed to be reborn. (Rises) You choose to pass judgment on me?
GILES,"(Rises) Well, someone ought to! You traumatized and, (she waves her hand dismissively) and abused these children, children who, who have no doubt become extremely disturbed adults! (She starts to walk away; he pursues her) You have ruined lives, Mrs. Holt. Furthermore, what you did has now manifested itself as a, a malevolent presence which threatens still more lives! You have a great deal to answer for."
MRS. HOLT,I refuse to listen to this when I can smell the sin on each and every one of you. (Points to them all)
XANDER,"Yeah? You smell sin? Well let me tell you something, lady, she who smelt it dealt it!"
XANDER,"Well, that totally adds to my ""old people are crazy"" theorem."
ANYA,"I don't get it. I mean, those kids were tortured, but they weren't killed, so where are those ghosts coming from?"
GILES,I don't believe there are any ghosts.
ANYA,One ran right through me.
GILES,"Not a ghost. An apparition. I believe we're dealing with a kind of poltergeist. A whole cluster of them, in fact, born out of intense adolescent emotion and sexual energy."
ANYA,Both of which were totally pent up during Mrs. Holt's reign of repression.
XANDER,"So with Buffy and Riley having ... you know, acts of nakedness around the clock lately, maybe they set something free. Like a ... big burstin' poltergasm."
GILES,"Yes. And now the poltergeists are drawing more and more energy out of them. Feeding on them in fact. Buffy and Riley are, are powering this whole thing."
BUFFY,Don't stop. Never stop touching me.
ANYA,"What good are weapons against disembodied spirits, Xander? They have no ass to kick."
(We see Xander rummaging in Buffy's weapon chest.) <br>GILES,"She's right. (Gets up, holding a book) You should just stay outside."
WILLOW,We'll bind the spirits long enough for you to get Riley and Buffy out.
XANDER,How much time will you buy us?
TARA,"Could be tricky, we're calling upon the communal spirit of a certain time and place. (Willow lighting candles. Xander takes out weapons, hands one to Anya, holds a machete.)"
XANDER,Let's go.
XANDER,What do you feel?
ANYA,"(pressed against the window) Sad, afraid of being without you, and a little hungry."
XANDER,I meant about the house.
TARA,Give me your hands. Form a circle.
"(She and Willow and Giles hold hands, eyes closed.) <br>TARA","Children of the past, spirits of Lowell, be guided by our light. Come forth and be known to us."
GILES,Ho-how will we know when it works? (A noise. They all open their eyes and see a bunch of ghostly children standing around them.)
TARA,We'll know.
XANDER,House is clean.
ANYA,Let's go. You first.
"(Xander takes a breath, walks in. Anya follows. They look up. The entire staircase is covered in the leafy, spiny vines.) <br>XANDER",We need to work fast. Never know how long before the munchkins get homesick.
ANYA,Or the human battery conks out.
"(They start walking up the stairs, through the vines.) <br>XANDER",Watch your fingers.
GILES,Find it in your hearts to leave our friends passage.
WILLOW,Transform your pain. Release your past. And ... uh ... get over it.
XANDER,You okay?
TARA,"(yelling) Find here the serenity you seek, the peace you -"
(The red-covered table flies out from under their hands and crashes against the door. The wind stops. They look around.) <br>GILES,What's happened?
TARA,We lost them.
ANYA,Xander!
ANYA,"Shut up, repressed crybabies!"
(A huge thorn suddenly sprouts from the vine her hand is resting on. The thorn goes right through the middle of her hand. She screams.) <br>ANYA,Ow!!
XANDER,"Come on, we just gotta-"
(A vine knocks him down.) <br>ANYA,Xander!
(Anya helps him up and they continue fighting their way through the vines.) <br>ANYA,We can make it through this.
(The push on cautiously. A bunch of vines wrap around Anya.) <br>ANYA,"Xander, get it off!"
"(The howling noises stop.) <br>(Shot of Xander and Anya framed in the doorway.) <br>(Buffy and Riley in bed, naked. The light from the doorway illuminates them. They sit up, clutching the sheets against themselves.) <br>BUFFY",Xander! Don't you knock?
BUFFY,I just had no idea. It's so creepy! (Looks up at the others) He was really singing?
(Willow nods.) <br>XANDER,"I'd say it was more like crooning. (To Anya) If we grow old together, remind me to skip the midlife crisis. (Puts his hand on her knee.)"
ANYA,"(smiling, softly) Okay. (They look affectionately at each other.)"
WILLOW,"Come on, you have to admit, it was kinda sexy."
XANDER,Please stop saying that. I'm willing to offer cash incentives.
RILEY,We're just lucky no one got injured. (Looking at Buffy) No thanks to us.
WILLOW,Don't be too hard on yourself.
BUFFY,"He's right, Will. If Riley and I hadn't ... gotten so wrapped up in each other, none of this would've happened."
ANYA,True. Feel shame.
(Riley looks like he is doing just that.) <br>XANDER,My girlfriend. Mistress of the learning plateau.
WILLOW,"Really, it wasn't your fault. You were under the influence of powerful magicks."
BUFFY,We were like zombies. I had no control over myself at all.
WILLOW,Must have been horrible.
"(Buffy looks sidelong at Riley.) <br>(Riley looks at her, looks down.) <br>BUFFY",Yeah. Horrible.
(They both nod firmly.) <br>RILEY,Uh-huh.
BUFFY,Mm-hmm.
RILEY,It was bad.
