GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
SPIKE VOICEOVER,"Buffy, I love you."
WILLOW,We conjure the goddess Thespia to help us locate demonic energy.
TARA,Are you sure we're ready for that?
WILLOW,Or not.
GLORY,Tell me ... where ... the key is.
MONK,The key is energy. It's a portal. My brethren sent it to you.
BUFFY,Dawn. She's not my sister?
MONK,She doesn't know that.
WILLOW VOICEOVER,Tell me a story.
TARA VOICEOVER,"Okay. Once upon a time, there was, um ... a kitty. She was very little, and she was all alone, and nobody wanted her."
WILLOW VOICEOVER,This is a very upsetting story.
TARA VOICEOVER,"Oh, oh, but it gets better."
TARA VOICEOVER,"'Cause one day the kitty was running around in the street and a man came, and swooped her up..."
TARA,And took her to the pound.
TARA,"And at the pound there were lots of other kitties, and there were puppies, and some ferrets..."
WILLOW,(smiling) Were there dolphins?
TARA,(handing kitten to Willow) Yes. Many dolphins at the pound.
WILLOW,Or was there a camel?
TARA,(thinks) There was the front of a camel. A half camel. (Smiles)
WILLOW,(cuddling kitten) Did the kitty get chosen by some nice people?
TARA,"Well, now you ruined the ending."
WILLOW,Mmm... (lets go of the kitten and it runs off) I'm sleepy.
TARA,Do you mind if I keep the light on? I was gonna look up some spells.
WILLOW,It's fine. (pouts) I don't need to be snuggled. (smiles)
TARA,(smiles back) Vixen!
WILLOW,You've been spell gal night and day lately.
TARA,"Well, I just wanna keep up with you, and I'm ... well, I just like to be useful. You know, to the gang? (Willow looks concerned) I just ... never ... feel useful."
WILLOW,You are. You're essential.
TARA,Do you think Buffy found out anything tonight?
WILLOW,"At the factory? I don't know. If there was something, I figured she'd call us."
GILES,"Uh, I don't know what to say."
BUFFY,Tell me about it. (looks toward the stairs)
GILES,She has no idea?
BUFFY,No. She thinks she's my kid sister.
GILES,Are you going to tell her?
BUFFY,"How can I? (sighs, gets up) She'd freak, and that's the last thing we need."
BUFFY,(sighs) We have to keep her safe.
GILES,"This ... woman, this, uh, whatever she was... she knows you now. (Buffy sits) Should we be thinking about ... sending Dawn away?"
BUFFY,Away where?
GILES,"I don't know, uh ... your father's?"
BUFFY,"(scoffs) Yeah, he's, um ... in Spain, with his secretary. Living the cliche. (Giles looks sympathetic.) I called him when Mom got sick, he hasn't even..."
GILES,I'm sorry.
BUFFY,"When he bailed on us ... I remember, Dawn cried for a week. Except she didn't. She wasn't there, but ... I can still feel what it was like."
BUFFY,"They sent her to me, Giles. I think ... I have to take care of her. I want to."
GILES,Do we tell the others?
BUFFY,"No. No one. They-they'd act weird around her, and it's, it's safer for everyone if they don't know."
GILES,"Yes. (Stands, begins to pace) We have to find out who this woman is, and what she needs Dawn for."
GILES,"I mean, if she comes after you-"
BUFFY,She'll come. (Looks toward the stairs) She'll come for us.
GLORY,Okay. Now I'm upset.
XANDER,Ow! Thumb! Necessary opposable thumb!
RILEY,Sorry. Crybaby.
BUFFY,"You know what, you guys, just leave it here."
RILEY,Got it.
DAWN,I don't need help.
BUFFY,Just be careful.
ANYA,But we just helped her move the stuff in a few days ago... (turns and sees Buffy) ...and it was fun!
GILES,"(reading a book) People help each other out, Anya. It's one of our strange customs."
BUFFY,"Giles, I noticed you're doing the smallest amount of helping that can actually be called helping."
GILES,"Well, I saw myself in more of a ... patriarchal sort of role. You know, lots of pointing and scowling. (Smiles. Looks to his left, points and scowls.) You two, stop that!"
RILEY,He started it.
XANDER,He called me a bad name. (Tara looks at them and grins) I think it was bad. It might've been Latin.
GILES,"Stop it, or you're going to break something."
BUFFY,Or I'm going to break something.
XANDER,Still can't believe you're giving up this cherry corner suite.
ANYA,(re-entering from hallway) Just a few days after we moved you in!
BUFFY,"(shrugs, tries to look casual) It's no big. (Giles looks up from his book) You know, with Mom not being well, I'm hardly ever here. (Picks up a pile of clothes to put in a box) Just figured I'd ... save a little cash for this semester, that's all."
WILLOW,I think that's smart.
XANDER,"Still, it's hard to give up. You've got the two entrances (pointing to the two doors to the room) lot of opportunity for bawdy French farce, and everybody loves bawdy-"
BUFFY,Where's Dawn?
RILEY,I think she just walked out. (Points out one of the doors)
BUFFY,(hurrying forward) Dawn!
DAWN,Some of your CDs are my CDs.
BUFFY,I know. Come help me fold.
RILEY,Starting to feel that fight?
BUFFY,Nothing like gettin' your ass kicked to ... make your ass hurt.
DAWN,You'll totally take her next time.
XANDER,"'Cause you'll have backup, baby. She's messin' with all of us."
GILES,"Yes, uh, we'll, we'll, uh, find her weaknesses, and then, uh-"
TARA,"Yeah. You learn her source, (grins) and, uh, we'll introduce her to her insect reflection."
TARA,"Um ... that, that was funny if you, um, studied Taglarin mythic rites... (softly) and are a complete dork."
RILEY,"Oh, then how come Xander didn't laugh? (Tara takes a box and exits)"
XANDER,(not realizing he's been insulted) I don't know that Taglarin stuff.
RILEY,Oh.
WILLOW,Hey. You wanna start taking stuff down to the car?
TARA,(nods) Yeah.
WILLOW,Okay.
TARA,(whispering to herself) Stupid...
WILLOW,"Okay. Guys, now remember, you have to be at the Bronze by eight."
BUFFY,Bronze.
WILLOW,Tomorrow night! Tara's birthday!
BUFFY,Right! Right.
ANYA,"(to Xander) We have to bring presents, right? Birth is a present thing?"
XANDER,"I got something ... picked out, yeah."
WILLOW,"(anxious) You-you guys can all still come, right? I mean, I know there's ... this new evil and all, but..."
BUFFY,"No, no. We'll be there. I could definitely use a break from all this craziness."
BEN,What's the story?
INTERN,Another crazy. Got her family out there. (nods toward waiting room)
BEN,"OK, let me guess, no history of mental problems."
INTERN,Yeah. That makes like five this month.
BEN,"Ah, they told me Sunnydale was gonna be interesting."
INTERN,(chuckles) Yeah. Aren't you off?
BEN,"(looks at watch) Yeah, as of now. Have fun."
GLORY,I need a favor.
ANYA,(smiling) Thank you for coming. We value your patronage. (Yelling after the departing customer) Please come again for more purchases!
GILES,"Could we please be a little less effusive, Anya? Don't want to frighten the people."
ANYA,"I'm just so excited. They come in, I help them ... they give us money in exchange for goods ... you give me money for working for you ... I have a place in the world now. I'm part of the system. (smiles widely) I'm a working gal."
GILES,"(smiles) Yes. Well, why don't you start organizing the shipping orders. (Takes the box and starts to walk off)"
ANYA,"Oh, no, that's boring. I just want to do the money parts."
BUFFY,"Well, sure I forgot about the party. I mean, there's kind of a lot going on. And it's not ... you know ... the most thrilling social event of the season."
XANDER,"(nods) Yeah ... it's a big deal for Willow, though. I mean, you are gonna be there?"
BUFFY,Yeah. (shrugs) Barring monsters.
ANYA,"Hey, hi. (Leans over the counter toward Xander)"
XANDER,Gimme sugar. I've come to buy sugar.
ANYA,Mmm. We value your patronage.
BUFFY,"(to Giles) So, any breakthroughs on the identity of Miss Congeniality?"
GILES,"Well, I have narrowed it down somewhat."
BUFFY,Your definition of narrow is impressively wide.
GILES,"Well, you didn't give me much to go on. She-she looks human, so the mug shots aren't any use, and, uh, you can't be more specific about what she's like?"
BUFFY,"(ponders) She was kinda like Cordelia, actually. (Giles nods thoughtfully) I'm pretty sure she dyes her hair."
GILES,"Right! That one, of course. Our work is done."
BUFFY,There must be something on her. (sits at table as Xander approaches)
XANDER,(melodramatically) The answer is somewhere here. (stares at the book-covered table) It's right in front of us and we're too blind to see it! (Slams his hand down on the table)
XANDER,"I'm helping, I'm reading, (sits, whispers) I'm quiet."
BUFFY,So ... what'd you get her?
XANDER,Huh?
BUFFY,Tara. You said you got a present already.
XANDER,"Yeah, that was a tangled web of lies, sweetie. I'm not really sure what kind of thing she'd ... I mean, I don't really know her that well."
BUFFY,(nods) I know.
XANDER,"(quickly) I mean, she's nice."
BUFFY,"(quickly) Yeah! Yeah, nice ... nice. I-it's just, I-I sort of..."
XANDER,I don't necessarily get her ... but she's really nice.
BUFFY,Yeah. There's ... just that thing.
XANDER,(agreeing) That thing.
BUFFY,That ... thing of not understanding-
XANDER,Half of what she says?
BUFFY,As for example. But she's super nice.
XANDER,You betcha.
BUFFY,"Think there'll be a lot of Wiccas there, heavy Wiccan crowd?"
XANDER,"Well, that's sort of her deal. Her and Willow are all Wiccie. Swingin' with the Wiccan lifestyle."
BUFFY,Which is cool.
XANDER,"Well, yeah."
BUFFY,"I just hope we fit in, not awkward."
XANDER,"With Willow it's like, she's got this ... whole new thing in her life. But she's still Willow, so I can always figure her out. But Tara, I just know she likes Willow, and she already has one of those."
BUFFY,Ugh! I have a present-buying headache. Tara's damn birthday is just one too many things for me to worry about.
XANDER,Relax. You should take a few minutes. (jerks his thumb toward the training room in the back) Train or stretch out. You should do something to ... work off the tension.
SPIKE,"You want me, Slayer, come and get me."
BUFFY,"Oh, I'm coming. I'm coming right- (lunges up toward him)"
HARMONY,-now!
HARMONY,What are you thinking?
SPIKE,"All about you, baby."
HARMONY,Aww. (Pulls Spike's head down to her shoulder) You're my little lamb.
GILES,Come up with anything yet?
XANDER,"Well, candles, maybe, or bath oils of some kind."
BUFFY,"I saw a really cute sweater at Bloomy's ... but, I think I want me to have it."
GILES,And you are talking about what on earth?
BUFFY,Tara's birthday. We're at a loss.
GILES,"You're in a magic shop, and you can't think what Tara would like. I believe you're both profoundly stupid."
XANDER,"Well, we don't really know ... the kind of things witches like. What, are we gonna get her some cheesy crystal ball?"
GILES,Bloody well better not. I've got mine already wrapped.
DONNY,"Uh, are all these magic books?"
GILES,"Uh, private collection. Uh, books for sale are against the walls over there. (gestures with his coffee cup, then walks toward the counter)"
DONNY,"So all these books got spells in 'em? Turn people into frogs, things like that?"
XANDER,"Yeah, we're building a race of frog people. It's a good time."
DONNY,"So, uh... (gestures at them) You all witches? Hey, don't do a spell on me now. (Laughs)"
GILES,Was there something in particular you were looking for?
WILLOW,Her insect reflection. That is so good.
TARA,"I just thought that'd be funny, you know, if her center of power was-"
DONNY,Whatta you know.
DONNY,What's the matter? You don't have a hug for your big brother?
WILLOW,Brother?
TARA,"Willow, this is (stutters) Donny."
WILLOW,Hi.
DONNY,"(shakes Willow's hand, smiling) Nice to meet you."
TARA,"And, uh, these are my-my friends."
DONNY,"What, uh, all of you hang out? Wow. That's more people than you met in high school. (Gives Tara a friendly punch on the arm)"
TARA,"How did you fi - I, I mean, how come you came?"
DONNY,"Well, duh, birthday girl. Uh, we came down in the camper, been all over the campus."
TARA,We?
DONNY,Look what I found! (gesturing at Tara)
TARA,"Uh, Dad, hi. (walks forward. Willow watches)"
MR. MACLAY,"Well, here's my girl."
TARA,S-such a s-surprise.
DONNY,Yes.
TARA,Cousin Beth.
BETH,Hey.
MR. MACLAY,One of your dorm-mates said I might ... find you here. (looking around)
TARA,"Oh. Oh, um, (turning toward the others) these are, these are friends. Um, this is Mr. Giles, um, he runs the shop."
GILES VOICEOVER,How do you do?
MR. MACLAY,"Pleasure. Well, I, I don't mean to interrupt your plans, I know we've come on you kind of suddenly, but I thought we could have dinner."
TARA,Okay.
MR. MACLAY,"Why don't I pick you up at six, And we'll ... (glances at the others) do some catching up."
TARA,"Yes, sir."
MR. MACLAY,(to the others) Forgive me for running out. We're double-parked.
DONNY,(waving from doorway) Nice to meet you all.
WILLOW,That's so weird. Your ... whole family.
TARA,(smiles nervously) Yeah.
WILLOW,(OS) They seem nice.
TARA,"You know, they-they're okay. Families are always-"
WILLOW,(understandingly) They make you crazy.
TARA,Usually. Wanna get into research mode?
WILLOW,Sure.
Cut to,"interior foyer of Joyce's house, day. Buffy enters through the front door, tossing her keys onto a table."
BUFFY,"(calling) Honey, I'm home."
RILEY,(coming down the stairs) Did you have a good day at work?
BUFFY,It's a rat race.
RILEY,I squared away the rest of your stuff. Wouldn't even know you ever left.
BUFFY,"Oh, you're a god. You're like the ... god of boyfriends."
RILEY,"Nah, I just like it when you owe me favors."
BUFFY,"Well, this earns you a big favor. There could be outfits."
RILEY,Ooh. Be still my heart.
DAWN,See ya later.
BUFFY,"Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where do you think you're going?"
DAWN,I'm going to Melinda's for dinner.
BUFFY,Since when?
DAWN,Now-ish.
BUFFY,You can't. I-it's not safe for you to walk there.
DAWN,"It's just across the street. What is the big deal, I'm just gonna go-"
BUFFY,"No. It's family night. (glances at Riley) And besides, Melinda's a bad influence. I don't like you hanging out with someone that ... short."
DAWN,(annoyed) I am so glad you're moving back into the house. This is the source of my gladness.
BUFFY,She makes me crazy. (Walks past Riley into the living room)
RILEY,That's ... kinda the word I was searching for.
BUFFY,(sits on sofa) What? She shouldn't be going over there.
RILEY,"Yeah, a lot of young people nowadays are experimenting with shortness. Gotta nip that in the bud."
BUFFY,She ... can't be running out whenever she'd like.
RILEY,(walks forward) It's more than that.
BUFFY,What do you mean?
RILEY,"(sits next to her, shakes his head) You tell me."
BUFFY,We all have to be careful. This ... demon chick is ... exciting and new. I don't know what I'm up against.
RILEY,"If we're in trouble here I could contact Graham, maybe get the government boys on it-"
BUFFY,"No! No, I-I-I don't want them anywhere near this."
RILEY,(annoyed) Just a suggestion.
BUFFY,"Look, the fewer people that are involved, the safer I will feel."
RILEY,Every time I think I'm getting close to you ... (shakes head) I gotta take off. (Gets up)
BUFFY,(gets up to follow) Wait! What?
RILEY,(walking toward front door) I'll call you later.
BUFFY,Riley! (He stops walking) I *want* you to help. I'm not-
RILEY,"Yeah. Know you got a lot on your mind. You decide you wanna let me in on any of it, (opens door) let me know. I'll come running."
MR. MACLAY,"The door wasn't locked. I was a little early. (looks around) I suppose you ... wanted me to see all these ... (picks up a large crystal and examines it) toys. (puts crystal down) You don't even try to hide it any more. I'd hoped maybe you'd gotten over the whole witchcraft thing. That if we let you go, you'd ... get it out of your system. (puts hands in pockets) Then they told me to look for you in ... (disgusted) that store."
TARA,"I didn't - I, I didn't kn-know that you were coming."
MR. MACLAY,Of course we came. We haven't heard from you in months. Your birthday's getting closer and closer. You know what that means.
TARA,"(upset) I don't think it's ... (stammers) it, it won't mean that-"
MR. MACLAY,You're turning twenty. (walks toward her) It's the same age your mother was when she... Do your friends even know?
TARA,(softly) Y-yes.
MR. MACLAY,"Are you lying to me? (Tara looks down) Tara, you're coming home with us. You know it's the only way."
TARA,Home?
MR. MACLAY,You can't control what's going to happen. You have evil inside of you and it will come out. And letting yourself work all this magic is only going to make it worse. Where do you think that power comes from?
TARA,It ... it doesn't feel evil ... sir.
MR. MACLAY,"Evil never does. (Tara looks down, upset) I don't feel much like eating right now. (Starts to walk past her) I'll give you some time, but we need to be gone by morning. (Walks to the door. We see him unfocused in the background; in foreground Tara looking sad) Your family loves you, Tara, no matter what. How do you think your friends are going to feel when they see your true face?"
GLORY,(OS) Finally. I thought you were gonna nap the whole day away. (Demon growls and struggles) Stop whining.
GLORY,"You know, I remember when the Lei-Ach were a proud warrior race, not sneaking around hospitals looking for weak sickly types to suck the bone marrow from. (Demon growls and struggles) But ... let's talk about my problems for thirty seconds, if that's perfectly all right with you."
GLORY,"Blonde ... short ... strong for a human ... (turns back around, sits on chair, speaks angrily to demon) and massively rude! Broke my shoe, took my monk, do you have any idea who I'm talking about?"
GLORY,"A slayer?? Oh god, please don't tell me I was fighting a vampire slayer! (Puts one hand to her forehead) How unbelievably common! If I had friends, and they heard about this ... (Shot of the demon looking like it's going to fall asleep again) and you know she's going around telling everybody, I mean she probably just- (leaps up and grabs the demon by the throat) Pay attention! I am great and I am beautiful, and when I walk into a room all eyes turn to me, because my name is a holy name, and you will listen! (Removes her hand from demon's throat, strokes his hair with both hands) Get your friends ... find the girl ... kill the girl ... okay baby? (Demon nods. She smiles and looks closer at it) You have the cutest little suppurating sores! Has anyone ever told you that?"
Cut to,"some sort of irregularly shaped crystal ball. Camera pulls out and we see Tara sitting in her room, staring sadly at the crystal. Behind her the door opens and Willow enters. Tara doesn't turn."
WILLOW,Hey.
TARA,(turning) Hey.
WILLOW,Was dinner fun?
WILLOW,"Well, there's Scoobyage afoot. Giles called a meeting about our spankin' new menace."
TARA,"Oh ... y-you should go, they don't need me for that. You can fill me in."
WILLOW,"(walks toward her) No, no, you have to come. This demon chick is supposed to be really powerful, and I was thinking. Maybe we could try that, that spell, you know, the one to find demons?"
TARA,That didn't work.
WILLOW,"Yeah ... but we only tried it once, and I-I think I got some ingredients wrong."
TARA,"Well, I-I'm tired. Maybe we can do it tomorrow?"
WILLOW,You sure you don't wanna-
TARA,"Look, my family's here, okay, I can't just- (pauses) Not everything is about your friends and stuff."
WILLOW,"(makes a face) Sorry. (Backs away from Tara, starts walking to the door)"
TARA,"No! No, I mean... (Willow turns back) There's just so much ... going on. It's just ... I'm, I'm really tired."
WILLOW,(nods) Okay.
TARA,I'll see you in the morning. You can fill me in.
WILLOW,Great. We'll be demon hunters. (Leaves)
WILLOW,Hey. Am I late? Did I miss any exposition?
GILES,"(enters the shot from the right) No, no, no, no, nothing earth-shattering to relate. (leans his hands on the back of a chair as Willow sits) I just have a few thoughts, and, uh, wanted to make sure that we were all on the same page."
DAWN,Can I buy one of these?
BUFFY,(OS) No.
DAWN,With my own money?
BUFFY,"(OS) I let you come, now sit down and look studious."
GILES,"(OS) Well, first of all, I want to talk to you about ... safety. Um, this creature could be-"
BUFFY,"(OS, fading) Will be."
GILES,"(OS, fading) Will be coming after Buffy, and possibly all of us."
TARA,"(whispering) Blind Cadria, desolate queen, work my will upon them all. Your curse upon them, my obeisance to you."
GILES,"Now, I may have a lead on this monk that Buffy spoke of. There, there are a few orders that I-I've read up on-"
GILES,"I-I'm sorry, where was I?"
BUFFY,The monk.
GILES,"Yes, um, I'd like us all to start looking at these orders, I-it's possible whichever one this monk belonged to was wiped out entirely..."
BARTENDER,"You shouldn't be coming in here. (Turns and takes a glass from a shelf) You got a rep with these monsters.  (Puts glass on the bar, shakes head) But you come in here... (turns and gets a bottle) night after night. (Pours into the glass, looks up at the customer) Are you lookin' to get killed?"
RILEY,"I come for the ambiance. (picks up glass, looks around) What can I say? This place just reeks of class. (Drinks the shot)"
BARTENDER,"Yeah, well, if Willy was here-"
RILEY,"Well, Willy's not here. (puts glass down) Hit me."
FEMALE VOICE,Drinking alone?
SANDY,It's not a good sign. (Sits on the stool next to him)
RILEY,"So they tell me. (looks at her) I buy you a drink, neither one of us has that problem any more, now do we? (Sips his drink)"
SANDY,Vodka tonic.
RILEY,(to bartender) Vodka tonic.
SANDY,(to Riley) I'm Sandy.
RILEY,Riley.
SANDY,This place is such a dive.
RILEY,"No no, it's great. You just have to close your eyes, (Sandy chuckles) plug up your nostrils, it's fine."
SANDY,We ... could go somewhere else. Someplace more ... private.
RILEY,"(sighs, stares off into the distance) Ohhhh, Sandy, Sandy. It's no good. My heart belongs to another. Besides, (looks at her again) I don't go out with vampires."
RILEY,(to bartender) Never interested in my intellect.
HARMONY,Hi baby!
SPIKE,"(bored) Hello, sweetbreads. Have fun?"
HARMONY,"Uhh, it was so exciting. You wouldn't believe it. I went to April Fool's, and absolutely everything was on sale."
SPIKE,You *paid* for it?
HARMONY,"(unpacking bags) Oh, no. I just killed the clerk. Still, a bargain's a bargain. (Spike frowns and shakes his head) Oh, I ran into Carol Beets. You know. She sired Brandon, Brandon from the sewer gang ... and she said, the Lei-Ach demon... (happily) was recruiting his brethren to kill the slayer!"
SPIKE,(suddenly paying attention) How's that?
HARMONY,"Apparently, he got recruited by some big nether-wig and now he's on a mission. (Spike looks thoughtful) You think they might actually do it? Kill her?"
SPIKE,"(pondering) God, that would be ... pleasant."
HARMONY,"Well, if they do, I think we should do something. (Spike jumps up) Like a gift basket or something. (Spike grabs his jacket) Where are you going?"
SPIKE,To get a decent seat. (puts on jacket) If the slayer's gonna die ... I'm gonna watch. (Exits)
BETH,Tara.
TARA,"Beth, what are you-"
BETH,I-I was looking for you.
TARA,I'm sorry we didn't get to have dinner.
BETH,I just ... wanted to see if everything was okay. (Tara smiles) See if you needed any help with anything. Packing.
TARA,"(stops smiling) Beth, I'm not, I'm n-not (stutters) coming back with you."
BETH,You're not?
TARA,I-I don't think so.
BETH,You ... selfish bitch!
TARA,What?!
BETH,"You don't care the slightest bitty bit about your family, do you? Your dad's been worried sick about you every day since you've been gone. There's a, a house that needs taking care of ... Donny and your dad having to do for themselves while you're down here living god knows what kind of lifestyle. (Tara looks upset) I can't wait till your little friends find out the truth about you. And they will, you know. No matter how innocent you act, they'll see."
TARA,(firmly) No they won't.
BETH,They will. Unless you ... do some kind of spell on them .... (sees Tara's face) You did!
TARA,N-no!
BETH,You did something to them. I'm telling your father.
TARA,"No! No, it wasn't anything!"
BETH,You think you can just go around cursing people? Your dad's gonna pop.
TARA,It was just so they wouldn't see. So-so-so they wouldn't see the demon part of me. (teary) Please don't tell Dad. It's harmless.
WILLOW,Tara?
WILLOW,(to herself) I thought I heard something. (Shrugs and walks off)
BETH,"Don't you see how out of control you are? You've been lying to these people for a year, and now you've put a spell on them, is that right? (shakes head) Is that a human thing to do? Now I'm telling your father. If he doesn't force you to come home, and I think he should, I know he's going to tell your friends the truth. If I were you, I'd tell them first. And then I'd tell them good-bye."
ANYA,"Do I get paid overtime for this? (Gets up and walks right past the demon, not noticing it)"
GILES,"(OS) Certainly not. (comes into the shot, walking past the demon as a second demon joins it) Dawn, would you close the door?"
DAWN,(OS) I didn't open it.
Shot of the room from Buffy's POV,"it's empty, no demons."
BUFFY,Giles!
BUFFY,(OS) Something's in here!
ANYA,Where'd it go??
GILES,"Under there, go."
DAWN,Willow? (crawls under the desk)
Shot of the workout room from Buffy's POV,it's empty. She rushes toward the door. Shot of Spike still on the floor with the demon in a stranglehold.
SPIKE,You're welcome!
ANYA,Where'd it go?! (swinging her weapon around randomly)
XANDER,It's over there!
GILES,How many are there?
ANYA,I've already been injured once this month!
BUFFY,Shut up! (Music stops. Silence as Buffy looks around.)
TARA,"Buffy, behind you!"
BUFFY,"Tara, where is it? (looking around) Can you see it?"
TARA,"Oh, god."
TARA,"(panting) Blind Cadria, lift your veil. Give evil form... (The demon turns away from Buffy to glare at Tara) ...and break my spell."
MR. MACLAY,Tara!
MR. MACLAY,What in god's name is that?
SPIKE,Lei-ach demon. (Everyone looks at him) Fun little buggers. Big with the marrow-sucking.
MR. MACLAY,I don't understand.
BUFFY,"(arms folded, looking down at Tara) I'm not sure I do either."
TARA,"I'm sorry. I'm s-s-so sorry. (sniffling) I was, I was trying to hide."
TARA,I didn't want you to see ... what I am.
WILLOW,"Tara, what?"
BUFFY,"What do you mean, what you are?"
MR. MACLAY,(OS) Demon. The women in our family... (Everyone looks up at him) have demon in them. Her mother had it. That's where the magic comes from.
MR. MACLAY,"We came to take her home before... (sighs) well, before things like ... (points at the dead demon) this started happening."
GILES,"You cast a spell on us, to keep us from seeing your ... demon side. (to Buffy) That's why we couldn't see our attackers."
BUFFY,Nearly got us killed.
TARA,I'll go. (scrambles to her feet. To Buffy) I'm very sorry.
MR. MACLAY,The camper's outside.
WILLOW,"Wait! Go? (grabs Tara's elbow) I, she just did a spell that went wrong. It-it was just a mistake."
MR. MACLAY,That's not the point and it's not your concern. She belongs with us. We know how to control her ... problem.
WILLOW,"Tara ... look at me. (Tara does.) I, I trusted you more than anyone in my life. Was all that just a lie?"
TARA,(teary) No!
WILLOW,"Well, do you wanna leave?"
MR. MACLAY,"It's not your decision, young lady."
WILLOW,"(sharply to him) I know that! (more softly, to Tara) Do you wanna leave?"
MR. MACLAY,"You're going to do what's right, Tara. Now, I'm taking you out of here before somebody *does* get killed. (Tara wipes her face on her sleeve) The girl belongs with her family. I hope that's clear to the rest of you."
BUFFY,(OS) It is.
BUFFY,"You want her, Mr. Maclay? You can go ahead and take her."
BUFFY,You just gotta go through me.
MR. MACLAY,(OS) What?
BUFFY,(OS) You heard me.
BUFFY,You wanna take Tara out of here against her will? You gotta come through me.
DAWN,And me!
MR. MACLAY,Is this a joke? (steps down one of the stairs) I'm not gonna be threatened by two little girls.
DAWN,You don't wanna mess with us.
BUFFY,She's a hair-puller.
GILES,"And ... (puts on his glasses) you're not just dealing with, uh, two little girls."
XANDER,You're dealing with all of us.
SPIKE,'Cept me.
XANDER,'Cept Spike.
SPIKE,I don't care what happens.
MR. MACLAY,This is insane. You people have no right to interfere with Tara's affairs. *We* ... are her blood kin! Who the hell are you?
BUFFY,We're family.
DONNY,"Daaad. You -- you gonna let 'em just... (stomps forward) Tara, if you don't get in that car, I swear by god I will beat you down."
XANDER,"And I swear by your full and manly beard, you're gonna break something trying. (Donny looks cowed)"
BETH,Well. I hope you'll all be happy hanging out with a disgusting demon.
ANYA,E-excuse me. What kind?
BETH,What?
ANYA,"What kind of demon is she? There's a lot of different kinds. Some are very, very evil. And some have been considered to be useful members of society. (Smiles proudly. Xander turns to smile back at her.)"
BETH,"Well, I-I ... what does it matter?"
MR. MACLAY,Evil is evil.
ANYA,"Well, let's just narrow it down. (Xander nods)"
SPIKE,Ohhh. (looks around) Why don't I make this simple.
SPIKE,Oww!!
WILLOW,(angry) Hey! (suddenly realizing) Hey...
TARA,(both hands over her face) He hit my nose!
WILLOW,"And it hurt! Uh, him, I mean."
BUFFY,(to Mr. Maclay) And that only works on humans. (Willow smiles)
SPIKE,"There's no demon in there. That's just a family legend, am I right? (Mr. Maclay looks angry) Just a bit of spin to keep the ladies in line. (smirks) Oh, you're a piece of work. I like you."
TARA,"(softly, to Willow) I'm not a demon."
WILLOW,(smiling) You're not a demon.
TARA,He hurt my nose.
WILLOW,Aw.
SPIKE,"(still rubbing his forehead) Yeah, you're welcome. (Stalks off)"
GILES,"Mr. Maclay, I would say your business here is finished."
MR. MACLAY,Tara. (Tara looks at him) For eighteen years your family has taken care of you and supported you. If you wanna turn your back-
TARA,(walking forward) Dad ... just go.
MR. MACLAY,(disgusted) Magic.
BETH,Are you happy now?
RILEY,Sorry I'm late.
BUFFY,(smiling) You came.
RILEY,Of course I came.
TARA,"No, see, 'cause your insect reflection represents your insignificance... (Anya nods) in terms of the karmic cycle."
ANYA,But it's still not funny.
DAWN,"(with her back to the others, watching the crowd) This place is so cool. (looks at hand) 'Cept I have to wear this stupid stamp on my hand."
XANDER,That's to keep you from boozing it up.
DAWN,Oh please. Only losers drink alcohol.
ANYA,So what's an eagle reflection?
TARA,Umm...
WILLOW,My dance?
WILLOW,Good birthday?
TARA,Best birthday.
WILLOW,I still can't believe you didn't tell me about your family and all that.
TARA,"I was just afraid if you saw the kind of people I came from, you wouldn't wanna be anywhere near me."
WILLOW,"See ... that's where you're a dummy. I think about ... what you grew up with, and ... then I look at what you are ... it makes me proud. It makes me love you more."
TARA,Every time I- (takes a deep breath) even when I'm at my worst ... you always make me feel special.
TARA,How do you do that?
WILLOW,Magic.
SINGER,I can't take my eyes off you.... I can't take my eyes off you....
Executive Producer,Joss Whedon.
