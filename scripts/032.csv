Xander,"All I'm saying is, it's a stupid idea to have a victory party  at the beach. It's officially nippy. (looks down at himself) So say my  nips."
Willow,I think it's festive. A party with nature.
Cordelia,"Well, it's the team's choice. It was their victory."
Xander,"Team? Swim team. (chuckles) Hardly what I'd call a team. The  Yankees. Abbott and Costello. The 'A'. Now, those were teams."
Cordelia,Jealous?
Xander,"No. Y-yes, but 'no' more than 'yes'."
Xander,"I mean, look at that. (indicates them) Dodd McAlvy. Last month  he's the freak with Jicama breath who waxes his back. He wins a few  meets and suddenly inherits the cool gene?"
Cordelia,"Well, all I know is, my cheerleading squad wasted a lot of  pep on losers. It's about time our school excelled at something."
Willow,Hmm. You're forgetting our high mortality rate.
Xander,(pumps his fist) We're number one! (looks around) Huh?
Cameron,Beautiful. (stands behind her) Isn't it?
Buffy,(still staring at the ocean) Yeah. It's just so...
Cameron,"Eternal. A true mother, giving birth to new life and devouring  old. (sits behind her) Always adaptable and nurturing... yet...  constant... and merciless."
Buffy,(looks at him) Boy. I was just gonna go with big and wet.
Cameron,"(laughs) Me and some of the other guys on the team, we come  out here once a week to train in it. See, we swim against the current."
Buffy,"Funny. That's how I feel most of the time. (turns to him) So,  Cameron Walker, you just won the state semifinals. What are you going to  do next?"
Cameron,I'm going to hang out with Buffy Summers. Get to know her.
Buffy,"(looks down for an instant) Hey, pause that tape for a second."
Cameron,Hey. No pressure. I just like being around you. That's all.
Jonathon,Somebody help me!
Dodd,"Come on, Jonny, you gotta hold your breath longer than that if  you ever wanna make the team! Hey, somebody time him!"
Dodd,Hey!
Buffy,"Nice tat. What, they ran out of Tweety bird?"
Dodd,"Hey, what's your problem?"
Cameron,"(chuckles) You had it coming to you, bro."
Gage,"Chill, dude. A bunch of us are gonna take a little night dip down  on the beach. You in?"
Dodd,Whatever.
Buffy,"Hey, let's, let's get you a towel."
Jonathon,(waves her off) No. Why don't you mind your own business? I  can handle this without your help. (leaves)
Buffy,(sighs) See? It's fun to hang out with me.
Dodd,"I can't believe Buffy. Man, that girl gives me the creeps."
Gage,Oh! Dude! What is that foulness?
Gage,"Hey, Dodd! (looks around the other way) Dude! (gives up) Huh."
Willow,"Okay! Good pie charts, everyone. (looks at another) Good.  (looks at another) All good."
Girl,Thanks.
Willow,(continues on) Nice. (walks around another) Good. (looks at  Gage's PC) Gage. Your pie chart is looking a lot like solitaire...  (looks closer) with naked ladies on the cards?
Gage,(looks up at her) What's your point?
Willow,No point.
Snyder,"Nice work in yesterday's meet, son. Now, let's go for it.  (pumps his fist)"
Willow,"Uh, hi there, sir."
Snyder,Rosenberg. How's the class? Everything in order?
Willow,"(worried) Well, actually..."
Snyder,(interrupts) Great. I've been talking to the board. We've been  having trouble finding a competent teacher this late in the term. Do you  think you could continue subbing through finals?
Willow,(smiles) Oh! Sure! I like teaching.
Snyder,"Isn't that nice. You're a team player, and I like that. A team  player wants everyone on the team to succeed. Wants everyone to pass."
Willow,"Well, yeah. Sure. (goes to her desk)"
Snyder,(follows her) I understand there's a problem with Gage  Petronzi.
Willow,"Oh, good, then you know. Well, yeah. Besides the behavior  problem, he won't do homework, and his test scores are..."
Willow,"Well, actually, he doesn't have any test scores because he  never shows up when we have..."
Snyder,"(turns to her and interrupts) I'm not interested in any of  that. I'm interested in why, when this school is on the brink of winning  its first state championship in fifteen years, you slap a crucial member  of that team with a failing mark that would force his removal. Is that  how you show your school spirit?"
Willow,"(flustered) Yes. Well, I mean... no. I'm just trying to grade  fairly."
Snyder,Gage is a champion. He's under more pressure than the other  students. And I think we need to cut him some slack.
Willow,You're asking me to change his grade? (faces him)
Snyder,"(stops and turns back) I never said any such thing. (steps over  to her) All I'm suggesting is... that you recheck your figures, and I  think we'll find a grade more fitting to an athlete of Gage's stature.  Perhaps something in a 'D'."
Xander,Just like that? He actually told you to alter his grade?
Willow,Exactly. Except for actually telling me to. But he made it  perfectly clear of what he wasn't telling me.
Xander,"That is wrong, a big, fat, spanking wrong. It's a slap in the  face to every one of us who studied hard and worked long hours to *earn*  our D's."
Cordelia,"Xander, I know you take pride in being the voice of the  common wuss, but the truth is, certain people are entitled to special  privileges. They're called winners. That's the way the world works."
Xander,And what about that nutty 'all men are created equal' thing?
Cordelia,Propaganda spouted out by the ugly and less deserving.
Xander,I think that was Lincoln.
Cordelia,(exhales) Disgusting mole and stupid hat.
Willow,"Actually, it was Jefferson."
Cordelia,Kept slaves. Remember?
Xander,You know what really grates my cheese? That Buffy's not here to  share my moral outrage about swim team perks.
Xander,She's too busy being one of them.
Cameron,"I don't know, a dolphin. A dolphin in the ocean. Because, you  know, when I'm in the vastness of the ocean, it's... (they pull to a  stop) it's like I'm never alone."
Cameron,You ever hear of a woman named Gertrude Ederle?
Buffy,"No. No, I can't say that I have, Cam."
Cameron,"First woman to swim the English Channel. (Buffy nods slowly,  bored) Same thing. I mean, she would talk to it. I mean, she'd carry on  entire conversations with it. Sometimes I do that. I mean, once I was  out in..."
Buffy,"(sits up) You know what, Cam? Thanks. I'd forgotten how nice it  is to just talk, or, in my case, listen, without any romantic pressure."
Cameron,Hey... I'm not about pressure. I just want you to be  comfortable.
Buffy,"(smiles) I'm comfy! I'm so comfy, I'm nodding off actually,  which is why..."
Cameron,(interrupts) Are you wearing a bra? (looks at her  suggestively)
Buffy,(in disbelief) What?
Cameron,"(grins) Come on. I mean, tell me you haven't been thinking  about this ever since last night."
Buffy,What I'm thinking about is that I should probably get out of  this car...
Cameron,Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.
Buffy,"Oh, it's not me I'm worried about."
Cameron,(snickers) You like it rough!
Cameron,Ow!
Cameron,Oh!
Cameron,Oh!
Cameron,Ah!
Cameron,"Oh, you broke my nose!"
Cameron,Ah!
Cameron,Ow!
Buffy,"I wasn't the attacker, Principal Snyder. I was the attacked."
Snyder,That's not how it looked from where I was standing.
Cameron,"I don't know what happened. I mean, first she leads me on,  then she goes schizo on me."
Buffy,(steps over to him) Lead you on? When did I lead you on?
Cameron,"Oh, come on. (to Snyder) I mean, look at the way she dresses."
Snyder,Coach.
Snyder,"(follows) Coach Marin, how bad does it look?"
Snyder,(leads the coach away from Cam) I mean our chances of winning  the state championship.
Snyder,Can we still do it?
Buffy,What happened to Dodd?
Snyder,That's none of your concern. You'd better hope that boy's nose  heals before the meet this Friday.
Buffy,"So I'm treated like the baddie just because he has a sprained  wrist and a bloody nose. (considers) And I don't have a scratch on me,  which, granted, hurts my case a little on the surface, but meanwhile he  gets away with it because he's on the 'aren't we the most' swim team..."
Buffy,"...who, by the way, if no one's noticed, have been acting like  real jerks lately..."
Buffy,"So, (giggles nervously) anything new with you guys? (sits)"
Giles,"Thank you for taking an interest. Apparently, some remains were  found on the beach this morning. Some human remains."
Willow,Dodd McAlvy's remains.
Buffy,Vampire?
Giles,"No. No, he was eviscerated. Nothing left but skin and cartilage."
Xander,"In other words, this was no boating accident."
Buffy,So something ripped him open and ate out his insides?
Willow,"Like an Oreo Cookie. (Xander shoots her a look) Well, except  for, you know, without the chocolatey *cookie* goodness."
Giles,"Yes. Um, Principal Snyder has, has asked the faculty to keep the  news quiet for now, um, so as not to unduly upset the students."
Xander,For 'students': read 'swim team'.
Willow,"So, we're looking for a beastie."
Giles,"That, uh, eats humans whole... except for the skin. (looks into  his book)"
Buffy,This doesn't make any sense.
Xander,Yeah. The skin's the best part.
Buffy,Any demons with high cholesterol?
Buffy,"(points at Giles) You're gonna think about that later, mister,  and you're gonna laugh."
Xander,Too much research. Need beverage.
Cameron,Hey! Watch it.
Xander,"Oh, forgive me, your Swim Teamliness."
Cameron,Loser.
Xander,"Likin' the nose, Cam. Good look for you. (stands back up)"
Cameron,Meaning what? (faces Xander)
Xander,"(steps over to Cam) Meaning Buffy must not be on your list of  privileges after all. (chuckles while Cam crosses his arms) Man, I love  it when you guys mess with her."
Cameron,(shakes his head) You're lucky I'm hungry.
Xander,"(in mock sympathy) Oh, the cafeteria's closed."
Cameron,Not to me. (leaves)
Cameron,"God, what is that?"
Xander,"Grape, orange. Orange, grape."
Xander,"Oh, my God."
Xander,"No, no, no! The mouth's a lot bigger! And downward. Like this."
Xander,With more teeth!
Cordelia,I'm doing the best I can.
Giles,"Is that what you saw, Xander?"
Xander,(picks up and looks at the sketch) Y... yeah! (considers) I  think so. (considers some more) Pretty much.
Giles,Aaaaare you sure?
Xander,"Well, it was dark! And the thing went through the window so  quick, and I was a... little shocked when I saw it, and..."
Cordelia,Go ahead. Say it. You ran like a woman. (grins)
Xander,"Hey, if you saw this thing, you'd run like a woman, too."
Willow,"Buffy was right. According to the statistics, Dodd and Cameron  were the best swimmers on the team. (hands Giles the figures)"
Buffy,"First and second, actually. Which means if my theory's correct,  Gage Petronzi, the third-best swimmer on the team, would be the next  item on the menu."
Cordelia,"God, this is so sad. We're never gonna win the state  championship. I think I've lost all will to cheerlead."
Xander,(goes to the counter) Raise your hand if you feel her pain.
Giles,"If you're saying these killings aren't random, it would suggest  someone's out for revenge."
Buffy,And raise the possibility that someone brought forth this sea  monster from whence it came to exact that revenge. (reconsiders her  words) 'From whence it came'? (Willow smiles) (to Giles) I'm spending  *way* too much time around you.
Xander,"Who would hate the swim team that much, though? (gets looks  from Buffy and Cordelia) Besides me, I mean."
Willow,(raises her hand) Ooo!
Buffy,Willow?
Willow,"Jonathon! He was bullied by Dodd the other day on the beach,  remember?"
Buffy,He did say he could take care of things himself. It's a good  call. You should question him.
Willow,(smiles) Really? Me? (menacingly) I'll crack him like an egg.
Giles,"Meanwhile, I think, uh, swimmer number three might benefit from  your... watchful eye and protection. Discreetly, of course."
Buffy,I'm on it. (leaves)
Xander,What about me? What can I do?
Cordelia,"Well, you could go out to the parking lot and practice  running like a man."
Willow,"So, Jonathon. (crosses her arms) You tried out for the swim  team twice and never made it?"
Jonathon,(fidgets) I'm asthmatic. I couldn't keep up.
Willow,"You resented it, didn't you?"
Jonathon,Maybe.
Willow,(approaches him) You hated being pushed around by Dodd and the  others.
Jonathon,So?
Willow,"(walks around to his other side) So, you wanted revenge. Didn't  you? (leans in suddenly) (sternly) Didn't you?!"
Jonathon,(nervously) Yeah! Okay? I did!
Willow,(smiles and straightens back up) So... You delved into the  black arts and conjured up a hellbeast from the ocean's depths to wreak  your vengeance.
Jonathon,Huh?
Willow,Didn't you?
Jonathon,(confused) What? No! I snuck in yesterday and... peed in the  pool.
Willow,(disappointed) Oh. (disgusted) Eww!
Snyder,"(quietly) It's a terrible, terrible tragedy. We all feel your  pain, coach. I don't know two finer boys than Cameron and... that other  one. (they stop) But I know they'd want their friends to go on and win  that state championship. It's time to think about the team."
Snyder,"You'll find someone. (they continue) All he has to do is wear a  bathing suit, right?"
Lyrics,"<I>If you'd listen, we wouldn't have to go through this</I>"
Lyrics,<I>If you'd just let me finish / Stop cuttin' and jumpin' ahead</I>
Lyrics,"<I>Yeah, if you'd just shut your pretty mouth / You'd save  yourself some tears</I>"
Lyrics,<I>You came back from the bathroom</I>
Lyrics,<I>With somethin' on your shoe</I>
Lyrics,"<I>Yeah, draggin' it behind you</I>"
Gage,This me-and-my-shadow act? It's getting old. What do you want  from me?
Lyrics,<I>Lookin' kinda foolish</I>
Buffy,"Well, um... (exhales nervously) It's a little embarrassing. You  see, I'm a swim groupie."
Gage,(unconvinced) Aha.
Buffy,"Oh, yeah. (smiles and exhales) You know, there's just something  about the smell of chlorine on a guy. Oh, baby."
Gage,(disbelieving) Hmm. (turns to go)
Buffy,"(runs around him) Uh, okay, okay, okay. (stops him) Obviously,  my sex appeal is on the fritz today, so I'll just give it to you  straight. There's something lurking out there, and it's making fillets  of the populace, and I think you might be next."
Gage,Uh-huh. And you think that because?
Buffy,"Well, it's already attacked. It's already killed some people."
Gage,"You're one twisted sister, you know that? Cam told me about your  games. Go find someone else to harass."
Gage,"What a psycho bitch, man."
Angelus,Gotta be talking about Buffy.
Gage,(stops and faces him) How'd you know?
Angelus,"Uh, she and I... had this thing once. Biggest mistake of my  life."
Gage,"Yeah. My condolences, dude. (turns and goes)"
Angelus,(follows) She's a real head-tripper.
Gage,Tell me about it. Girl acts like she's God's gift or something.
Angelus,Who is she? The Chosen One?
Gage,Exactly.
Angelus,"You know, what she really needs is for someone to really knock  her down off her notches."
Gage,"Yeah, that'd be sweet. Anyone in mind?"
Angelus,"You're in luck, my friend."
Angelus,Just so happens...
Angelus,...I'm recruiting.
Gage,No!
Gage,Ah! Somebody! Help! Ah! Help! Ah! Ah! Get him off me! Help! Ah!
Angelus,"Why, Miss Summers! You're beautiful!"
Gage,Oh. Was that the thing that killed Cameron?
Buffy,No. That was something else.
Gage,(confused) S-something else?
Buffy,"Yeah. Unfortunately, we have a lot of something elses in this  town. Good night. (goes)"
Gage,Hey!
Gage,(laughs nervously) Walk me home?
Cordelia,(to Buffy) So he spit it out? I thought Angel liked blood.
Buffy,He used to.
Willow,Maybe his eyes were too big for his stomach.
Buffy,"Or maybe there was something in Gage's blood that Angel didn't  like. Say, for example, steroids."
Willow,That would explain all their behavioral changes.
Cordelia,And their winning streak.
Willow,So maybe whatever's in their blood is what's attracting this  creature to them.
Buffy,Any luck researching our fish monster?
Cordelia,"Zippo. We couldn't find any sea demon that matched the  description that Xander gave us. Not that Chicken Little's much of a  witness, but..."
Cordelia,Oh.
Cordelia,"Oh! Oh, my! Now, that, girls, is my kind of..."
Willow,Xander? (stares in wide-eyed shock)
Cordelia,(shocked) Xander?!
Cordelia,What the hell are you doing here?
Xander,Shh! I'm undercover.
Buffy,Not under much. (grins)
Cordelia,Get out of here before someone sees you impersonating a  member of the swim team!
Xander,I don't do impersonations. I tried out for the team last night.  I made it.
Cordelia,(intrigued) Really?
Xander,Yeah. I figured I can keep an eye on Gage and the others when  Buffy can't.
Willow,(eyes wide) When you're nude? (gets a nudge from Buffy) I-I  meant to say 'changing'.
Xander,"Okey-dokey, coachie."
Cordelia,(smiles proudly) I'm dating a swimmer from the Sunnydale swim  team!
Buffy,You can die happy.
Buffy,(to Willow) What about Jonathon? Is he involved?
Willow,"Oh, no. He just... sort of... peed in the pool."
Buffy,Oh.
Buffy,(cringes) Oh!
Xander,"Don't you guys get claustrophobic in here? (sits) I mean,  what's the deal? You perspire a lot. You can't breathe. O-or read. I  mean, I guess you could, but the pages would probably get all wet."
Xander,You gotta love this undercover deal. Twenty minutes in a hot  room with a bunch of sweaty guys...
Buffy,Where's Gage?
Xander,"I don't know. He was right behind me, putting his sneakers on.  But it's not the Velcro kind, so give him a couple of extra minutes.  (taps her on the shoulder) Tag. You're it. (leaves)"
Gage,"OH, MY GOD!"
Gage,Help me! Help me! Ah! Help me!
Buffy,Gage?
Giles,(approaches Buffy) How are you?
Buffy,I'm definitely feeling the burn.
Giles,"(to Coach Marin) Well, the, uh, good news is that it would  appear that none of your team actually died."
Buffy,But the bad news is... they're monsters.
Giles,Are you saying you don't know?
Giles,You never asked any of the boys if they were taking anything?
Buffy,There.
Willow,"Dodd McAlvy: torn tendon. Gage Petronzi: fractured wrist,  depression, headaches."
Buffy,It's all there in the school medical records.
Willow,All symptomatic of steroid abuse.
Xander,"But is steroid abuse usually linked with, 'hey, I'm a fish'?"
Willow,"There must be something else in the mix. But the point is,  these boys were obviously drugged."
Buffy,And Nurse Greenleigh treated every one of them. She must have  known.
Willow,"If steroids are that dangerous, why would they do that to  themselves?"
Buffy,"They needed to win. And winning equals trophies, which equals  prestige for the school. You see how they're treated. It's been like  that forever."
Xander,Sure. The discus throwers got the best seats at all the  crucifixions.
Buffy,"Meanwhile, I'm breaking my nails every day battling the forces  of evil, and my French teacher can't even remember my name."
Xander,So what's the drill? Get Nurse Greenleigh?
Willow,(stands up) (sternly) Let's throw the book at her!
Buffy,"She probably went home for the day. I think it can wait. Xander,  why don't you see if you can find out what these boys are taking, or at  least how they're taking it? Powders, pills, syringe?"
Xander,I'm Lookin'-Around Guy.
Willow,What about you?
Buffy,Giles loaded up the tranquilizer gun. We're going fishing.
Xander,"I feel good! Lovin' the swimmin'. Had some carrot juice this  morning... A little wheat germ mixed in with it. Woke me right up.  Nothin' like it, huh? Breakfast of state champions. You betcha. Okay.  So... when do we get our next dose?"
Sean,What do you mean?
Xander,Who's carrying? I need a little something to improve my  performance. Give me an edge. Rrr! (chuckles)
Xander,The steroids. Where are they?
Sean,"(chuckles) You're soakin' in it, bud."
Xander,Huh?
Sean,(inhales deeply and exhales) Aromatherapy. It's in the steam.
Giles,They're absorbing the steroid mixture through the steam.
Xander,"(follows him) Not they. We. Me! We have to find an antidote,  don't you think? The clock is ticking, people!"
Buffy,"I wouldn't break out the tartar sauce just yet. I mean, it's not  like you were exposed more than once. (gets a worried look from Xander)  Twice?"
Xander,Three times a Fish Guy. (crosses his arms)
Cordelia,Whoa.
Xander,What am I gonna do?
Cordelia,"You, you, you. What about me? It's one thing to be dating the  lame unpopular guy, but it's another to be dating the creature from the  Blue Lagoon."
Xander,(paces over to her) Black Lagoon. The creature from the Blue  Lagoon was Brooke Shields. And thank you *so* much for your support!  (sits by her)
Buffy,(quietly to Giles and Willow) I think we'd better find the rest  of the swim team and lock them up before they get in touch with their  inner halibut.
Giles,"Yes. Yes, good. Uh, we also need to know exactly what's in this,  this steroid gas so that the hospital's toxicology lab can develop an  antidote."
Willow,"(stands up) Well, I'll talk to Nurse Greenleigh."
Buffy,You're really getting into this interrogation thing.
Willow,The trick is not to leave any marks. (leaves)
Buffy,"(gets up) On that note, I think I'm gonna go have a little talk  with our coach. Somehow, I doubt all he's been giving these boys is  inspiration. (leaves)"
Buffy,"Oh, well right now, I'm imagining you in jail. You're wearing a  big, orange suit, and, oh, look, the guards are beating you up."
Buffy,(stops following) (sternly) Tell me what's in the steam.
Buffy,And you did... sort of. Why?
Buffy,Do you understand that I don't care? It's over. There's not  gonna be any swim team.
Buffy,No. I was in the line for shred of sanity.
Buffy,Which you obviously skipped.
Buffy,This isn't over.
Buffy,"So, what, you're just gonna feed me to 'em?"
Cordelia,No one. Willow and Giles must've rounded up the rest of the  swim team.
Xander,Does my neck look scaly to you?
Cordelia,"Well, of course it looks scaly, the way you've been rubbing  it dry like an idiot."
Xander,I need to look in a mirror. Wait here. But feel free to come in  if you hear me scream.
Cordelia,Any gills yet?
Cordelia,"Xander, what are you doing? (giggles) Xander?"
Cordelia,"Oh, my God! Xander!"
Cordelia,"(very upset) It's me, Cordelia? I know you can't answer me,  but... God, this is all my fault. You joined the swim team to impress  me. You were so courageous. And you looked really hot in those Speedo's.  (chuckles) And I want you to know that I still care about you, no matter  what you look like. And... and we can still date. Or, or not. I mean...  I understand if you wanna see other fish. (crouches by the edge) I'll do  everything I can to make your quality of life better. Whether that means  little bath toys or whatever."
Xander,"Uh, Cordy?"
Xander,(points into the pool) That's not me.
Cordelia,"Oh, my God!"
Giles,I-in you go.
Giles,"Stay calm, chaps. (closed the door) Either we'll find an  effective antidote, or, or, uh... S-stay calm. (goes to Willow)"
Willow,Everyone's accounted for except Sean.
Cordelia,I think we can safely say we've found Sean. He was in the  pool skinless-dipping.
Xander,Where's Buffy?
Willow,She hasn't come back yet.
Buffy,Great. This is just what my reputation needs: that I did it with  the entire swim team.
Xander,"What's up, coach?"
Xander,Little dry. Nothing a lemon butter sauce won't cure.
Xander,Where's Buffy?
Xander,"Buffy, hurry! Your hand!"
Xander,Hold on!
Buffy,Pull!
Xander,Hold on!
Buffy,Thanks.
Xander,Just doin' my part for our team.
Buffy,Oh!
Buffy,(reaches down) Grab my hand!
Buffy,Those boys really love their coach.
Xander,Let's see. I gotta take a make-up chem test at three. And then  I'm meetin' some of the guys for plasma transfusions at five. It's  turned into quite the busy afternoon.
Buffy,"The fun never stops with you, does it?"
Willow,Giles seems pretty confident that the treatments are gonna  work.
Xander,"Well, turning into a creepy-crawly wasn't on my top ten list of  things to do before I turn twenty."
Cordelia,(to Xander) I want you to know that you've really proven  yourself to me. And you don't have to join the new team next year if you  don't want. I'd be just as happy if you played football. (smiles)
Giles,"The... people from animal control have just left. Our creatures  have apparently made a, a dash for it. Um... so to speak."
Willow,Does that mean we're gonna have to hunt them again?
Buffy,"No, I don't think so. I don't think we'll be seeing them  anymore."
Giles,Where do you think they'll go?
Buffy,Home.
