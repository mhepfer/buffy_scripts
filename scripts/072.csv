Mayor,Open the box. Scene of Faith opening box.
Mayor,Surprise. Scene of Buffy and Faith's hands are clasped and glowing.
Joyce,"What's gonna happen to her? Plainclothes officer: Well, get her checked out. She's in stable condition, she goes to jail, pending trial. Joyce: I just hope she gets some kind of help. [Rattling.] Plainclothes officer: The first thing is to keep her from hurting anybody else."
Faith,No.
Joyce,"Oh, uh, of course."
Buffy,She's not a kid!  I just mean that she's very strong.
Buffy,She truly is.
Joyce,Faith.
Joyce,"Why do you think she's like that? Buffy [shrugs]: You know.  She's a nut job.  Heh. Joyce: I just don't understand what could drive a person to that kind of behavior. Buffy: Well, how do you know she got drove? I mean, maybe she likes being that way. Joyce: I'll never believe that. I think she's horribly unhappy. Buffy: Well, could be things are looking up. I mean, a little stint in the pokey, show her the error of her ways. I'm sure there's some big old Bertha just waiting to shower her ripe little self with affection. Joyce: Buffy! Buffy: I'm sorry, mom. [Sighs] It's just ufff when I think about how she might have hurt you, I just, uff I can't stand it."
Joyce,"Sorry. Buffy: No, I'm just, uff, sore from the fight. Joyce: I've missed you. Buffy: Cause I haven't visited, right? I knew it. Joyce: I know how it is. You have so much in your life now. Buffy: I'm a busy little beaver. College and all. Joyce: Of course. But um, maybe we could spend some time together soon? Some...   night when I'm not being held hostage by a raving psychotic. Buffy: Count on it. [Pause] I'm gonna take a bath."
Buffy,"Why, yes, I would be Buffy. May I help you? Buffy [sounding]: Buffy. [She sticks out her tongue again. She adjusts her hair.]"
Buffy,[louder] Because it's wrong. [She tilts head.] Buffy: [softly] Because it's wrong.
Faith,Let me go! Let me go!
Doctor,Get me a sedative now! Officer: Hold her!
Faith,I have to go home! She's with my mother. [Doctor puts needle to Faith's arm.] Faith: No! Doctor: Just lie still. Faith: You don't understand. Officer: Keep holding her. Faith: She's taken my...my body. [Faith loses consciousness.]
Tara,"I do. Willow: [sighs] I should check in with Giles, get a situation update. [She gets up and walks behind Tara.] Tara: I am, you know. Willow: What? [Tara turns and looks up at Willow.] Tara: Yours. [Willow smiles.]"
Joyce,Is that the Harlot? Buffy: Yeah. Joyce: That's the same one Faith picked. Buffy: Burn it. [Buffy tosses it to Joyce who catches it.]
Weatherby,"By order of the Watcher's Council, you are being taken into custody until such time-- [They both drag her to the back of the armored truck.] Collins: Skip the speech. [They pull her in the truck.] Collins: Let's go. [The doors close.]"
Giles,"It's about Faith, not surprisingly. Buffy: Didn't Joyce tell you?  I already kicked that ass. Xander: I feel a high five coming on. Willow: Where is she? Buffy: On her way to the big house. Cops took her off my  hands about an hour ago. Poetic justice."
Anya,"How's that? Buffy: Well, she did all those crimes, and now she's being arrested. [Silence.] I guess that's just regular justice. [Willow smiles.]  It's cool, anyway."
Giles,"Unless I'm mistaken, Faith is no longer in police custody. Buffy [stands]: What are you talking about? Giles: Watcher's Council. They uh sent a retrieval team to capture Faith. Buffy: Well, yeah, I mean, 'cause it worked so well when Wesley tried it. Giles: This is a special operations unit.  They, uh, handle the council's trickier jobs - smuggling, interrogation, wetworks. Willow: What's wetworks? Xander: Scuba-type stuff. Anya: I thought it was murder. Xander: Well, yeah, but there could be underwater murder, with snorkels. Buffy: So they're taking her to England? Giles: It'll be a long, long time before she returns. Buffy: Heh heh heh. ahhh Hah hah.  Hah hah. ohhh I'm sorry. It's just...I'm happy. Faith is evil."
Willow,"Yeah. I hope they throw the book at her. Giles: I'm not sure there is a, a book for this. Willow: They could throw other things. Buffy: I forgot how much you don't like Faith. Willow: After what she's done to you? Oh, I wish those council guys would let me have an hour alone in the room with her, if I was larger and had grenades."
Buffy,I bet I know what Faith would say to that.
Anya,"So what you're saying is that everything's fine? Giles: Oh, um, yes. Anya: Well, I'm glad you called us all here because that information could never be conveyed by telephone. Willow [to Buffy]: What's up? Giles: Well, I just thought it was, uh, best to convene, in case there were any loose ends Buffy [to Willow]: I'd never let her hurt you. Giles: or things that we  might have forgotten. Willow [to Buffy]: I know. Giles: But if you're, uh, keen to go, then, please, by all means, go. Xander: We kind of have a romantic evening planned. Anya: We were gonna light a bunch of candles and have sex near them. Buffy: Well, we certainly don't want to cut into that seven minutes. Anya: Hey. Xander: I believe that's my hey. Hey! Buffy: Lighten up. We're out of danger. Everything's good. Giles: We still have Adam to take care of. Buffy: Yeah. Adam. What's up with him? Giles: I wish we knew. Buffy: Well, don't worry about it. I'll patrol tonight, as long as it takes. You guys have your fun, I'll be out there doing my job."
Buffy,"Whoop. Spike: Oh, you. Buffy: And you. Spike: What, are you keeping tabs on me? You're gonna give me a hard time now? Buffy: Um, do I usually give you a hard time? Spike: Very funny.  Well, you don't have to worry about me drinking. Unless you're here to protect innocent beers. [He holds up a bottle.] [Spike walks away a little and Buffy follows.] Buffy: You're a vampire. Spike: Was. And as soon as I get this chip out of my head, I'll be a vampire again. But until then, I'm just as helpless as a kitten up a tree.  So why don't you sod off? Buffy: Ok. Spike [angry]: Oh, fine! Throw it in my face! Spike's not a threat  anymore.  I'll turn my back. He can't hurt me."
Buffy,Spike?  [Gets it.]  Spike.  William the Bloody with a chip in  his head. I kind of love this town.
Spike,"You know why I really hate you, Summers? Buffy: 'Cause I'm a stuck-up tight-ass with no sense of fun? Spike: Well, yeah, that covers a lot of it. Buffy: Cause I could do anything I want, and instead, I choose to pout and whine and feel the burden of slayerness? I mean, I could be rich, I could be famous, I could have anything.  Anyone. [Buffy moves closer and puts her hands on Spike's chest.] Even you, Spike.  I could ride you at a gallop until your legs  buckled and your eyes rolled up.  I've got muscles you've never  even dreamed of.  I could squeeze you until you popped like warm  champagne, and you'd beg me to hurt you just a little bit more. And you know why I don't? [She moves closer and looks up at him pursing her lips.] Because it's wrong. Humh humh.  [She moves off.]"
Spike,"I get this chip out, you and me are gonna have a confrontation. Buffy: Count on it. [Spike throws his bottle into the wall and walks off.  He shoves someone and clutches his head.]"
Vampire,"It was too crowded. We gotta hold out for a few hours,  pick up a straggler, some drunk. Can't be calling attention to [He sees Adam and stops.] ourselves."
Adam,"I've been thinking.  About vampires. Vampire: This is my place. Adam:  You're place.  Yes.  The sewers. You hide from them, Crawl about in their filth. Scavenging like rats. What do you fear?"
Vampire,"Kill this guy already. [One vampire charges Adam and Adam grabs it by the throat and holds it.] Adam: You fear the cross. The sun. Fire. And, oh, yes... [Adams puts his other hand on the vampire's shoulder and he lifts the  vampire's head from its shoulders.  The body falls and he drops the head on it and they turn to dust.]"
Adam,"I believe decapitation is a problem as well. Vampire: You can have the place. I mean, we don't have to stay here anymore.  Adam: You fear death.  Being immortal, you fear it more than those  to whom it comes naturally.  Vampires are a paradox."
Vampire,"Ok, we're a paradox.  That's cool. Adam: Demon in a human body. You walk in both worlds and belong to neither.  I can relate.  Come.  We have a lot to talk about."
Weatherby,"Well, it's awake. Faith: Who are you? Weatherby: Council. We're taking you back to the mother country. Seems you've been a naughty girl."
Faith,"Listen to me.  Y-You've made a mistake.  I am not Faith.  I'm Buffy Summers. Faith performed some kind of spell, she switched our bodies."
Faith,"You have to find Faith.  C-call Giles. J-just get him here. Collins: Giles doesn't work for the council anymore. For that matter, neither does Buffy Summers. And what you are, miss, is a package. I deliver the package. I don't much care what's inside. [To Weatherby.] Come on."
Weatherby,"He may not care, but I do. The Watcher's Council used to mean something.  You perverted it. You trash. We should have killed you while you were asleep."
Willow,"I can't believe you've never been here.  The Bronze is the coolest place in Sunnydale. Of-of course, there's not a lot of competition. I think the vending machine at Bergen's came in second."
Tara,"Y-you used to come here a lot? Others: Chug chug chug Willow: I lived here. Me, Xander..."
Buffy,"oooh ooooh Others: Chug, chug, chug!"
Others,"Woo hoo hoo. Willow: Wow. I-I didn't think she'd be here. Come on, [holds Tara's hand] I want you to meet her."
Buffy,Back off. [Pushes someone away.]  You're nothing but a  disappointment.
Willow,"Tara was in my wicca group. Buffy: Unh-huh. [Buffy walks away and they follow.] Willow: So, what's up?  [Buffy plops herself on a couch.]  Patrol a no go? [Buffy throws her legs up in the air and on a table.]"
Buffy,"Got tired. You know, the whole Faith thing. I let off some steam. Willow: Good for you. You shouldn't work yourself too hard. Buffy: That's my philosophy.  [Buffy throws her arms behind her head.] Willow: Anyone want a soda? Tara [looks at Willow]: Water. [Buffy shakes head.  Willow walks off and Buffy notes Tara looking back at Willow.  She sits up and leans forward.] Buffy: So you guys been hanging out a lot lately, hunh? Tara: Yeah. she's, um, she's really cool. [Buffy nods and blinks slowly.] Buffy [grins]: So Willow's not driving stick anymore. Who would have thought? I guess you never really know someone until you've been inside their sking. And Oz is out of the picture?  Oh, never seen two people so much in love. She just couldn't get enough of old Oz."
Tara,"She, um, said he, uh, uh, w-w-w-w-w-went Buffy: He w-w-w-w-what? You gonna get that sentence out sometime tonight? [Tara lowers her head.]"
Willow,"Everything poofed? Buffy: All's well in the world. Willow: Tara's not feeling well. I'm gonna walk her home.  [Willow looks back at Tara.] Buffy: Yeah. You give her whatever she needs.  [Buffy smiles for a second.] Willow: Are you gonna be in later, or you going over to Riley's? [Buffy blinks several times and then smiles.]"
Smith,"This'll bloody keep you quiet.  [Smith opens the back of the truck and goes in. Faith grabs him and gets him in a chokehold with the chains.] Smith: Uh. Faith: How about this? I'll be quiet, and you can scream. Smith: Aaahh. [Weatherby and Collins look in from the back of the truck.] Faith: Now you unchain me - very slowly And! politely, or I kill this guy"
Collins,"When we go on a job, we always put our affairs in order first, in case of accident."
Smith,Collins...
Collins,"Sorry, Smithy.  [They walk off.]"
Collins,"She's starting to bother me. Weatherby: Getting her across the border is gonna be a lot more trouble than it's worth. Collins: If the council can even get us passage. I'll call them. It's time for a contingency plan. [Smith flies out the back of the truck and falls, groaning.]"
Willow,I'm sorry you're feeling all blechy.  But we'll get together with Buffy another time.  Sometime soon. I think you'll really like her.
Willow,So you think Buffy's not herself? Like she's been possessed or something?
Tara,"[sigh] I'm not sure.  Willow: You didn't sense a hyena energy at all, did you? Because hyena possession is just...unpleasant."
Tara,"[umph] Do you have anything of hers? Willow: Of Buffy's?  Uhhhh. Oh! This ring. Tara:  I-I think there's a way we can, hmm... [reaches for book] The passage to the nether realm. There-there's a ritual. If you can find Buffy there, you should be able to see."
Willow,"If it'll help her. [Tara sighs.] Willow: What? Tara: Well, the nether realm exists beyond the physical world. Accessing it is...  I-it-it's kind of like astral projection. It's very intense. I'd have to be your anchor, keep you on this plane."
Buffy,"You miss me? Riley: I did, actually.  Everything's ok? Buffy: Everything's great. [walks forward] Riley: What about Faith? Buffy: Faith has a won a fabulous trip to England, and I  [sits on Riley's lap, straddling him] got the consolation prize,  which is you."
Riley,"So I don't have to worry about Faith showing up? Though I have to admit, I was kind of curious to meet her."
Buffy,"You're hurt. [He closes the door.] Riley: Ahh, um, not that bad, actually.  I guess the, uh, drugs the professor gave me really did make me stronger. I'm healing pretty quick."
Buffy,Maybe we should take you for a test drive. Riley: I wouldn't say no. [He walks forward.] Buffy: So...how do you want me?  [She crawls on the bed looking away from Riley and turns around.] Riley: How do I? Buffy: Yeah. what do you wanna do with this body? What nasty little desire have you been itching to try out? Am I a bad girl? Do you wanna hurt me?
Adam,I have a gift no man has.  [That] No demon has ever had.  I know why I'm here.  I was created to kill.  To extinguish life  wherever I find it.  And I have accepted that responsibility. You have lived in fear and desperation because you didn't have  that gift.  But it's time to face your fear.
Adam,"Then ask yourself, what is it? More than man, more than  anything else. What is the thing you fear?"
Buffy,You've got a mission? I've been fighting demons since  before you could shave.
Forrest,"Yeah, you're a killer. Buffy: I am not a killer!!! I am the slayer!. And you don't know the first thing about me."
Forrest,"You really care what I think? Buffy: No. I don't care. [Throws hands up.] God, I don't care. [She leaves and the door closes.]"
Collins,They can't get us passage. They've ordered the kill. [He screws a silencer onto a pistol.] Weatherby: Torch the place? Collins:  Get the gas. [Weatherby walks off.] Smith: She could've killed me.  She didn't. Collins:  Lucky you.
Faith,"Ok, I'm good at this. [She shifts gears.] Faith: Ooh, drive. [Smith has found a gun and shoots at the truck but Faith drives the armored truck out through the wooden wall/door, breaking it.}"
Faith,"Giles! Giles: God! Faith: Don't move. Ok, Giles, you have to listen to me very carefully. I'm not Faith."
Giles,"Really? Faith: Really. Giles: Cause the resemblance is striking. Faith: I know. Giles, you just have to... Stop inching. you were  inching."
Giles,"Look, I-I know what you're going to say, and-and uh Faith: I'm Buffy. Giles: All right, I didn't know what you were going to say, but that doesn't make you any less crazy."
Faith,"Faith switched. I mean, she had some device.  She switched  our bodies.  Giles, I swear [runs hand through hair] it's me."
Giles,"U-um, if-if you are Buffy, then, [sets plate & cups down] uh, then you'll let me tie you up w-without killing me - until we find out whether you're telling the truth."
Faith,"Giles, Faith has taken my body, and for all I know, she's taken it to Mexico by now. I-I don't have time for  bondage fun. Ask me a question. Ask me anything."
Giles,"Who's president? Faith: We're checking for Buffy, not a concussion. Giles: Oh, yes, Alright. um... Faith: Umph, Giles, you turned into a demon, and I knew it was you. I mean can't you just look in my eyes and be all intuitive?"
Giles,"How did I turn into a demon? Faith: Oh, cause, uh, Ethan Rayne. And-and you have a girlfriend  named Olivia, and you haven't had a job since we blew up the school, which is valid lifestyle wise. I mean, it's not like you're a slacker type, but... Oh, oh! when I had psychic power, I heard my mom think that you were  like a stevedore during sex. What? Do you want me to continue?"
Giles,"Actually, I beg you to stop. Faith: What's a stevedore? Giles: Alright, let's-- um, I need you to explain everything. Faith: And I will, after we get Faith. [Willow and Tara enter.] Willow: Giles! Faith: Will. Willow: Oh, my god. Faith: Willow, wait. you don't understand. Willow: You're Buffy. You and Faith switched bodies, probably  through a Draconian Katra spell."
Faith,"Oh, thank God. [telephone rings] Giles: I'll get it. Giles: Hello. Faith: Do you know where Faith is? Giles: Oh yes, uh, Buffy's here with uh, me. Actually, she--she's uh  Oh, all right."
Giles,"Xander. Apparently there's a report on the television. [Giles turns on the tv.] News announcer: ...and barricaded themselves in the church with at least 20 parishioners. One of the few who escaped described the three men as frighteningly disfigured, almost inhuman. So far, one escapee has since died of severe neck wounds. [Cut to airport.] [Buffy sees the report on another tv.] News announcer: There is no report on the condition of the  parishioners still trapped inside, but their assailants have vowed to kill all of them [Buffy looks down, then back up at the screen]  if police attempt to storm the church."
Vampire,"It's hard to believe. I've been avoiding this place for so  many years, and it's nothing. It's nice! It's got the pretty windows, The pillars...  lots of folks to eat. Where's the thing I was so afraid of? You know, the Lord?  He was supposed to be here. He gave us this address.  Well, we'll just have to start killing off His people, see if He shows up."
Riley,What'd he say? Policeman: He said I should defer command to you. Riley: Then you hold your men until the reserves arrive. This is a military situation.
Policeman,"What, they got bombs in there? Riley: Your men are not prepared to deal with them. Just trust me. [Siren.  Riley walks nearer the church. He sees...] Riley: Buffy. Buffy: How many are in there? Riley: We think there's three. Buffy: I can do three.  [Riley tugs at her arm.] Riley: Not alone. Look wait for the troops to get here. They're still mobilizing."
Buffy,"How did you respond so fast? Riley: I didn't. I was just late for church. [Buffy shakes her head.] Buffy: Look, when the troops get here, send 'em in, but I'm going. Riley: I don't want you risking--   [Riley tugs at her arm.] Buffy: Don't tell me what to do! I'm Buffy. I have to do this.   Riley: Then I'm coming with. [Buffy pokes Riley near which he is hurt.] Riley: Ow! Buffy: I can't use you.  someone comes out, you get 'em to safety. Unless they've got fangs."
Vampire,"I told the cops, they send any one in, I start the whole massacre thing."
Buffy,"Well, I'm not the cops.  I just come to pray. Vampire: now's a good time to start. Buffy: You're *not* gonna kill these people. Vampire: Why not? Buffy: Because it's wrong. [Vampire 3 attacks from behind and is thrown up in the air He collides with a column  and he doesn't get up.]"
Vampire,You're the slayer.
Buffy,The one and only.
Vampire,You think we're afraid of you? We're not afraid Of anything anymore.
Buffy,"Then let all these people go, and all three of you can take me on."
Vampire,Heh. I got a better idea.
Riley,You forgot your coat.
Riley,"I don't understand. how could she have... ummph I mean, how's it possible?"

Buffy and all copyrighted characters are the product of Joss Whedon and I have nothing but respect for him and those whose hard work is put into bringing us a great show.  I did this of my own free time and will never make a dime from it."
Detective,It's good you called.  We've been looking for this girl since she broke out of the hospital.
Joyce,What's going to happen to her?
Detective,"Well, get her checked out.  If she's in stable condition, she goes to jail, pending trial."
Joyce,I just hope she gets some kind of help.
Detective,The first thing is to keep her from hurting anybody else.
Detective,"Well, you guys will be safe now.  We may have a couple of questions in the morning."
Joyce,"Oh, uh, of course."
Detective,Thank you both.  I'm glad we finally got the kid.
Faith,(sharply) She's not a kid. (sees the detective's surprised look) I just mean that she's very strong.
Detective,Yeah.  This Faith chick-- definitely dangerous.
Faith,She truly is.
Joyce,Faith.
Joyce,Why do you think she's like that?
Faith,"(offhandedly) Well, you know.  She's a nut job.  Heh."
Joyce,I just don't understand what could drive a person to that kind of behavior.
Faith,"Well, how do you know she got drove?  I mean, maybe she likes being that way."
Joyce,I'll never believe that.  I think she's horribly unhappy.
Faith,"Well, could be things are looking up.  I mean, a little stint in the pokey, show her the error of her ways. (slight grin) I'm sure there's some big old Bertha just waiting to shower her ripe little self with affection."
Joyce,(shocked) Buffy!
Faith,"(oops) I'm sorry, Mom.  It's just . . . (crosses the room to Joyce playing concerned daughter) when I think about how she might have hurt you, I just . . . I can't stand it."
Joyce,(slightly hurt) Sorry.
Faith,"(makes of show of stretching her shoulders) No, I'm just, uh, sore from the fight."
Joyce,I've missed you.
Faith,"'Cause I haven't visited, right? (smug) I knew it."
Joyce,I know how it is.  You've . . . got so much in your life now.
Faith,I'm a busy little beaver.  College and all.
Joyce,"(nods) Of course. (hopefully) But, um, maybe we could spend some time together soon?  Some night when I'm not being held hostage by a raving psychotic."
Faith,(pause) Count on it. (smiles) I'm gonna take a bath.
Faith,"Why, yes, I would be Buffy.  May I help you?"
Faith,(practicing) Buf-fy.
Faith,(scolding) You can't do that!  It's wrong.
Faith,"(sensitive) You can't do that, because it's naughty. (grimaces)"
Faith,(stern) Because it's wrong.
Faith,(empathy) Because it's wrong.
Faith,(bad-ass tone) You can't do that!  It's wrong!  I'll kick your ass!
Faith,I'm gonna kill you!
Doctor,"Get me a sedative, NOW!"
Detective,Hold her!
Buffy,(yelling) I have to go home!  She's with my mother!
Buffy,NO!
Doctor,Just lie still.
Buffy,(weakening voice) You don't understand.
Detective,Keep holding her.
Buffy,(fading) She's taken my-- my body.
Willow,I wonder where she is?
Tara,Who?  Faith?
Willow,Yeah.  I wish she would make a move.  She's making my stomach all acidy.
Tara,But you think Buffy can handle her?
Willow,I think so. (worried) But that doesn't mean Faith won't hurt someone else.
Tara,"Well, you should be safe.  Nobody knows you're here.  I mean . . . they don't even know I exist, right?  I know all about them, but . . ."
Willow,Hey.
Tara,"I mean, I mean, th-that's totally cool.  I mean, it-it's good. It's . . . it's better."
Willow,"Tara, it's not like I don't want my friends to know you.  It's just . . . well, Buffy's like my best friend, and she's really special.  And . . there's this whole bunch of us, and-and we sort of have this group thing that revolves around the slaying, and-and I-I really want you to meet them.  But I-I just kinda like having something that's just, you know . . . mine."
Willow,"And I-I usually don't use so many words to say stuff that little, but (laughs softly) do you get it at all?"
Tara,I do.
Willow,"I should check in with Giles, get a situation update."
Tara,"I am, you know."
Willow,What?
Tara,(meaningfully) Yours.
Faith,Not too bad.
Faith,Score.
Faith,". . . 6-4-4-7.  Uh, expiration, 5-0-1.  (slips the card back into the wallet glancing at the door to make sure the coast is clear) Uh-huh.  Yeah. (she pulls out a small bundle of dollar bills and stuffs them into her bra) Ten AM's your earliest flight?  I'll take it."
Joyce,What are you doing?
Faith,"Oh, just (grabs the stack of envelopes beside her) . . . getting my mail."
Joyce,"Oh.  Um, that was, um, Giles on the other line.  He wanted you to meet your friends there.  Said he had news."
Faith,"Yeah.  I got some time to kill. (swinging her legs off the bed she walks over to the vanity table) I'll go see the gang.  All my friends. (snatches up a lipstick resting on it) You don't mind if I steal this, right?"
Joyce,Is that the Harlot?
Faith,(looks at it) Yeah.
Joyce,That's the same one Faith picked.
Faith,(tossing her the lipstick) Burn it.
Detective,"(glancing back at her) She's coming to.  Man, I want this kid's constitution."
Buffy,(dazed) Faith.
Detective,Let's move it.  I want to get her in before she's a hundred percent.
Weatherby,"By order of the Watcher's Council, you are being taken into custody until such time--"
Collins,Skip the speech.
Collins,Let's go.
Giles,"Ah, Buffy.  Good."
Faith,"The Scooby gang's all here.  Willow, Xander, and (sees Anya standing close to Xander) . . .  everybody.  What's up?"
Giles,"It's about Faith, not surprisingly."
Faith,Didn't Joyce tell you?  I already kicked that ass. (slaps her fist into her palm)
Xander,I feel a high-five coming on.
Willow,Where is she?
Faith,(grinning) On her way to the big house.  Cops took her off my hands about an hour ago.  Poetic justice.
Anya,How's that?
Faith,"Well . . . she did all those crimes and now she's being arrested. (frowns) I guess that's just regular justice.  It's cool, anyway."
Giles,"(stepping out of the kitchen) Unless I'm mistaken, Faith is no longer in police custody."
Faith,(hops off the desk) What are you talking about?
Giles,"The Watcher's Council.  They, uh, sent a retrieval team to capture Faith."
Faith,"(sarcastic) Well, yeah.  I mean, cause it worked so well when Wesley tried it. (leans on the desk)"
Giles,"This is a special operations unit.  They, uh, handle the council's trickier jobs: smuggling, interrogation, uh, wetworks."
Willow,What's wetworks?
Xander,Scuba-type stuff.
Anya,I thought it was murder?
Xander,"Well, yeah. (lamely) But there could be underwater murder, with snorkels."
Faith,So they're taking her to England?
Giles,"It'll be a long, long time before she returns."
Faith,(trying to stop) Sorry.  It's just . . . I'm happy.  Faith is evil.
Willow,(disdainful) Yeah.  I hope they throw the book at her.
Giles,I'm not sure there is a-a book for this.
Willow,(innocently) They could throw other things.
Faith,(to Willow) I forgot how much you don't like Faith.
Willow,"After what she's done to you?  Oh, I wish those council guys would let me have an hour alone in the room with her.  (a beat) If I was larger and had grenades."
Faith,(scornful) I bet I know what Faith would say to that.
Anya,(OS: to Giles) So what you're saying is that everything's fine?
Giles,"(OS) Oh, um . . . yes."
Anya,"(OS) Well, I'm glad you called us all here, because that information can never be conveyed by telephone."
Willow,(concerned) What's up?
Giles,"(OS) Well, I just thought it was, uh, best to convene, in case there were any loose ends--"
Faith,I'd never let her hurt you.
Giles,(OS) . . . or things that we might have forgotten.
Willow,(smiles trustingly) I know.
Giles,"(OS) But if you're, uh, keen to go, then, please, by all means. Go."
Xander,(hugging Anya) We kinda have a romantic evening planned.
Anya,(smiling) We were gonna light a bunch of candles and have sex near them. (a flash of discomfort crosses Xander's face)
Faith,"(knowingly) Well, we certainly don't want to cut into that seven minutes."
Anya,(hurt) Hey.
Xander,I believe that's my hey. (to Faith) Hey!
Faith,(grinning) Lighten up.  We're out of danger. (turns and walks towards the door) Everything's good.
Giles,We still have Adam to take care of.
Faith,(huh?) Yeah. (faces them) Adam. (casually) What's up with him?
Giles,I wish we knew.
Faith,"Well, don't worry about it.  I'll patrol tonight.  As long as it takes.  You guys have your fun.  I'll be out there doing my job."
Faith,Ooo!
Spike,"(bugger it sigh) Oh, *you*."
Faith,(a beat) And you.
Spike,What?  Are you keeping tabs on me?  You're gonna give me a hard time now?
Faith,"(blinks questioningly) Um, do I usually give you a hard time?"
Spike,"(not amused) Very funny.  Well, you don't have to worry about me drinking. (raises his beer bottle) Unless you're here to protect innocent beers."
Faith,You're a vampire.
Spike,"(glaring) Was.  And as soon as I get this chip out of my head, I'll be a vampire again. But until then, I'm just as helpless as a kitten up a tree.  So why don't you sod off?"
Faith,(nonchalantly) Okay. (starts walking away)
Spike,"(pissed) Oh, fine!  Throw it in my face! (she faces him again) Spike's not a threat anymore, I'll turn my back!  He can't hurt me."
Faith,"Spike? (recognition) Spike. (she starts to smile as she steps closer to him, until she's standing right in front of him) William the Bloody with a chip in his head.  I kind of love this town."
Spike,"(scoffs) You know why I really hate you, Summers?"
Faith,(cheerfully) Cause I'm a stuck-up tight-ass with no sense of fun?
Spike,"Well-- (falters) . . . Yeah, that covers a lot of it."
Faith,"Cause I could do anything I want, and instead I choose to pout and whine and feel the burden of Slayerness? (shrugs) I mean, I could be rich.  I could be famous.  I could have anything. (a beat) Anyone."
Faith,"Even you, Spike. (voice taking on a sultry tone) I could ride you at a gallop until your legs buckled and your eyes rolled up.  I've got muscles you've never even dreamed of.  I could squeeze you until you pop like warm champagne and you'd beg me to hurt you just a little bit more.  And you know why I don't?"
Faith,Because it's wrong. (chuckles)
Spike,(menacingly) I get this chip out . . . you and me are gonna have a confrontation.
Faith,(just as menacingly) Count on it.
Boone,"It's too crowded.  We gotta hold out for a few hours, pick up a straggler.  Some drunk.  Can't be calling attention to (they stop when they see something in the cave) . . . ourselves."
ADAM,I've been thinking.  About vampires.
Boone,(threateningly) This is my place.
ADAM,"(unintimidated) You're place, yes.  The sewers.  You hide from them.  Crawl about in their filth.  Scavenging like rats.  What do you fear?"
Boone,Kill this guy already.
ADAM,"You fear the cross.  The sun.  Fire. (looks at his captive) And, oh, yes . . ."
ADAM,I believe decapitation is a problem as well.
Boone,"You can have the place.  I mean, we don't have to stay here anymore."
ADAM,"You fear death. (Adam walks closer to them) Being immortal, you fear it more than those to whom it comes naturally.  Vampires are a paradox."
Boone,(nervously) Okay.  We're a paradox.  That's cool.
ADAM,Demon in a human body.  You walk in both worlds and belong to neither.  I can relate.  Come.
ADAM,We have a lot to talk about.
Weatherby,"(callously) Well, it's awake."
Buffy,Who are you?
Weatherby,Council.  We're taking you back to the mother country. Seems you've been a naughty girl.
Buffy,Listen to me.  Y-you've made a mistake.  I am not Faith. (from the open rear doors she sees Collins step into view) I'm Buffy Summers.  Faith performed some kind of spell.  She switched our bodies.
Collins,(stoically) Congratulations.  No one's ever actually tried that one on me before.
Buffy,You have to find Faith.  Call Giles!  J-just get him here!
Collins,"Giles doesn't work for the council anymore.  For that matter, neither does Buffy Summers.  And what you are, miss, is the package. I deliver the package.  I don't much care what's inside. (to Weatherby) Come on."
Weatherby,"(angrily) He may not care, but I do.  The Watcher's Council used to mean something.  You perverted it.  You trash.  We should have killed you while you were asleep."
Willow,"(smiling) I can't believe you've never been here.  The Bronze is the coolest place in Sunnydale.  Of-of course, there's not a lot of competition.  I think the vending machine at Bergen's came in second."
Tara,Y-you used to come here a lot?
Willow,"We lived here.  Me, Xander-- (stops when she sees something)"
Group,"(OS) . . . chug, chug, chug . . ."
Willow,(surprised) Buffy?
Faith,"(with group) Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug-- ooh!"
Faith,Back off.  You're nothing but a disappointment.
Willow,"Hey, Buffy."
Faith,"Willow!  And, uh . . . (sees Tara)"
Willow,"Buffy, this is Tara."
Tara,(nervously) Hi.
Faith,So we've never met? (relieved) Cool.  Just . . . having a thing with names.
Willow,Tara was in my wicca group.
Faith,(not caring) Uh-huh.
Willow,"(following) So, what's up?  Patrol a no go?"
Faith,"Got tired.  You know, the whole Faith thing.  I let off some steam."
Willow,Good for you.  You shouldn't work yourself too hard.
Faith,(grinning) That's my philosophy.
Willow,Anyone want a soda?
Tara,Water.
Faith,"So you guys been hanging out a lot lately, huh?"
Tara,"(smiling) Yeah.  She's, um, she's really cool."
Faith,So Willow's not driving stick anymore. (Tara stops smiling) Who would have thought?  I guess you never really know someone until you've been inside their skin. (Tara's uncomfortable and lowers her head) And Oz is out of the picture?  Oh.  Never seen two people so much in love. (whispering) She just couldn't get enough of old Oz.
Tara,"She, um, said he, uh, uh, w-w-w-w-w-w--"
Faith,(cruelly) W-w-w-w-what?  You gonna get that sentence out sometime tonight?
Willow,"Buffy, guy in the corner."
Faith,Yeah.  Good call.
Tara,(lifts her head) What?
Willow,Vampire.
Faith,Wicked obvious. (sees Willow's expectant expression and realizes . . .) So I should slay him. (gets up)
Willow,You want help?
Faith,"Nah, I got it."
Faith,Hey!
Faith,(no big deal) You'll live.
Girl,(frightened) He was so strong!  I--
Faith,"(nonchalant) Yeah, well . . . he's gone now."
Girl,(gratefully) Thank you.  *Thank you.*
Faith,(unsure) Yeah.  It's cool.
Willow,Everything poofed?
Faith,All's well in the world.
Willow,Tara's not feeling well.  I'm gonna walk her home.
Faith,(knowingly) Yeah.  You give her whatever she needs.
Willow,"Are you gonna be in later, or are you going over to Riley's?"
Smith,(marching to the truck) This'll bloody keep you quiet.
Buffy,"How about this?  I'll be quiet, and you can scream."
Buffy,"Now, you unchain me, very slowly AND politely, or I kill this guy."
Collins,"When we go on a job, we always put our affairs in order first, in case of accident."
Smith,(choking) Collins...
Collins,"(unfeeling) Sorry, Smithy."
Collins,She's starting to bother me.
Weatherby,Getting her across the border is gonna be a lot more trouble than it's worth.
Collins,If the council can even get us passage.  I'll call them. It's time for a contingency plan.
Faith,"Hi, baby."
Willow,(closing the door) I'm sorry you're feeling all blechy.  But we'll get together with Buffy another time.  Sometime soon. (smiles) I think you'll really like her.
Tara,(faces her) She's not your friend.
Willow,(smile slips away) I may have overestimated the you liking her factor.
Tara,"No, no.  I mean, I don't (sighs) I don't think she's . . . her."
Willow,You lost me.
Tara,"Well, uh, a person's energy has a flow, a unity.  Buffy's was . . . was fragmented.  It-it grated, like something forced in where it doesn't belong.  Plus, she was, um, she was kind of mean."
Willow,So you think Buffy's not herself?  Like she's been possessed or something?
Tara,I'm not sure.
Willow,"You didn't sense a hyena energy at all, did you?  Because hyena possession is just . . . unpleasant."
Tara,Do you have anything of hers?
Willow,Of Buffy's?  Uh.  Oh. (indicates her right hand) This ring.
Tara,I-I think there's a way we can . . .
Tara,"The passage to the nether realm. There-there's a ritual.  If you can find Buffy there, you should be able to see."
Willow,If it'll help her.  (sees Tara's worried expression) What?
Tara,"Well, the nether realm exists beyond the physical world. Accessing it is . . . It-it's kind of like astral projection.  It's very intense.  I'd have to be your anchor.  Keep you on this plane."
Willow,I trust you.
Tara,It-it's not like anything that we've ever--
Willow,(smiling) I trust you.
Faith,You miss me?
Riley,"I did, actually.  Everything's okay?"
Faith,Everything's great.
Riley,What about Faith?
Faith,"(as she sits straddled across his lap) Faith has a won a fabulous trip to England, and I got the consolation prize, which is you."
Riley,"(as she caresses his chest) So I don't have to worry about Faith showing up?  Though I have to admit, I was kind of curious to meet her."
Riley,Or I was until about 30 seconds ago.
Faith,"(sits back up) Oh, you wouldn't have liked Faith.  She's not proper and joyless, like a girl should be.  She has a tendency to give in to her animal instincts."
Riley,Door's open.
Faith,So?
Riley,So my fantasies don't tend to include a bunch of marines staring in at me.
Faith,"Oh, maybe they could learn something."
Faith,You're hurt?
Riley,"(groans softly as he closes the door) I'm not that bad, actually.  I guess the, uh, drugs the professor gave me really did make me stronger.  I'm healing pretty quick."
Faith,(putting her hands on her hips) Maybe we should take you for a test drive.
Riley,(grinning) I wouldn't say no.
Faith,So. . . how do you want me?
Riley,(sitting on the edge) How do I . . . ?
Faith,Yeah.  What do you wanna do with this body?  What nasty little desire have you been itching to try out?  Am I a bad girl?  Do you wanna hurt me?
Riley,What are we playing at here?
Faith,I'm Buffy.
Riley,Okay.  Then I'll be Riley.
Faith,"(in a huff) Well, if you don't wanna play--"
Riley,Right.  I don't wanna play.
Both,". . . flows through the river in me.  The inward eye, the sightless sea . . . Ayala flows through the river in me. The inward eye, the sightless sea . . . Ayala flows through the river in me.  The inward eye, The sightless sea . . . Ayala flows through the river in me.  The inward eye, The sightless sea . . . Ayala flows through the river in me."
Riley,(softly) I love you.
Faith,(softly) Ugh.  Get off.  (breathing becoming claustrophobic) No.  No. (voice starts echoing in her head) No! Get-get off!  No!  Off me!  Get off!
Riley,Buffy?
Faith,No!  No!  Get--
Riley,(concerned) Buffy-- What?  What's wrong?
Faith,(anxious) Who are you?  What do you want from h-her?
Riley,(lowering his head) Should I not have. . ?
Faith,This is meaningless.
Riley,You're shaking.
Riley,(soothingly) Shhh-shh.
Riley,What happened?
Faith,(confused) Nothing. (relieved) Nothing.
ADAM,(pacing) I have a gift no man has.  No demon has ever had. (faces them) I know why I'm here.  I was created to kill.  To extinguish life wherever I find it.  And I have accepted that responsibility.  You have lived in fear and desperation because you didn't have that gift.  But it's time to face your fear.
Boone,(stands) Tell us what to do.
ADAM,(approaching) You are here to be my first.  To let them know that I am coming.
Boone,(sincerely) We're ready.
ADAM,"Then ask yourself, what is it?  More than man.  More than anything else.  What is the thing you fear?"
Forrest,Hope you left him alive.
Faith,What?
Forrest,Boy's supposed to be on the mend.  I don't see you letting him get much rest.
Faith,I think maybe you should stay out of other people's lives.
Forrest,We've got a mission here.  Back when Riley could still think for himself--
Faith,(bitterly) You've got a mission?  I've been fighting demons since before you could shave.
Forrest,"Yeah, you're a killer."
Faith,I am not a killer!  I am the Slayer!  And you don't know the first thing about me.
Forrest,(coldly) You really care what I think?
Faith,"No.  I don't care. (raises her hands in front of her) God, I don't care."
Collins,(equipping the silencer) They can't get us passage.  They've ordered the kill.
Weatherby,Torch the place?
Collins,Get the gas.
Smith,She could've killed me.  She didn't.
Collins,Lucky you.
Smith,(shouting) Weatherby!
Buffy,"(hurried) Keys, keys."
Weatherby,"Stop her, you ponce!"
Buffy,(turning on the engine) Okay.  I'm good at this.
Buffy,(wrestling with the gearshift) Ooo!  Drive.
Clerk,"(handing her the ticket) Okay, there you go."
Faith,Thank you.
Clerk,You're welcome.
Buffy,Giles!
Giles,(startled) Gaah!
Buffy,"(cautiously) Don't move.  Okay.  Giles, y-you have to listen to me very carefully.  I'm not Faith."
Giles,Really?
Buffy,Really.
Giles,Cause the resemblance is striking.
Buffy,"I know.  Giles, you just have to-- (sees his subtle movement) Stop inching! (hurt feelings) You were inching!"
Giles,"Look, I-I know what you're going to say, and-and, uh--"
Buffy,I'm Buffy.
Giles,"(a beat) All right, I didn't know what you were going to say. But that doesn't make you any less crazy."
Buffy,"Faith switched.  I mean, she had some device.  She switched our bodies.  Giles, I swear. (imploringly, as she brushes a long lock of brown hair from her face) It's me."
Giles,"W--um, if-if you are Buffy, (he puts everything down on his desk) then, uh, then you'll let me tie you up, w-without killing me. Until we find out whether you're telling the truth."
Buffy,"Giles, Faith has taken my body, and for all I know, she's taken it to Mexico by now.  I-I don't have time for bondage fun. (Giles is taken aback) Ask me a question.  Ask me anything."
Giles,Who's president?
Buffy,"We're checking for Buffy, not a concussion."
Giles,"Oh, yes.  Right.  Um--"
Buffy,"(turns, sighing impatiently) This is-- (faces him again) Giles, you turned into a demon and I knew it was you!  I mean, can't you just look in my eyes and be all . . intuitive?"
Giles,(pointedly) How did I turn into a demon?
Buffy,"Oh!  Cause, uh, Ethan Rayne.  And-and you have a girlfriend named Olivia.  And you haven't had a job since we blew up the school --which is valid, lifestyle wise.  I mean, it's not like you're a slacker type, but (Giles seems embarrassed by this) . . . Oh, oh! When I had psychic power, I heard my mom think that you were like a stevedore during sex.  Wh--? (off his look) Do you want me to continue?"
Giles,"Actually, I beg you to stop."
Buffy,What's a stevedore?
Giles,"All right, let's . . . um, I need you to explain everything."
Buffy,"And I will, *after* we get Faith."
Willow,Giles! (sees Buffy)
Buffy,Will.
Willow,"Oh, my God."
Buffy,"Willow, wait.  You don't understand."
Willow,(casually) You're Buffy.  You and Faith switched bodies. (to Giles) Probably through a Draconian katra spell.
Giles,(raises his eyebrows) She understands it better than I do.
Buffy,How did you--?
Willow,"Tara. (to Tara) Tara, this is Buffy.  Only really, this time."
Tara,(waves shyly) Hi.
Willow,(smiling) Tara's a really powerful witch.
Tara,(sheepishly) Not really.
Willow,"No, really.  She knew right away that you weren't you.  So we connected with the nether realms to find out what happened.  And we conjured this."
Buffy,What is--?
Willow,"It's a katra.  Or the home-conjured version.  (hands it to Giles) It-it should switch you back, if you can get a hold of Faith."
Buffy,(sighs in relief) Thank God.
Giles,I'll get it. (picks up the phone) Hello.
Buffy,Do you know where Faith is?
Giles,"(into phone) Oh, yes.  Uh, Buffy's here with, with me. Actually, she-she's, uh-- Oh, all right."
Giles,Xander.  Apparently there's a report on the television.
Newswoman,". . . and barricaded themselves in the church with at least 20 parishioners. (cut to TV and a church is in the background behind the woman) One of the few who escaped described the three men as frighteningly disfigured, (closing shot of Buffy as she listens) almost inhuman.  So far, one escapee has since died of severe neck wounds."
Newswoman,"There is no report on the condition of the parishioners still trapped inside, but their assailants have vowed to kill all of them if police attempt to storm the church."
Boone,"It's hard to believe.  I've been avoiding this place for so many years, and it's nothing.  It's nice! (turns to face the frightened parishioners) It's got the pretty windows, the pillars . . . lots of folks to eat. (a few gasps from the folks) Where's the thing I was so afraid of?  You know, the Lord?  He was supposed to be here.  He gave us this address. (sighs) Well, we'll just have to start killing off His people. (more gasps) See if He shows up."
Riley,What'd he say?
Sergeant,(not happy) He said I should defer command to you.
Riley,Then you hold your men until the reserves arrive.  This is a military situation.
Sergeant,"What, they got bombs in there?"
Riley,Your men are not prepared to deal with them.  Just trust me.
Riley,Buffy!
Faith,How many are in there?
Riley,We think there's three.
Faith,(turning) I can do three.
Riley,"Not alone!  Look, wait for the troops to get here.  They're still mobilizing."
Faith,How did you respond so fast?
Riley,I didn't. (shrugs) I was just late for church.
Faith,"Look, when the troops get here, send em in.  But I'm going."
Riley,(grabs her arm) I don't want you risking--
Faith,(sharply) Don't tell me what to do!
Faith,(forced conviction) I'm Buffy.  I have to do this.
Riley,(nods) Then I'm coming with.
Riley,(painfilled) Oww!
Faith,"(bluntly) I can't use you.  Someone comes out, you get em to safety. (turning) Unless they've got fangs."
Boone,"I told the cops, they send anyone in I start the whole massacre thing."
Faith,"(shrugging) Well, I'm not the cops.  I just come to pray."
Boone,Now's a good time to start.
Faith,(a couple more steps) You're *not* gonna kill these people.
Boone,(bored) Why not?
Faith,(meaningfully) Because it's wrong.
Boone,You're the slayer.
Faith,The one and only.
Sergeant,"You people, get out of here!"
Willow,We've gotta get inside!
Sergeant,"The police are handling this.  Now just back off, right now!"
Willow,But we can't!  We've gotta-- Y-you don't understand!
Sergeant,"Listen, you have to clear the area--"
Giles,"(shouting) Damn it, man!  We have to get inside!  Our, uh, uh, (glances at Willow with a what the hell I am doing look) families are-are in there!  Our, uh, m-mothers and-and tiny, tiny babies!"
Boone,You think we're afraid of you?  We're not afraid of anything anymore.
Faith,"Then let all these people go, and all three of you can take me on."
Boone,(standing in front of her) Heh.  I got a better idea.
Riley,(holding up the coat) You forgot your coat. (drops it)
Buffy,Riley!
Riley,"Oh!  It's okay, miss.  Just get yourself out of harm's way."
Buffy,Riley.  It's me!  Uh-- (off his look) Never mind.  How many are in there?
Riley,Well-- (stops and looks at her) Who are you?
Boone,"I have strength you couldn't dream of.  (punches her hard in the face) Adam has shown me the way, (punches her again) and there is nothing--"
Buffy,You can't win this.
Faith,"(enraged, with tears in her eyes) SHUT UP!  Do you think I'm afraid of you!?"
Faith,(screaming at herself) You're nothing!  Disgusting!  Murderous bitch! (grabs her head and pounds it against the floor) You're nothing! (starts punching her again) You're disgusting!
Buffy,"She's gone.  Not a trace.  Giles said the council guys have cleared out, too."
Riley,"I don't understand.  How could she have--? (sighs) I mean, how's it possible?"
Buffy,Magic.
Riley,"There was something.  I should've picked up on it.  I should've just . . . (trails off, shaking his head)"
Buffy,(finally) You slept with her.
Riley,I slept with you.
Riley,"Man, would I like to get my hands on her. (quickly) Not in a sex way."
Buffy,(hollow voice) I don't think she's coming back.
Riley,(OS) I guess she's had her fun.
Buffy,(hollow) Yeah . . .
Buffy,Fun.
