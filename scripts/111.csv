GILES VOICEOVER,Previously...
SPIKE VOICEOVER,Last night changed things.
BUFFY,The only thing that's different is that I'm disgusted with myself.
DAWN,Is this the way to the movies?
DAWN,What is this place?
WILLOW,I'll just be a minute.
BUFFY,Willow's into something. Her and Dawn have been missing for hours.
DAWN,Do you know how long I've been out here?
WILLOW,(with black eyes) Let's get outta here.
WILLOW,"Dawnie, I'm sorry!"
BUFFY,You could have killed her!
WILLOW,I need help!
WILLOW,No more spells. I'm finished.
WARREN,Got it.
JONATHAN,It's beautiful.
WARREN,"Congratulations, Phase One of the plan is now complete."
Open on a table covered with magical stuff,"tarot cards, candles, little bowls and boxes of herbs, etc."
DAWN,Candles?! We can't have candles?
BUFFY,"Dawn, it's magic clearance. Everything must go."
DAWN,B-but they're just candles!
BUFFY,"(sighs, stands up) Well, yeah, you know, to you and me they're just candles, but to ... witches they're ... like bongs."
BUFFY,"So, no candles, no charms ... (walking toward the door to the bathroom) no-"
WILLOW,Bird.
BUFFY,(stops walking) No bird?
WILLOW,That peacock on the table. (looks at the side table near Buffy) It has two crystals in it.
WILLOW,"Tara, she... (Buffy looking at her) she left them. (Dawn looking at them)"
BUFFY,I'll make sure she gets them.
BUFFY,"(over her shoulder) Dawn, do me a favor, can you grab the fertility god statue on the desk over there?"
DAWN,Kokopelli?! No! I love him! And he was Mom's.
DAWN,(upset) Why do we have to get rid of so many things I like?
BUFFY,"Dawn, I explained this to you. Willow has a problem. The next few weeks are gonna be ... crazy hard on her as it is."
BUFFY,"(on the sofa, moving cushions around) Any reminder of, of what it is that she's trying to stay away from, you know, could cause her to ... give in to temptation."
BUFFY,And that would be bad.
WARREN,"(triumphant) Okay, that's it. It's finally done."
WARREN,"I mean, it still needs a trial run, but it's-"
JONATHAN,Kind of clunky-looking.
WARREN,What?!
ANDREW,"I pictured something cooler. More ILM, less Ed Wood."
WARREN,(gets up angrily) You wanna see cool? I'll show you cool.
JONATHAN,Mama!
JONATHAN,Did it ... is it...
ANDREW,Yeah.
JONATHAN,"(laughing, to Warren) I'd call that a successful test."
WARREN,"Well, that's just half the test."
JONATHAN,Hey! Hey!
JONATHAN,You penis!
WARREN,"Oh, cheer up, Frodo. Because thanks to my brains, and our mystical gem, we got ourselves an invisibility ray. (shoulders the weapon) And I'd say that makes us pretty much unstoppable."
BUFFY,"Dawn, come on, you gotta eat breakfast! Xander's gonna be here any second."
BUFFY,She's gonna be late for school again.
BUFFY,How are you doing?
WILLOW,"I'm okay. Not 'ready to head back to classes, face the world' okay, but ... the shakiness is only semi now. I thought I'd spend the day fishing the net, for more poop on the, uh, stolen diamond."
BUFFY,I called you before.
DAWN,(sullen) Didn't hear you.
WILLOW,"Hey Dawnie, uh, I'm making you a nice omelet."
DAWN,Not hungry. (drinks juice)
BUFFY,"Dawn, you need to eat something."
DAWN,Thanks for your concern.
WILLOW,"Okay, I deserve the wrath of Dawn, but ... why is she taking it out on you?"
BUFFY,Because I let it happen.
WILLOW,"Buffy, I was the one who-"
BUFFY,Who was drowning. My best friend. And I was too wrapped up in my own dumb life to even notice.
SPIKE,Morning.
BUFFY,"What are you doing? And, here? (Willow returns to cooking)"
SPIKE,"Just, uh, took a stroll. Found myself in your neck of the woods."
BUFFY,Couldn't find a less flammable time of day to take a stroll?
SPIKE,"Yeah, well, the fact is my lighter's gone missing. Thought it might have, uh, dropped outta my pocket the last time I was here."
BUFFY,Haven't seen it.
WILLOW,"I'm, uh, gonna head back to my room, get dressed."
BUFFY,"Oh, I..."
BUFFY,Lame.
SPIKE,What?
BUFFY,You. Making up excuses. (goes back to the sink)
SPIKE,"Oh, don't flatter yourself, luv. (walking toward her) Bloody fond of that lighter."
BUFFY,Stop trying to see me. And stop calling me that.
SPIKE,"(walks over to her) So, um ... what should I call you then? Pet?"
SPIKE,"(grinning) Sweetheart? My, uh ... (fondling a piece of her hair) little goldilocks?"
SPIKE,You know I love this hair. The way it bounces around when you-
SPIKE,Ah-ah-ah! This flapjack's not ready to be flipped.
BUFFY,What the hell is that supposed to-
BUFFY,(whispers) Stop that.
XANDER,"Good Godfrey Cambridge, Spike!"
XANDER,"Still trying to mack on Buffy? Wake up already. Never gonna happen! (Spike and Buffy glaring at him) Only a complete loser would ever hook up with you. (Buffy looking insulted) Well, unless she's a simpleton like Harmony, or a, or a nut sack like Drusilla-"
BUFFY,"Hey! You really need to get Dawn off to school. Let's go, go fetch her, okay?"
BUFFY,"(not turning back) You can let yourself out, right Spike?"
BUFFY,"(calling) Dawn! You better get going, Xander's here!"
DAWN,Here.
BUFFY,"Okay, you have everything you need?"
DAWN,(interrupting) Yep.
BUFFY,"And after school, you-"
DAWN,"Yeah yeah. Let's go, Xander. (walking toward the door)"
BUFFY,(intercepting her) You will come straight home.
DAWN,(sarcastic) Sure. Maybe we can find some time for you to (Buffy opens door) get me into another car accident.
MS. KROGER,"(removing her glasses, smiling at Dawn) Oh, good morning. You must be Dawn. (Dawn nods)"
BUFFY,Can I help you?
MS. KROGER,"I'm Doris Kroger, from Social Services. (displaying her ID badge) We had an appointment?"
BUFFY,"Oh, for Wednesday."
MS. KROGER,This is Wednesday.
BUFFY,"Right! Well ... Dawn, you better..."
BUFFY,"(sighs) And, and Xander, you'll drive safely?"
XANDER,Yes ma'am.
MS. KROGER,"(smiles at Buffy) Little bit on the tardy side, isn't she?"
BUFFY,"(closing door) Yeah, well, uh, it's been one of those mornings, you know. (notices that Ms. Kroger has already gone into the living room) Hey, come on in."
BUFFY,"Sorry about the mess, you know, doing a little house-cleaning."
SPIKE,"So, we gonna chat this out, or what?"
BUFFY,"(nervous) Uh ... now's really not a-a good time. Um, I have company. (indicates Ms. Kroger)"
SPIKE,(making himself comfortable) No worries. I'll wait.
MS. KROGER,"Um, Miss Summers, if you and your boyfriend would like to-"
BUFFY,He is NOT-
BUFFY,"(clears throat) Not my, my boyfriend, he's, um, just ... a..."
BUFFY,"Spike ... this nice woman is, uh, (meaningfully) from Social Services?"
SPIKE,"Oh, right! (gets up) Uh ... hey! Buffy's a great mom. She takes good care of her little sis. (Both Buffy and Ms. Kroger smiling) Like, um, when Dawn was hanging out too much in my crypt, Buffy put a right stop to it."
MS. KROGER,"(frowning) I'm sorry, did you say-"
BUFFY,Crib! (fake laugh) He said crib. You know kids today and their buggin' street slang.
BUFFY,"Uh, Spike, didn't you have to go now, you know, because of that thing?"
SPIKE,"Uh, thing, yeah. Uh, my blanket."
MS. KROGER,He sleeps here?
BUFFY,"What? No! No. Oh, uh, the, the, the blanket. That's, um, uh, it's a security thing, you know. He ... has issues. Nope, just me and Dawn living here."
WILLOW,"(OS, calling from upstairs) Buffy, I'm not feeling hot, so uh, I'm gonna take a quick nap, okay?"
BUFFY,"(calling) Okay, Will!"
BUFFY,"That's Willow. She, uh, she kind of lives here too, actually."
MS. KROGER,"Oh, so you live with another woman."
BUFFY,"Oh! Oh, it's not a, a gay thing, you know, I mean, well..."
BUFFY,"...she's gay, but, but we don't ... gay. Not that there's anything - (notices Ms. Kroger looking at the herb) Oh! Wrong with... (rushes over) You know, I know what that looks like, but I, I swear, it's not ... what it looks like. (Ms. Kroger looking shocked) It's *magic* weed."
BUFFY,It's not mine.
MS. KROGER,I think I've seen enough.
BUFFY,"No, a-actually, I really don't think that you have. It's just ... i-it's been kind of, kind of a, a bad time."
MS. KROGER,"It's been a bad time now for a while, hasn't it, Ms. Summers? Your sister's grades have fallen sharply in the last year, due in large part to her frequent absences and lateness."
BUFFY,But there-there are good reasons.
MS. KROGER,"Oh, I'm sure there are. But my interest is in Dawn's welfare. And the stability of her home life, something I'm just not convinced that an unemployed young woman like yourself can provide."
BUFFY,"I can. I, I do!"
MS. KROGER,"Well, we'll just have to see about that then, won't we?"
MS. KROGER,"Oh, and I'm, uh, going to recommend immediate probation in my report."
BUFFY,What does that mean?
MS. KROGER,"It means that I'll be monitoring you very closely, Ms. Summers. And if I don't see that things are improving, well, I'll be forced to recommend that you be stripped of your sister's guardianship."
BUFFY,You can't do that.
MS. KROGER,(opens the door) I do what is in Dawn's best interest ... as should you. Have a nice day.
SPIKE,"Didn't go well, huh?"
BUFFY,(quietly) Why won't you go?
SPIKE,(surprised) I just thought you'd want-
BUFFY,(harshly) Get out of here!
SPIKE,"Just getting what I came for, luv."
SPIKE,"(not looking back) So long, goldilocks."
CLEO,"Well, I-I think I can work with this."
CLEO,What exactly would you like me to do?
BUFFY,Just make me ... different.
ANDREW,"I'm scared, what if we get caught?"
JONATHAN,"No way, we'll be invisible. Plus their security's gotten lax."
WARREN,(chuckles) You should know. You've cased this joint enough.
"They emerge from the alley onto a main street, turn the corner and approach a large storefront. The sign in the window reads","""Spa, Women Only. Bikini Wax Wednesdays"" and a cartoon picture of a woman."
WARREN,"Okay, this is it."
WARREN,Remember...
WARREN,...we're professionals.
ANDREW,"(nudging Jonathan nervously) Uh, Slayer!"
WARREN,What? Wh-where?
ANDREW,There. Headed this way.
JONATHAN,(OS) Give it!
ANDREW,"No, I need to be invisible!"
JONATHAN,"I need it more, Buffy can't see me!"
WARREN,"Hey, watch it, don't you-"
ANDREW,Oopsie.
XANDER,What happened to Buffy? She's gone.
ANYA,She's right here.
ANYA,(points) Table four. I put her with your family.
XANDER,"Great. Except, we don't hate Buffy."
XANDER,(OS) Let's put her back at table one. (The door closes again and the camera pulls back into the shop)
ANYA,"(OS) Well, where do I put D'Hoffryn?"
XANDER,(OS) We're not inviting D'Hoffryn.
ANYA,"We have to, he's my ex-boss! You're inviting your work buddies."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,She's got a point.
XANDER,"Hey, Buffy..."
XANDER,Where ... where are you?
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"At table four, apparently."
ANYA,"(frowning, looking around) Well, that remains to be seen. Like you."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Don't strain yourself looking, Xander. I'm invisible girl."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Uh, Xander?"
XANDER,"(nervous laugh) Sorry! (to Anya) Her clothes are ... invisible ... too. (to the empty air where he thinks Buffy is) Buffy, how did this hap ... wait a sec, have you been feeling ... ignored lately?"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Yeah, ignored. I wish. No, this isn't a Marcie deal. I don't know what happened. I left Main Street after getting my hair cut, and-"
ANYA,You cut your hair?
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Oh, yeah!"
ANYA,Really? How short?
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Um, about up to here ... well, if you could see my hand, it's kind of above my shoulders."
ANYA,"Ahh, that sounds so adorable! I was thinking about getting my hair cut before the wed-"
XANDER,Can we get back to freaking out about no-show Buffy? (Anya looks chastised) This is serious.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,I know. It kind of fits the day I've had.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Willow's still a wreck, Dawn's mad at both of us, and the social services lady put me through a wringer. Says she's gonna watch me. I'd like to see her try now."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"You know, there may be an upside to no-see-me. (the balls float over toward Anya)"
XANDER,"Buff, did you say anyone, or ... anything suspicious before you ... cleared out?"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Nope, didn't see nothin'. (laughs) See what I did there, with the eyeballs?"
ANYA,"(nervously, to Xander) Why would anyone make her invisible anyway? I mean, invisible Slayer's gotta be way more effective than the standard variety."
XANDER,"Yeah, I'm less with the why and more with the how. We get the how, then we got how to make her unseen sight seen again, right?"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,'Saright!
XANDER,"(annoyed) Buffy, could you focus please?"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,(making the skull 'look around') I am! Just ... this is kind of fun.
ANYA,"Well, it would help if we had a little bit more to go on. Or ... anything to go on."
XANDER,"Well, I could go check the spot where Buffy disappeared. Snoop for clues."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"(putting skull back on a shelf) Yeah, right. Uh, hey, you know what? I'm just gonna ... go for a walk. (footsteps heading toward the door)"
XANDER,A walk?
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Yeah. Um, clear my head. (Xander following her toward the door) You guys keep working on those whats and hows. (laughs) Clear my head."
XANDER,Buffy!
ANYA,"Well, seems pretty obvious it's some kind of spell that's done this to her."
XANDER,"Spell from who? You said it yourself, it makes no sense for one of her enemies to make her invisible."
ANYA,Maybe it's a mistake.
XANDER,A magical mistake. (small laugh) Who'd be messing with that kind of pow-
XANDER,Willow.
WILLOW,(OS) Xander!
XANDER,How's it going?
WILLOW,"Um ... good. (Xander sits) I, I, uh, found ... out some stuff about the diamond stolen from the museum. (Xander not really listening) It's called the Illuminata, and there's rumors of it having quasi-mystical quantum properties."
XANDER,"Willow, we need to talk."
WILLOW,"(nervous) We ... are talking. Well, I'm talking and you're looking at me funny."
XANDER,Is there something you wanna tell me?
WILLOW,"It was nothing, I ... I-I didn't slip."
XANDER,"Will, nobody's mad. Relapse is a part of recovery, we understand that. We just have to figure a way to fix it."
WILLOW,(confused) Fix what?
XANDER,Fix Buffy.
WILLOW,Buffy's broken?
XANDER,"Will, you know what I'm talki - (sees her expression) You don't know."
XANDER,Rhymes with ... 'blinvisible'?
WILLOW,What?
XANDER,"Buffy was in town, leaving the haircutting place, when she suddenly just-"
WILLOW,Buffy got her hair cut?
XANDER,"(sarcastic) Yeah! Adorable, apparently. I personally couldn't tell, since she's all 'blinvisible.'"
WILLOW,(upset) And you think I had something to do with this?
XANDER,"Uh, no ... not ... (sighs) Well, come on, Will. Some of the spells you've done have caused some weird stuff to happen to each of us at one time or another. And let's not forget the recent forgetting."
WILLOW,"Oh. I see, so now when anything nasty happens, I get conveniently blamed for it?"
XANDER,No one's blaming!
WILLOW,(stands up) So ... I guess it wouldn't matter if I just jump off the wagon completely ... since you already think I'm making pit stops.
XANDER,"Well, look, if you said you didn't do it - (Willow grabs her coat and goes past him) Willow, where you going?"
WILLOW,For a walk.
WARREN,"Couple of circuits are burned out, and the wiring's all fried."
ANDREW,"But we had so many plans. Naked women, and all ... well, all-all the naked women. (to Jonathan) This is all your fault, if you hadn't grabbed it from me-"
JONATHAN,"Hey, we got a lot bigger problems here, bonehead. The Slayer's invisible now?"
ANDREW,"He's right. (to Warren) She could be anywhere. (Warren stops working, looks at him) Even here, right now."
ANDREW,"(quietly) Watching. Listening to every word we say. (very dramatically) For all we know, she could be one of us!"
ANDREW,"Oh, wait, no, guys, that isn't true."
WARREN,(returning to his work) I wouldn't sweat the Slayer too much.
JONATHAN,Says you. In my book an invisible slayer means a whole world of trouble.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,(spooky voice) I am the ghost of fashion victims past. (normal voice) Studded caps? Not a good idea.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Hey! I'm doing you a favor!
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Naah ... too easy.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Hmm...
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"So long, copper!"
COP,Hey ... Hey! That's mine! Stop!
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Hello, Mrs. Kroger."
MS. KROGER,(confused) What - Where's my...
MS. KROGER,(joking) Losing my mind.
MS. KROGER,"(annoyed) Okay, who's the-"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"(softly) Kill, kill, kill!"
MS. KROGER,What?
COWORKER,I didn't say anything.
MS. KROGER,"Not you! The mug, it's-"
MS. KROGER,But I ... I heard something.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Kill, Doris. Kill everybody."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,You know you want to.
MS. KROGER,"(yelling at the mug) Shut up, shut up, just shut up!"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Okay ... no ... no...
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Yahtzee!
BOSS,"Uh, Doris!"
BOSS,"I've, uh, got a few, so if you wanna discuss that case file now..."
MS. KROGER,"What? Oh! Oh yes, the, um, Summers file, it's, uh, it's right over here."
MS. KROGER,"Uh, it's a fifteen-year-old girl, living under her older sister's guardianship. The house is a complete-"
BOSS,What is this? (reading) 'All work and no play make Doris a dull girl'?
MS. KROGER,What?
BOSS,'All work and no play make Doris' - the pages are filled with it.
MS. KROGER,I ... I...
MS. KROGER,"I, I, I didn't do this, I ..."
MS. KROGER,(softly) It was the voice.
BOSS,Excuse me?
MS. KROGER,"There was a voice, before. It made my coffee dance. It told me to- (breaks off)"
BOSS,To ... what?
MS. KROGER,(nervously) Nothing.
BOSS,Doris ... take the rest of the day off. See your doctor.
MS. KROGER,But what about my cases?
BOSS,"We'll, uh ... put someone else on them. And have them redo the Summers interview."
MS. KROGER,I'm not crazy. I am not crazy!
BOSS,"Well, no one said that you were."
XANDER,Hey Will. (she turns) Whatcha doin'?
WILLOW,"(defensive) Look, Xander, I - I figured out this was where Buffy disappeared from what you told me, so don't start jumping to any conclusions."
XANDER,"(holds up his hands) No jumping, look, feet firmly planted. (smiles)"
WILLOW,"(embarrassed) I'm not feeling like myself right now, sorry."
XANDER,Me too. Sorry. (she nods) So! What have we found out so far?
WILLOW,"Well, take a look at that! (points)"
WILLOW,"Something sped outta here pretty dann quick to, to make that kind of tread mark."
XANDER,"Well, this could have been made any time."
WILLOW,"Yeah, but this ... wasn't."
XANDER,What is it?
WILLOW,(walking away) Paint that I scraped off the fire hydrant.
XANDER,What fire hydrant? (clanking noise) Ow!
WILLOW,That one.
WILLOW,"Whatever hit this fire hydrant hit it after it was made invisible. And betcha by golly wow, that something was the same something that shot out of that alley."
XANDER,(pondering) Black paint? Buffy's phantom van. (Willow nods) We gotta let Buffy - whoa!
XANDER,There's something there. (pointing)
WILLOW,"I-it's a pylon, one of those orange traffic cones. (continues spraying) You should take it to the Magic Box. It might help you and Anya figure out what kind of spell was used."
XANDER,What about you?
WILLOW,"(stands up) Well, I got paint scrapings... (gives Xander the paint can and takes the vial from him) ...and a tire mark. I'm gonna find this van that's been stalking Buffy. (Xander nods) By the way, where *is* Buffy?"
WOMAN ON TV,"(screaming) Oh my god, the blood! Look at all the blood!"
SPIKE,"Whatever beastie you are, I know you're here. And I hurt beasties."
Invisible Buffy's POV,"moving past Spike from behind, looking down toward his butt and then onward."
SPIKE,"Hey, watch it."
SPIKE,"A ghost, is it? (looking around) Go and haunt the living, like a good spook."
SPIKE,(tentatively) Buffy?
INVISIBLE BUFFY,I told you ... stop trying to see me.
ANYA,"Oh, I got it!"
XANDER,Really?
ANYA,"Yeah, we'll put D'Hoffryn at your parents' table, and move your Uncle Rory to table five near the bar."
XANDER,"Ahn honey, we're looking for invisibility spells here."
ANYA,"Well, obviously I haven't found anything yet. At least nothing that would explain why things near Buffy become invisible."
ANYA,Ew! Xander!
XANDER,What happened?
ANYA,"An unpleasant tactile experience, like putting my hand in pudding."
XANDER,Ew!
ANYA,"Like pudding, am I right? Rice, or tapioca, lumpy like that."
XANDER,"We have to find Buffy, she's gotta know."
ANYA,(brushing off her hand) I don't think Buffy's gonna be too broken up over a pylon.
XANDER,"Anya, whatever's happening to the pylon will probably happen to her. If we don't find Buffy, I-I mean ... if we don't figure out how this was done..."
ANYA,She's pudding?
JONATHAN,What do you mean she's gonna fade away?
WARREN,"The Slayer got slammed with a big-ass dose of radiation when the gun overloaded. Her cells are mutating at an accelerated rate. Eventually her molecular makeup will start losing its integrity and then ... pfft. (makes a ""pfft"" gesture)"
ANDREW,"But, wouldn't that kill her?"
WARREN,"Well, lemme think. (sarcastic) Yeah!"
JONATHAN,Wait a minute! We're not killing anybody. Especially not Buffy!
WARREN,(sighs) You guys are so immature! (angrily) We're villains! When are you gonna get that through your thick skulls?
JONATHAN,"We're not killers, we're crime lords!"
ANDREW,"Yeah! Like, like Lex Luthor. (gesturing with a comic book) He's always trying to take over Metropolis, but he doesn't kill Superman!"
WARREN,"Because it's Superman's book, you moron!"
ANDREW,"But Lex doesn't kill him, does he?!"
JONATHAN,"Listen, Warren ... (points forcefully at the gun) you get that ray working and the first thing we're gonna do is find Buffy and re-visible her before it's too late!"
JONATHAN,You got me?!
WARREN,Fine.
WARREN,Whatever you guys say.
XANDER,Spike?
XANDER,Spike?
XANDER,What are you doing?
SPIKE,"What am I ... What does it look like I'm doing, you nit? I'm exercising, aren't I?"
XANDER,Exercising. (comes closer) Naked. In bed.
SPIKE,A man shouldn't use immortality as an excuse to let himself go. Gotta keep fit for the killing. (sits on the edge of the bed)
XANDER,(skeptical) Yuh-huh. Looks like you had a little trouble upstairs. (gestures with his head) Mini-disaster area.
SPIKE,"So what, you just come here to criticize my housekeeping?"
XANDER,"No, uh, no. I'm looking for Buf-"
SPIKE,(quickly) Haven't seen her.
XANDER,"Well, uh, you wouldn't. The fact is, she's come down with a slight case of invisibility."
SPIKE,"(fake surprise) Yeah? How did, uh..."
XANDER,We don't know yet.
XANDER,"Anyway, she's not at the house, and I really, really need to find her."
SPIKE,"(fidgeting) Uh, tell you what, I'll ... take a peek around first chance I get... (makes swatting noises next to his head) and if we bump into each other, I'll clue her that you're on the lookout. (trying not to laugh)"
XANDER,(uncertain) After your ... (gestures) exercises.
SPIKE,"(more swatting) Yeah, right."
XANDER,"You know, kidding aside, Spike ... you really should get a girlfriend."
SPIKE,That was bloody stupid.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,What's the matter? Ashamed to be seen with me?
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Come on. He had no idea I was here. This is perfect.
SPIKE,Perfect for you. (begins filling the glass from a bottle)
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Well, picture me confused. (Spike shaking his head) I thought this was what you wanted."
SPIKE,(annoyed sigh) What I want...
SPIKE,"This vanishing act's right liberating for you, innit? Go anywhere you want. Do anything you want. (walks along the bed, holding the glass) Or anyone."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,What are you talking ab-
SPIKE,"The only reason you're here, is that you're not here. (drinking)"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Right. Of course, as usual there's something wrong with Buffy. She came back all wrong. (moving around on the bed) You know, I didn't ask for this to happen to me."
SPIKE,"Not too put off by it though, are you? (drinking)"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,No! Maybe because for the first time since ... I'm free.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Free of rules and reports ... free of this life.
SPIKE,Free of life? Got another name for that. Dead.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Why do you always have to ... (pouty) I thought we were having fun.
SPIKE,"Yeah, now! But sooner or later your chums are gonna work out a way to bring you back to living color. (lets her go) You need to go. Get dressed if you can find your clothes, and push off. 'Cause if I can't have all of you, I'd rather-"
SPIKE,"Okay, that's cheating."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,I don't believe this.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"He threw *me* out? He threw *me*. Did I, like, fall into some ... backward dimension here? Is this Bizarro World? (kicks the can again) And after he's always going on and on about being the only one that understands me. 'We're alike, you and me. Birds of a bloody feather.' Uh! He's so ... (annoyed sigh)"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Hey, I'm walking here!"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Insensitive! (kicks the can) That's what he is.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Willow? Willow! (walks further into the kitchen) Dawn? Hey, Dawn, come here. You wanna see something neat?"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,There you are!
DAWN,Buffy? W-where are you?
INVISIBLE BUFFY,I'm invisible. Check this out.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Wooo, wooo! Unidentified flying pizza, comin' in for a landing."
DAWN,W-what are you talking-
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Okay, not the most clever ad lib, but come on! Points for spontaneity."
DAWN,(upset) Stop it! Just ... stop. (moving closer to the island)
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Sorry Dawn. I'm, I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to freak you out."
DAWN,"Well, what did you think would happen? You're freaking invisible, Buffy."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,I know. Xander and Anya are working on it. Muldering out what happened. (moving around toward the stove)
DAWN,"Well, what about you? Shouldn't you be working on it?"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Of course I-
DAWN,"Do you even care about, about who did this to you, or, or if you're gonna be stuck this way? You're making jokes and flying pizzas."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,I don't think that's-
DAWN,(upset) I can't talk to you like this. I can't see you! How can I talk to you if I can't see you?
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Dawn! Dawn!
XANDER,"(on machine) Buffy, it's Xander. Where are you? Listen ... we got a new problem here."
ANYA,(on machine) Tell her!
XANDER,(on machine) I'm trying to. Anya and I think whatever made you invisible is slowly killing you.
ANYA,(on machine) Tell her about the pudding!
XANDER,"(on machine) Anya! Buff, if we don't ... if this isn't reversed, you're gonna ... well, dissolve, or ... fade ... into nothing."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Wow.
WARREN,(OS) Now!
WILLOW,Hey! Let go of me!
INVISIBLE WARREN,Congratulations. You're our first hostage.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Dawn, I'm going out to find Xander. If he calls me-"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Xander?
JONATHAN,"(on phone) Don't talk. Just listen, Slayer. You don't have a lot of time."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Who is this? You sound familiar.
JONATHAN,"(disguising his voice) I'm ... nobody. No one you know. We've got your friend Willow, and if you don't want anything nasty to happen to her, you better meet us. Alone."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Where?
INVISIBLE WARREN,"Just stay still, and you won't get hurt."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"You okay, Will?"
WILLOW,Buffy?
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Where are the bad guys?
INVISIBLE WARREN,"All around you, Slayer, so don't try anything."
WILLOW,"He's bluffing, Buffy, there, there's just three of them, I think."
INVISIBLE WARREN,"More than enough to cause some serious carnage, right guys? ... Guys? Guys!"
INVISIBLE JONATHAN,Kick! Use the kick!
INVISIBLE ANDREW,"I tried that, he keeps blocking it with his drunken monkey fist!"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Ooh, scary video carnage."
INVISIBLE WARREN,Hey! Slayer's here.
INVISIBLE ANDREW,"Sorry, didn't see her."
INVISIBLE WARREN,"Why don't we continue this in a less crowded area, like, over there."
ALL,Where?
INVISIBLE WARREN,Over ... follow me.
WILLOW,Ow!
INVISIBLE BUFFY,I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess you guys are the ones who did this to me?
INVISIBLE JONATHAN,It was an accident!
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Who's that?
INVISIBLE JONATHAN,(disguised voice) Nobody you know.
WILLOW,They're the ones from your mystery van.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Oh. You. So what annoying thing are you gonna do to me now?
INVISIBLE WARREN,"Save your life, make you visible."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Right. I'm supposed to believe that?
WILLOW,"They told me everything, Buffy. Something's happening to you that, you're-"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Fading away. I know.
INVISIBLE WARREN,I can fix that.
INVISIBLE WARREN,Pick up that air hockey mallet on the table.
INVISIBLE BUFFY,What for?
INVISIBLE WARREN,It'll give me a target to aim at. (Willow looking at the invisibility ray)
INVISIBLE WARREN,"Okay, now hold still, and all your troubles will soon be gone."
WILLOW,You're on the wrong setting!
INVISIBLE WARREN,What?
WILLOW,"The gun, it's not set for reversing the particle ionization. It'll accelerate her molecular dissolution, I saw the plans!"
INVISIBLE WARREN,Mind your own business.
INVISIBLE JONATHAN,What's she talking about?
INVISIBLE BUFFY,That's what I'd like to know.
WILLOW,"Buffy, he's trying to kill you!"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Willow!
INVISIBLE WARREN,Ow!
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Okay, play time's over."
INVISIBLE WARREN,"You haven't won yet, Slayer."
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"No, that part comes after I beat the snot out of you."
INVISIBLE WARREN,"You'll have to find me first! There's three of us, against just one of you."
INVISIBLE JONATHAN,"Hey, you lied to us!"
INVISIBLE ANDREW,Fight her yourself!
INVISIBLE WARREN,"(angrily) Think she cares about that? I go down, we all go down!"
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"And I promise, you're all going down."
INVISIBLE WARREN,"We may not have your powers, Slayer, but you'll find that we are not so easy to- (another air-hockey mallet hits him) Ow! Get her!"
INVISIBLE JONATHAN,"Wait a minute, wait a minute! Who's biting my leg?"
INVISIBLE ANDREW,Sorry! Where is she?
INVISIBLE BUFFY,Here.
INVISIBLE WARREN,She can't find us if we split up.
INVISIBLE WARREN,You go that way.
INVISIBLE JONATHAN,Which way?
INVISIBLE WARREN,That way! Over-
INVISIBLE BUFFY,"Just keep talking, boys."
INVISIBLE JONATHAN,Ow! Watch the chest hair!
INVISIBLE BUFFY,I know that voice. You-you're-
BUFFY,Jonathan?!
BUFFY,You have chest hair?
BUFFY,Warren?
BUFFY,(frowns) Who are you?
ANDREW,Andrew.
ANDREW,I summoned the flying monkeys that attacked the high school?
ANDREW,"During the school play, you know?"
WARREN,It's Tucker's brother.
JONATHAN,"Yeah, it's Tucker's brother."
BUFFY/WILLOW,Ohh.
BUFFY,"So you three have, what, banded together to be pains in my ass?"
WARREN,"(walking sideways with the other two following him) We're your arch-nemesises ... ses. (Buffy and Willow looking confused) You may have beaten us this time, Slayer, but next time ... um ... uh, next time..."
JONATHAN,Maybe not!
WARREN,"(OS) What do you mean, it's locked? You were supposed to check it!"
ANDREW,(OS) I forgot!
BUFFY,I give you my arch nemesises...ses. (frowns)
GUARD,What's going on in here? (Buffy and Willow turn to look at him) I got a bunch of scared kids saying this place is haunted!
WILLOW,"(surprised) Oh my god, Buffy!"
BUFFY,"(pouting) I know, they're gone. I guess we should chase them."
WILLOW,"No, your hair! (smiles) It *is* adorable."
BUFFY,"Pretty neat, you finding the van. (they begin walking down the street) So ... how did you manage to ... do it exactly? I mean, to locate it?"
WILLOW,"The hard way. The spell-free way. The oh-my-god-my-head's-gonna-fall-off, (grimaces, whines) my-feet-are-killing-me way."
WILLOW,I don't know how I got through this day.
BUFFY,"Well, the important thing is that you did. It's a ... good first step."
WILLOW,"How are you doing, post-invisibleness?"
BUFFY,(shrugs) Okay. I still have to do some damage control from my giddy-fest. Dawn was pretty freaked out. (pauses) The whole taking-a-vacation-from-me thing didn't work out so well.
WILLOW,(nods) Tell me about it.
BUFFY,"Except ... when I got Xander's message ... you know, that I was ... fading away ... I actually got scared."
WILLOW,"Well, yeah. Who wouldn't?"
BUFFY,"Me. I wouldn't. Not too long ago I probably would have welcomed it. But I realized ... I'm not saying that I'm doing back-flips about my life, but... (nods) I didn't ... I don't ... wanna die. (looks hopefully at Willow) That's something, right?"
WILLOW,It's something.
WILLOW,So I guess we both made good first steps.
BUFFY,I guess.
WILLOW,Yay for us.
BUFFY,Yay.
