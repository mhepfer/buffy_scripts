character,dialogue
Demon,(exhales) I will be whole. I will be new. (exhales)
Cordelia,Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all. I  decided long ago...
Cordelia,"...never to walk in anyone's shadow. (cut to Cordelia) If I  fail, if I succeed, at least..."
Giles,"(interrupts) Thank you, Cordelia. Tha-that's going to be lovely."
Cordelia,But I didn't do the part with the sparklers!
Giles,"Um, w-we'll, um... save that for the dress rehearsal. (anxious  to get rid of her) Uh, Lisa! Please!"
Cordelia,Uhhh!
Buffy,(draws a breath) If it isn't the great producer!
Xander,Had to see this to believe it.
Giles,Oh. You three.
Buffy,The school talent show. How ever did you finagle such a primo  assignment?
Giles,"Our new FÃ¼hrer, Mr. Snyder."
Willow,I think they call 'em 'principals' now.
Giles,"Mm. He thought it would behoove me to have more contact with the  students. I did try to explain that my vocational choice of librarian  was a deliberate attempt to (draws a breath) minimize said contact, but,  uh, he would have none of it."
Buffy,"Giles, unto every generation is born one who must run the annual  talentless show. You cannot escape your destiny."
Giles,"If you had any shred of decency, you would have participated, or  at least, um, helped."
Buffy,Nah! I think I'll take on your traditional role... and watch!
Xander,And mock!
Willow,And laugh!
Buffy,O-kay. I think maybe we better leave our Mr. Giles to this  business he calls a show.
Buffy,Principal Snyder!
Snyder,"So. We think school events are stupid, and we think authority  figures are to be made fun of."
Buffy,"No! No, we don't. W-unless you do."
Snyder,And we think our afternoon classes are optional. All three of  you left campus yesterday.
Buffy,"Yeah, but we were fighting a demon..."
Snyder,Fighting?
Buffy,Not fighting.
Xander,"No, we, uh, left to *avoid* fighting."
Snyder,"Real anti-social types. You need to integrate into this school,  people. (crosses his arms) I think I just found three eager new  participants for the talent show."
Buffy,What?
Xander,No!
Willow,Please?
Snyder,I've been watching you three. Always getting into one scrape or  another.
Buffy,"Well, we're really, really sorry, but about the talent show,  pleeease, you can't make us..."
Snyder,"(interrupts) My predecessor, Mr. Flutie, may have gone in for  all that touchy-feely relating nonsense, but he was eaten. You're in  *my* world now. And Sunnydale has touched and felt for the last time."
Xander,"Can I just mention, that detention is a time-honored form of  punishment?"
Snyder,I know the three of you will come up with a wonderful act for  the school to watch. And mock. And laugh. At.
Xander,No!
Giles,(to Lisa) Thank you!
Buffy,"Ewww, dummy!"
Xander,(sees a mime and jumps in his seat) Dyow! Mime!
Willow,(sits behind Buffy) I think dummies are cute. You don't?
Buffy,Uuuhhh. They give me the wig. Ever since I was little.
Willow,What happened?
Buffy,I saw a dummy. It gave me the wig. There really wasn't a story  there.
Morgan,(on stage) Hi. I'm Morgan. (moves the dummy's head) And I'm  Sid!
Morgan,"(as Sid) Hey Morgan, would you like to tell some jokes? (as  himself) Would I! (as Sid) As a matter of fact, it is! It's also a wood  nose, and a wood mouth!"
Morgan,(as Sid) I didn't sleep at all last night.
Sid,"Alright, time out. Let's stop this before someone gets hurt. (to  Morgan) Kid, you are the worst. Even I can see your lips move."
Morgan,"C'mon, Sid. You're spoiling my act. I worked on these jokes for  weeks."
Sid,You call those jokes? My jockey shorts are made out of better  material.
Sid,And they're edible!
Giles,"There, you see? I'm sure you three can come up with something...  equally exciting."
Emily,Is anybody there?
Emily,Hello?
Emily,Hello?
Demon,I will be flesh!
Marc,"I reach into the hat, and out... comes..."
Marc,Has anybody seen a rabbit?
Xander,I can't do this!
Buffy,"Xander, come on."
Xander,"I, I can't! I have my pride! Okay, I don't have a lot of my  pride, but I have enough so that I can't do this!"
Willow,"A dramatic scene is the easiest way to get through the talent  show, because it doesn't require an actual talent. (sits above him)"
Xander,"But we have talent. We can do stuff. Buffy, uh..."
Buffy,(also sitting now) What am I gonna do? Slay vampires on stage?
Willow,Maybe in a funny way!
Xander,"Willow, you can do stuff. Uh, the piano..."
Buffy,You play?
Willow,A little.
Buffy,"Well, that's cool. You can accompany us and we can *attempt* to  sing."
Willow,"Oh, i-in front of other people? Then, no, I don't play..."
Xander,Whatever happened to corporal punishment?
Sid,"Mm, mm, mm. Look at the goodies!"
Willow,"Morgan, you're really getting good! Where did you come up with  that voice?"
Morgan,It's kind of an imitation of my dad.
Buffy,Sounds real!
Sid,"It is real. I'm the one with the talent here. The kid's dead  weight. (to Willow) How about you and I do a little rehearsin' on our  own, honey?"
Xander,"Uh, hey!"
Sid,"You know what they say: once you go wood, nothin's as good!"
Buffy,"Okay, Morgan. We get the joke. Horny dummy, ha, ha, it's very  funny, but you might wanna consider getting some new schtick. Unless you  want your prop ending up as a Duraflame log."
Snyder,"Kids today need discipline. That's an unpopular word these  days, 'discipline'. I know Principal Flutie would have said, 'Kids need  understanding. Kids are human beings.' That's the kind of woolly-headed,  liberal thinking that leads to being eaten."
Giles,"I, I think perhaps it was a little more complex than, um..."
Snyder,"This place has quite a reputation. Suicide, missing persons,  spontaneous cheerleader combustion... You can't put up with that. You've  gotta keep an eye on the bad element."
Snyder,Like those three.
Snyder,"Kids. I don't like them. From now on you're gonna see a very  different Sunnydale High. Tight ship, clean, orderly, (faces Giles) and  quiet."
Giles,(clears his throat) It was Emily.
Willow,Emily. Dancer Emily?
Xander,"Oh, man! I hate this school."
Giles,"Uh, it must have happened just after, uh, dress rehearsals.  There was a cross-country meet at Melville. She, she, she never showed  up for it."
Buffy,Vampire?
Giles,"Um, I think not."
Buffy,"Giles, share! What happened?"
Giles,(exhales) Her heart was removed.
Willow,Yikes!
Buffy,Does that mean anything to you? Besides (shudders) ooooooo?
Giles,"Uh... (exhales) There are various demons which, which feed off  human hearts, but..."
Buffy,But demons have claws. And teeth.
Xander,They got no use for a big old knife.
Giles,Which more than likely makes our murderer...
Buffy,Human.
Xander,Did I mention that I *hate* this school?
Willow,So Emily was killed by a regular human person.
Giles,The evidence certainly points that way.
Buffy,"No, wait. I-I'm not buying, you guys. Remember the Hellmouth?  Mystical activity is totally rife here. This to me says demon."
Giles,"I'd like to think you're right. A demon is a creature of evil,  pure and very simple. A person driven to kill is, is, um, it's more  complex."
Willow,"The creep factor is also heightened. It could be anyone. It  could be me! (gets looks from them all) It's not, though."
Giles,"Uh, demon or no, we have some investigating to do. I suggest we  start with your... your talent show compatriots. One of them may have  been the last to see her alive."
Lisa,"I didn't know her too well. There's that whole dancer/band  rivalry, y'know?"
Buffy,I've heard about that.
Lisa,But I did speak to her a little the day that... yesterday.
Buffy,How did she seem?
Marc,"She was happy. I guess. She was psyched to be doing the show. She  was a really good dancer. Here, pick a card."
Giles,"Uh, um... (reaches for a card)"
Marc,"No, wai-wai-wai-wait. Not that one. Pick this one."
Giles,(takes the card) Do you remember the last time you saw her?
Marc,She was talkin' to someone.
Giles,Who?
Elliot,That smart guy. The one with the dummy. What's his name?
Willow,Morgan?
Elliot,"Yeah, that's it. He was actin' kinda strange."
Willow,Strange how?
Cordelia,"It's just such a tragedy for me. Emma was, like, my best  friend."
Xander,Emily.
Lisa,"Well, Morgan's just strange. He's always rubbing his head a lot  and moaning. Especially the other day."
Marc,He seemed kinda paranoid... Lookin' around at everyone...
Elliot,And I think I saw him arguing... with his dummy.
Cordelia,"All I can think is, it coulda been me!"
Xander,We can dream.
Sid,(to Morgan offstage) Right now you and me gotta be on the lookout.  Figure out who's gonna be next.
Morgan,"(comes on stage) How are we supposed to... (sees Buffy) Oh, hi."
Buffy,Hello.
Morgan,I was just working on throwing my voice. (walks upstage)
Buffy,"Uh, Morgan, did you notice anything weird going on around here  yesterday?"
Morgan,(gathers Sid up) Weird? What d'you mean? (goes down the steps  from the stage)
Buffy,"With Emily. Did she say anything to you, was she arguing with  anyone?"
Morgan,(goes over to Sid's case) No. She was dancing. (opens the case)  Sid and I were talking.
Buffy,Talking.
Morgan,Rehearsing.
Buffy,"So, you didn't notice anything weird at..."
Morgan,Ohhh!
Buffy,"Morgan, are you okay?"
Sid,"Look, sweetheart! He answered your question. Now leave him alone!"
Buffy,"Okay, Morgan, how 'bout talking to me yourself now?"
Sid,He said all he's gonna say.
Morgan,"It's okay, Sid. We're done. (puts Sid in his case)"
Buffy,"I'm sorry. Look, I didn't mean to make you mad."
Morgan,No! I'm... (quietly) It's him! (indicates Sid) He's... (closes  the case) We have to go. (grabs the case and leaves)
Buffy,(taken aback) Cute couple.
Xander,"Okay, next time we split up someone else is on Cordy detail.  Five more minutes with her and we woulda had another organ donor."
Willow,I think I had a bit more luck. Everyone I talked to seemed to  point their fingers at the same person.
Buffy,Morgan?
Willow,Morgan.
Xander,We have a winner!
Giles,I fear I was led to the same conclusion.
Xander,"Well, what do we do? We don't slay him, right? We wanna bring  him to justice."
Willow,We could set up a complex sting operation where we get him to  confess!
Xander,"Uh, I should wear a wire!"
Buffy,"Whoa, hey, you guys, all we know is that Morgan is a grade A  large weirdo. That doesn't lead directly to murderer."
Xander,Guy talks to his puppet!
Willow,And for his puppet.
Buffy,"Well, yeah, but what about the whole 'it's a demon' theory?"
Giles,"I'm looking into that, but, uh, my investigation is somewhat...  hampered by our life in the theater."
Buffy,"Uh, priority check, Giles? (weighs the two with her hands)  Talent show, murder."
Xander,"Yeah, we can't do the talent show, it's unthinkable. I'm not  able to think it!"
Giles,"Principal Snyder is watching us all very closely. Now, if he  chooses, he can make all our lives extremely difficult. A Slayer cannot  afford that! We will find this murderer, but in the meantime... the show  must go on."
Buffy,This is so unfair.
Giles,"Buffy, you, uh, watch Morgan. Check his locker, see if there's  anything there."
Willow,Like a heart?
Giles,Or something.
Buffy,Alright.
Willow,I'll pull up his locker number. (goes to the PC)
Xander,Can I still wear a wire?
Buffy,"Okay... Two to the left, three to the right..."
Buffy,Principal Snyder!
Snyder,What are you doing?
Buffy,"Uh, looking for something."
Snyder,"School hours are over. You, therefore, should be gone."
Buffy,And I'm going any minute now. (laughs nervously)
Snyder,"There are things I will not tolerate: students loitering on  campus after school, horrible murders with hearts being removed. And  also smoking."
Buffy,"Well, I don't do any of those things. Not... ever."
Snyder,(suspicious) There's something going on with you. I'll figure  it out sooner or later. (Buffy smiles) Do you need something here?
Buffy,"Oh! (looks into the locker) Yeah! Right! Um, a friend wanted me  to get something... out of his case!"
Buffy,He must've taken it and just forgotten to tell me.
Snyder,Mm-hmm.
Snyder,Get along home now. It's late.
Morgan,"No, I can't do it!"
Sid,It's the only way.
Morgan,I don't want...
Sid,She's the one.
Morgan,But...
Sid,"You saw what she did, how strong she is."
Morgan,"I know, but..."
Sid,"She's the last! Just this one more, and I'll be free."
Morgan,I won't.
Sid,I will!
Joyce,"Hi, hon. How's it, uh, going with the talent show?"
Buffy,It'll be over soon.
Joyce,"(lets out a laugh) It can't be that bad! I, for one, am looking  forward to seeing your act."
Buffy,Seeing? I-in the sense of actually attending?
Joyce,Of course!
Buffy,"Uh-uh! No, Mom, y-y-you can't! And, I mean, if I know you're  out there watching, I'll freeze up, stage fright."
Joyce,But I wanna support what you're doing!
Buffy,"Look, Mom, if you really love me, and wanna show your support,  you'll stay away. Far away."
Joyce,"Honey, is there, uh... Is there something bothering you? I-I  mean, besides your fabulous debut."
Buffy,Nothing. There's just a lot going on right now.
Joyce,Well. Get some sleep. You'll feel better in the morning.
Buffy,Good plan.
Joyce,"Honey, what is it?"
Buffy,"(comes over to her mom, frightened) In the bed, in the covers  there's something!"
Joyce,Where?
Buffy,There's something there.
Joyce,"Well, well, there, there's nothing there now. Are, are you sure  you didn't have a nightmare?"
Buffy,No! There's some... There is... (exhales and puts her hands on  her head) Yeah... You're probably right. (exhales and drops her hands)  I'm sorry I got you up.
Joyce,"Don't worry about it. I was dreaming about bills. (kisses  Buffy's forehead) Sweetheart, you shouldn't (points) go to sleep with  the window open."
Buffy,(confused) I didn't.
Marc,And my lovely assistant steps into the box...
Marc,And... behold!
Marc,You were supposed to leave!
Cordelia,I don't understand why I... why I have to follow Brett and  his stupid band.
Giles,Because we have to clear their equipment before the finale. I  told you.
Cordelia,"But the mood! It'll be all wrong! (gets in front of him and  stops him) My song is about dignity and human feelings and personal...  hygiene or something. Anyway, it's sappy, and no one is gonna be feeling  sappy after all that Rock and Roll."
Cordelia,"Uhhh, what?"
Giles,"Oh! I'm sorry. Um, your hair, uh..."
Cordelia,There's something wrong with my hair? (pulls it behind her  ears)
Cordelia,Ohmigod! (quickly leaves)
Giles,(to himself) Xander was right. It worked like a charm.
Giles,"Hello. You look a bit worse for, uh..."
Giles,What exactly are you the worse for?
Buffy,Where's Morgan? (sits)
Giles,"Uh, I, I... haven't seen him."
Xander,Did he do something to you?
Buffy,"No, it was his... Sid, the dummy."
Buffy,"Okay, everyone look at me like I'm in a bunny suit, 'cause  that's how stupid I feel saying this... I think Sid was in my room last  night."
Willow,With Morgan?
Buffy,No. He was alone. And alive.
Xander,Did you see him?
Buffy,"Well, I saw something. I-it ran across my floor, under my bed  and then it attacked me."
Giles,Attacked you? How?
Buffy,It was like it pounced on my face.
Xander,Like a cat.
Buffy,"Yeah, exactly! But when I turned the lights on it was already  gone. I-I think it went out my window."
Xander,Like a cat.
Buffy,"Yeah! No! It was Sid, the dummy."
Giles,Or possibly the nightmare of somebody who had... dummies on her  mind.
Willow,You did say they creep you out.
Buffy,"Excuse me? Can I have a *little* support here, please? I'm not  just some crazy person, I'm the Slayer."
Xander,The dummy Slayer? (gets a look from Buffy) There's nothing  funny about that.
Willow,"Well, on the side of the 'Morgan's just crazy' theory there is,  (sees Morgan go by carrying Sid) well, Morgan."
Buffy,I'd like to see Morgan without his better half for a few  minutes. Bet he could tell me something.
Giles,"Oh, uh, i-if it's any consolation, I... I may have found a  possible demon culprit. (holds up a book) The-there's a reference in  here to a brotherhood of seven demons who take, uh, the form of young  humans. Every seven years these demons need human organs, a-a-a brain  and a heart, to maintain their humanity. Otherwise they, they, they  revert back to their original form, which is, uh, uh, slightly less  appealing."
Willow,"So Morgan could still be the guy, only demon Morgan instead of  crazy Morgan."
Giles,"It's said that these demons are, are, are preternaturally  strong, and, and, and... Morgan is, is... Well, he seems to be getting  weaker every day."
Cordelia,Looks like someone digs you. That's adorable. You and the  dummy could tour in the freak show!
Morgan,"(looks at Sid, then up) What?"
Sid,Morgan has other things on his mind.
Morgan,I'll put him away.
Sid,(from inside the cupboard) I'm still watchin' you.
Morgan,Mrs. Jackson.
Morgan,You said you'd give me...
Morgan,"Yeah, it's great."
Morgan,Mm! (rubs his head in pain)
Morgan,(takes his hands down) Okay! Can I get Sid now?
Morgan,"Gone? Whadaya mean, gone? Where could he have gone?"
Morgan,He knew to wait for me. He knew I'd be back.
Morgan,What did you do with him? Where is he?
Buffy,Where did you get that?
Xander,"Oh, I, uh, took it out of Mrs. Jackson's cupboard. I thought  you said you wanted to be able to speak to Morgan alone, and uh... well,  Morgan's alone, and, uh... Sid's with me."
Xander,"(manipulating Sid) Hi, Buffy! Hi, Willow! Would you like to  hear some off-color jokes?"
Buffy,I really don't think you should be doing that.
Xander,What? C'mon... (as Sid) I'm not real!
Buffy,"(wigged) Xander, quit it!"
Xander,"He's... not... real! (picks Sid back up) I think our  demonstration proves that, uh, Sid (knocks on Sid's head several times)  is wood. Now, why don't you go and find Morgan and prove he's...  whatever he is?"
Giles,I imagine he's looking for his puppet.
Buffy,"I'll go find Morgan. (starts to leave, but stops and gives  Xander a look) You watch the dummy."
Xander,"(as Sid) Bye-bye, now. I'm completely inanimate."
Xander,(as Sid) Redrum! Redruuum!
Willow,What do we do with him?
Xander,"Eh, I'll keep him company."
Giles,"Willow, we have some hunting of our own to do."
Willow,Once again I'm banished to the demon section of the card  catalog.
Giles,"You concentrate on re-animation theory. I'll peck about in organ  harvesting. Unless, of course, you prefer..."
Willow,"That's okay, you can have the organs."
Xander,"So, I guess it's just... you and me, huh? (turns Sid's head  away and pats him) That looks more comfortable."
Buffy,Morgan?
Buffy,Morgan?
Buffy,Principal Snyder!
Snyder,Looking for something?
Buffy,Have you seen Morgan Shay?
Snyder,"(comes down the steps) You know, with everything that's been  going on recently, I'm not sure how safe it is for a girl like yourself  to be here... alone."
Buffy,"Well, I was just leaving. And I know how to take care of myself."
Snyder,"Alright, then."
Willow,"(to Giles) Look what I found in the section on toys and magic:  (reads) 'On rare occasions inanimate objects of human quality, such as  dolls and mannequins, already mystically possessed of consciousness,  have acted upon their desire to become human by harvesting organs.'"
Giles,Emily's heart.
Willow,Morgan's dummy.
Giles,Mm.
Xander,Whoa!
Giles,What is it?
Xander,He's gone! (indicates the chair) Sid's gone!
Giles,What? Oh!
Willow,Uhhh!
Buffy,Morgan?
Buffy,(whispers) Morgan! (slowly backs away) Demon's got himself a  brain.
Buffy,"Who's ever out there, I'm gonna hurt you! Badly! If you'll just  gimme a minute..."
Sid,You win. Now you can take your heart and your brain and move on.
Buffy,I'm sure they would have made great trophies for your case.
Sid,That woulda been justice.
Buffy,"Yeah, except for one thing: you lost, and now you'll never be  human."
Sid,"Yeah, well, neither will you."
Sid,"This is what I do. I hunt demons. Yeah, you wouldn't know it to  look at me. Let's just say there was me, there was a really mean demon,  there was a curse, and the next thing I know I'm not me anymore. I'm  sitting on some guy's knee, with his hand up my shirt."
Willow,And ever since then you've been a living dummy?
Sid,The kid here was right all along. I shoulda picked you to team up  with. But I didn't because...
Buffy,Because you thought *I* was the demon.
Sid,"Who can blame me for thinking? Look at you! You're strong,  athletic, limber... (goes off into his own world) nubile... (shakes his  head) I'm back! In any case, now that this demon's got the heart and  brain, he gets to keep the human form he's in for another seven years."
Giles,"I must say, it's a welcome change to have someone else explain  all these things."
Sid,"There were seven of these guys. I've killed six. If I can get the  last one, the curse will be lifted and I'll be free. I'm sure it's  someone in that stupid talent show."
Buffy,"Yeah, but now that demon has what he wants. He'll be moving on."
Sid,"So, once we know who's missing from the show..."
Buffy,We'll know who our demon is!
Giles,(remembering) The show!
Buffy,What?
Giles,It's gonna start! I'm supposed to be there!
Buffy,"(to Willow) Okay, um, start pulling everyone's addresses in the  talent show. I-if they're not there, maybe we can catch them at home."
Sid,"(to Giles) And you, get 'em all on stage, form the power circle.  Then we can see who's a no-show."
Giles,"Um, uh, the what?"
Sid,"The power circle. You get everyone together, you get 'em, you  know, revved up."
Giles,"Right. (still confused, but goes)"
Sid,How'd *he* ever get that gig?
Giles,"Fifteen minutes to curtain, everyone! Uh, fifteen minutes!"
Cordelia,"I, I can't go out there. All those people staring at me and  judging me like I'm some kind of... Buffy! What if I mess up?"
Giles,"Cordelia, there, uh, there-there's, uh, uh, an adage, uh, that,  uh, if you're feeling nervous then, uh, you should imagine the entire  audience are in their underwear."
Cordelia,Eww! Even Mrs. Franklin? Uhhh!
Giles,Perhaps not.
Cordelia,Yeah.
Giles,"(to everyone) Um, alright, um, we'll assemble on the stage in  five minutes for the, um, uh, power thing."
Sid,"So, what's your deal, kid? I don't figure you for a demon hunter."
Buffy,I'm a Vampire Slayer.
Sid,"(surprised) You?! You're the Slayer? (Buffy nods) Damn! I knew a  Slayer in the 30's. Korean chick. Very hot. We're talking *muscle* tone.  Man, we had some times. (gets a look from Buffy) Hey, that was pre- dummy, alright? Now, I was a guy!"
Buffy,"So, you kill the demon and the curse is lifted, right?"
Sid,That's the drill.
Buffy,"You don't actually turn into a prince, do you? I-I mean, your  body..."
Sid,Is dust and bones. When I say free...
Buffy,You mean dead.
Sid,"Don't get sniffly on me, sis. I've lived a lot longer than most  demon hunters. Or Slayers, for that matter."
Sid,"(puts his hand on her knee) Of course, if you want to snuggle up  and comfort me..."
Buffy,"(takes his hand off of her knee) So, that horny dummy thing  really *isn't* an act, is it?"
Sid,Nope!
Buffy,Yuk!
Giles,I-is everybody here?
Sid,"Okay, here comes our line-up."
Giles,"Quickly, everyone! Uh... um, power circle."
Giles,"Well, that's that, then. Um, everybody, uh, get ready!"
Buffy,(to Sid) Hold on.
Giles,No one's missing.
Buffy,So the demon isn't in the show.
Giles,"It seems not. Uh, tell the others. Look, it's nearly curtain. I  must get the show rolling."
Buffy,Right.
Giles,Right.
Buffy,Sid?
Buffy,Sid?
Buffy,I'm never gonna stop washing my hands.
Xander,"So, the dummy tells us that he's a demon hunter. And we're,  like, fine, la la la la. He takes off, and now there's a brain. Does  anybody else feel like they've been Keyser Soze'd?"
Buffy,"Sid's on the level, I'm sure of it. But why would the demon have  rejected the brain? I-I mean, I thought Morgan was the smartest kid in  school."
Willow,"He was, look at his grades: all A's. He was even taking college  classes. Wait a second."
Buffy,What?
Willow,All these sick days.
Xander,"He was off for, like, half the year!"
Buffy,Check the school nurse's file.
Willow,"(types) Look at this! 'In case of emergency, contact Dr. Dale  Leggett, California Institute of Neurosurgery, Cancer Ward.'"
Xander,Brain cancer?
Willow,That's why he had all the headaches.
Buffy,"This means that whatever's out there still needs a healthy,  intelligent brain."
Xander,"In other words, I'm safe! (smiles)"
Buffy,And it's gonna be looking for the smartest person around.
Willow,What?
Giles,"Yes, if you, you calibrated the units of weight then you could  calculate the, uh, specific maximum velocity achieved before the point  of impact."
Marc,"Gee, Mr. Giles, you're really... smart! Could you do me a favor?"
Willow,What could a demon possibly want from me?
Xander,What's the square root of 841?
Willow,"29. Oh, yeah."
Buffy,"Don't worry, Willow. As long as you're with us there's  absolutely no way that demon is gonna get what he wants."
Giles,"Oh, my!"
Marc,"Pretty cool, huh?"
Giles,Are you sure there's no one else who could help you out?
Marc,"My assistant got sick. You won't have to say anything. I'll, I'll  show you. Lie down."
Giles,"(inspects the guillotine) Uh, uh, how, how exactly does it work?"
Marc,A good magician never tells his secrets.
Marc,C'mon. We haven't got much time.
Buffy,This is ridiculous. We can't just sit here and wait for him to  come to us. We have to figure out who we're dealing with.
Xander,I still vote dummy.
Buffy,"No. Okay, so we ruled out all the people in the talent show..."
Willow,That's because they were all there. But that's before we found  the brain.
Buffy,"Right. So it probably *is* one of them. And, and Giles doesn't  know! He's with them all right now!"
Xander,"Uch! Giles can handle himself. I mean, he *is* really...  (clicks in his mind) smart!"
Buffy,GILES!
Giles,Sh-sh-shouldn't it be aimed at my neck?
Marc,"No. No, this way your scalp gets sliced off and your brains  just... come pouring out."
Giles,What exactly is the trick?
Marc,Trick? (pulls the chest restraint tighter)
Giles,Marc?
Giles,M-Marc?
Buffy,Ewww!
Willow,Where are the keys?
Giles,Marc's got it!
Xander,Willow!
Giles,Hurry!
Buffy,How do you lock this thing?
Giles,(yells) What's happening?
Sid,I found you!
Buffy,(to Xander) Let go!
Giles,"Uh... I must say, all of you... Your t-timing is impeccable."
Sid,And now for the big finish.
Buffy,What are you doing?
Sid,It's not enough. He'll come back. You have to get the heart. Then  all of this'll be over.
Buffy,Let me.
Sid,I got it. Thanks.
Buffy,(to Sid) It's over.
Snyder,I don't get it. What is it? Avant-garde?
Willow,"(stiff with fear) Oh, ruler of my country, Oedipus, you see our  company around the Altar, and I, the priest of Zeus!"
Xander,"(nervous) Ha, ha! They prophesize that I should kill my father.  But he is dead. (kneels down and gestures like he's grabbing a handful  of dirt) And hidden deep in the soil. But surely I must fear my mother's  bed."
Buffy,"(bored) (walks around Willow to Xander) Oh, Oedipus, Oedipus,  unhappy Oedipus, (briefly puts her hand on his head) that is all I can  call you, (goes back to her place) and all that I ever shall call you.  (faces away from the audience)"
Xander,"(gets back up) Darkness! And horror of darkness. Unfolding,  restless, visitant, sped by an ill wind in haste."
Xander,"Madness, and... Madness a-and stabbing pain, and, a-and, uh...  oh... oh... memory of, uh, i-ill deeds I have done."
