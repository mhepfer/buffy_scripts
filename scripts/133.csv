KENNEDY,"<br>    Flooring it. In the bag. 'Cause (pats the bed behind her) nice big comfy bed     right here. I mean, you ought to know. Your bed."
WILLOW,"<br>    (wide eyed and stiff, lying on her back) Yeah, but no. I'm OK. I just, I like     it down here. (pats the sleeping bag) It's firm."
KENNEDY,"<br>    (chuckles) Funny, you look a little uncomfortable. Or... is it just me?"
WILLOW,"<br>    No. I'm just, uh, uneasy 'cause Buffy's out."
KENNEDY,"<br>    Right. How many girls arriving this time?"
WILLOW,"<br>    Just one. But since Giles has the coven searching for other slayers-in-waiting     to send 'em our way, I bet we'll be seeing a lot more soon enough."
KENNEDY,"<br>    (moves the arm that was propping her head, flips her long brown hair, and     snuggles her face into her pillow, still looking at Willow) So, you're saying     I should enjoy having this bed all to myself as long as I can?"
WILLOW,"<br>    It is starting to get crowded around here."
KENNEDY,"<br>    (props her head on her hand again) Totally. And with this many girls, well,     I'm just saying if we don't get another bathroom in this house soon, things     are gonna get ugly."
WILLOW,"<br>    Sounds like somebody had to share mirror time with a bunch of siblings."
KENNEDY,"<br>    Somebody not me. I only got a half-sister and we didn't have to share. Her     bedroom was in another wing of the house."
WILLOW,"<br>    (staring) Wing? Your house had wings?"
KENNEDY,"<br>    Yeah. Just a couple. A few. Our summer home in the Hamptons didn't have any     at all. Well, one, actually."
WILLOW,"<br>    Huh. Well, that's&#151;that's ... huh."
KENNEDY,"<br>    But never mind my deal. What's your story, Willow, I mean, witchcraft? Wow,     that sounds new-agey."
WILLOW,"<br>    No, it's safe to say that what I practice is definitely old-agey."
KENNEDY,"<br>    (nods) So, show me a trick."
WILLOW,"<br>    A trick?"
KENNEDY,"<br>    You know, pull a rabbit out of something, or make something float."
WILLOW,"<br>    Uh, yeah, listen, Kennedy, um, it's almost morning. We really need to get     some sleep."

There's     a brunette Hispanic girl, a blonde girl with a southern accent, and a tall,     skinny red-head girl.</b>"
MOLLY,"<br>    Annabelle was all, &quot;Control your fear, control your fear.&quot; Meanwhile,     she's the one that goes scampering off, right into that Turok-Han vampire.     Poor Annie."
BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,"<br>    Great, so the slayer who's supposed to protect us let her get killed?"
MOLLY,"<br>    She didn't let her. Annabelle was foolish. Buffy can't be faulted by arriving     too late."
BRUNETTE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,"<br>    (sits up) It's not like she could've stopped it. I mean the super vampire     messed her up pretty good."
RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,"<br>    (sits up) No lie, she still looked like a big bruise when I got here, and     that was already like the day after."
BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,"<br>    And why isn't she back yet? Buffy. She left to get the new girl over an hour     ago. (Molly looks down contemplatively) Mabye she ran into trouble. (the red-head     slayer-in-training shrugs) You don't think she was too late again."
MOLLY,"<br>    Maybe&#151;"
XANDER,"<br>    (sleeping on a couch in the background) Maybe we can save the maybes for a     more dayish part of the day, girls. (turns on lamp) Potential slayers can     function without sleep. Me, I'm no good without my usual 90 minutes."
ANDREW,"<br>    (in the next room over, still tied to a chair, facing away from the group)     I'm with him. Keep the chatter down! Or, speak up so I can hear you. (to himself)     I'm bored. <u>Episode I</u> bored."
BUFFY,"<br>    You guys are all still up?"
XANDER,"<br>    (sits up, fakes a smile) Ah! Who needs sleep?"
BUFFY,"<br>    Everybody, this is Rona. (gestures to Rona)"
EVERYONE,"<br>    Hi. Hi, Rona."
ANDREW,"<br>    Hey, Rona."
XANDER,"<br>    (leans forward and smiles) Hey, Rona."
RONA,"<br>    (with her arms crossed, surveys the room, sees Andrew) Um... (to Buffy) why     is that guy tied to a chair?"
XANDER,"<br>    The question you'll soon be asking is, &quot;Why isn't he gagged?&quot; (smirks)"
GILES,"<br>    Molly, why don't you show our new houseguest where the kitchen is. I'm sure     she's hungry after her travels."
MOLLY,"<br>    (holding a bag of potato chips, stands) Fair enough. I'm a bit peckish meself.     (exits)"
RONA,"<br>    (to Anya) Bit what as well?"
ANYA,"<br>    That's English for &quot;hungry.&quot; (unrolls the sleeping bag and arranges     it on the floor)"
RONA,"<br>    (follows Molly, to herself) Oh, here I thought &quot;hungry&quot; was English     for &quot;hungry.&quot;"
GILES,"<br>    (to Buffy) Everything all right?"
BUFFY,"<br>    (helping Anya make a bed for Rona) She had a welcoming committee."
XANDER,"<br>    So, The First knows potential slayers are making their way here?"
GILES,"<br>    (leans forward on the back of a chair) I must warn the coven to be cautious."
BUFFY,"<br>    The First's always gonna be one step ahead of us, Giles. I need to know how     to stop it. No, not stop it, hurt it. I want to hurt it real bad. Tell me     how."
GILES,"<br>    I&#151;I don't know, Buffy. (takes off glasses, squats down to be on eye level     with everyone in the room) I've exhausted all the sources I have left with     little result. The Watcher's records are still really all we have to go on."
ANYA,"<br>    I made the rounds myself. Tried to dig up anything useful from the demon community."
XANDER,"<br>    They're a community now? What's next, the Ladies' Auxiliary?"
ANYA,"<br>    The ones that didn't attack me, didn't know anything or didn't talk. Either     way, we've got squat."
BUFFY,"<br>    Well, squat's not gonna cut it. What about the Turok-Han?"
XANDER,"<br>    The vampire time forgot?"
BUFFY,"<br>    Time may have forgotten him, but I sure won't. We know stakes don't kill it,     but anything in those ancient books about what does? Sunlight, fire, germs?"
ANDREW,"<br>    (from the other room) So, Giles, with that thing guarding the entrance to     The First's crib, how will Buffy get to Spike? (Giles's jaw drops, and he     seems perplexed)"
BUFFY,"<br>    I really hate to admit this, but he's not wrong. There's no way we'll be able     to help Spike until that thing is out of the way."
BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING,"<br>    Spike? Sorry, I'm confused. He's that vampire who's been killing people, right?     He's the one you're worried about helping?"
BUFFY,"<br>    (stammering) Well, we need him to&#151;he's the one that's been&#151;it's     complicated, Chloe."
BRUNETTE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING / CHLOE,"<br>    I'm Chloe, she's Eve."
BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING / EVE,"<br>    It's just, well, we've been talking, and do we have some kind of plan? You     know, any kind of plan to keep us from dying?"
BUFFY,"<br>    (stands, sighs) We're working on it."
GILES,"<br>    (stands, walks to Buffy) There is one avenue that we haven't tried yet&#151;"
ANYA,"<br>    (stands) Giles!"
GILES,"<br>    Beljoxa's Eye."
XANDER,"<br>    And exactly what part of town is that avenue in?"
ANYA,"<br>    (emphatically) I told you no."
BUFFY,"<br>    Wh-what is Botox's eye?"
GILES,"<br>    Beljoxa's Eye. It's an oracle type creature that exists in a dark dimension."
ANYA,"<br>    Internal vortex more like."
BUFFY,"<br>    Fun."
ANYA,"<br>    Not really, no."
GILES,"<br>    The point is, only demons can open the gateway to it."
ANYA,"<br>    (to Giles) Excuse me, ex-demon here."
GILES,"<br>    You're still friends in the fold. Murderous acquaintances, anyway."
ANYA,"<br>    (to Buffy) Look, there's no reason to think this Beljoxa's Eye will have any     of the answers we're looking for."
BUFFY,"<br>    I'll take anything I can get. Anya, please, we're running out of time. Spike's     running out of time."

ANYA,"<br>    Don't be so dramatic, Torg. You don't even have a heart. (laughs) Six spleens,     two stomachs, half a brain maybe, but no heart."
TORG,"<br>    Don't mock this. The night we spent together was...important to me."

It throws     her about 20 feet away, and she lands on the scaffolds, knocking the crossbow     out of Kennedy's hands. Buffy picks up the weapon and aims it at the Turok-Han     and fires as it runs toward her, hitting it right in the heart. It only pauses     for a moment, then comes at her again. </i>"

BUFFY,"<br>    See? Dust. Just like the rest of 'em. I don't know what's coming next, but     I do know it's gonna be just like this. Hard. Painful. But in the end it's     gonna be us. If we all do our parts, believe it, we'll be the ones left standing.     Here endeth the lesson."
