8EXT.CITY STREET IN ISTANBUL - NIGHT,</p><p><b>TITLE CARD: Istanbul</b>
"Turkish music plays. Camera shows the city skyline and closes in on the   top of a building, and then to the street. A dark-haired girl is running through   the arched hallway, looking over her shoulder and panting from the exertion   of running so fast. She slips down an embankment. She's being chased. A man   on the street sees her through his front door, and closes it rather than help   her. Two people in hooded cloaks are chasing her. After trying various alleys   looking for an escape route, she finds herself trapped in a dead-end. She sees   a drain pipe next to her and decides to use it to scale the building. The people   chasing her grab her foot, but she manages to escape their grip and easily climbs   up to the roof. There, another hooded figure is waiting and pushes her off the   building. She screams, but she lands on the ground alive, on her back. Two hooded   figures hold her down, and she fights back with all her might. A third figure   raises an arched, shiny, silver dagger and thrusts down at her.",</p><p><b>Cut to:</b>

BUFFY<br>,It's about power.
BUFFY,<br>  Who's got it. Who knows how to use it. So...
BUFFY,"<br>  Who's got the power, Dawn?"
DAWN,"<br>  (sighs) Well, I've got the stake."
BUFFY,<br>  The stake is not the power.
DAWN,<br>  But he's new. He doesn't know his strength. H-he might not know all those fancy   martial arts skills they inevitably seem to pick up.
BUFFY,<br>  Who's got the power?
DAWN,<br>  He does.
BUFFY,<br>  Never forget it. Doesn't matter how well prepped you are or how well armed you   are. You're a little girl.<br>
DAWN,<br>  Woman.
BUFFY,<br>  Little woman.
DAWN,<br>  I'm taller than you.
BUFFY,"<br>  He's a vampire, OK? Demon. Preternaturally strong. Skilled with powers no human   could possibly ever&#151;"
VAMPIRE,<br>  Excuse me. I think I'm stuck.
BUFFY,<br>  You're stuck?
VAMPIRE,"<br>  My foot's caught on a root or something, and... I don't even know how I got   down there. If you girls could just give me a hand..."
DAWN,"<br>  Hm. So, he's got the power?"
BUFFY,<br>  Zip it.
VAMPIRE,"<br>  I really appreciate it. It's just it's so dark, and I don't even know what I'm   doing here."
VAMPIRE,<br>  Whoa. Ooh. Thanks. That was a help. Unfortunately it was the last&#151;
VAMPIRE,<br>  &#151;thing you'll ever do.
BUFFY,<br>  Listen up. I'm the slayer. You don't want to get into it with me. You want blood?   You can have hers.
BUFFY,"<br>  Power. He's got it. He's going to use it. You don't have it, so &#151;"
BUFFY,<br>  &#151;use that. Perfect.
DAWN,<br>  Buffy!
BUFFY,"<br>  It's real. It's the only lesson, Dawn. It's always real. Let me see."
DAWN,"<br>  It's nothing, it's just a scrape. Plus, I had a plan the whole time."
BUFFY,<br>  Really?
DAWN,"<br>  Yeah, I planned to get killed, come back as a vampire, and bite you."
BUFFY,<br>  You wanted to be trained.
DAWN,"<br>  Well, just the next time when you're gonna disa&#151;"
BUFFY,<br>  You did pretty well.
DAWN,<br>  I did?
BUFFY,<br>  Yeah.
DAWN,"<br>  'Cause, you know, with the whole rolling thing, I was actually using his strength,   and it was very tai chi. Plus I nearly got the heart."
BUFFY,"<br>  My first time out, I missed the heart too."
DAWN,<br>  No way.
BUFFY,<br>  Just the once.
DAWN,"<br>  Well, the next vampire I meet&#151;"
BUFFY,"<br>  The next vampire you meet, you run away. I just wish that was all we had to   worry about. Vampires, demons... they're nothing compared to what's coming."
DAWN,<br>  I know. I just can't believe it's back.
BUFFY,"<br>  Believe me, I thought I was long past it. I guess you never are. Just a few   more days 'til it starts. Then we'll never know what's coming next."

Giles is riding a horse through the English countryside. Then we see him   walking through a field to a tree that Willow is sitting under. She is looking   at the ground making an exotic flower grow and bloom.,</p><p><b>GILES<br>  </b>That doesn't belong there.
WILLOW,"<br>  No, it doesn't."
GILES,"<br>  That's the flora kua alaya. A native of Paraguay, if my botany serves."
WILLOW,<br>  Is there anything you don't know everything about?
GILES,<br>  Synchronized swimming. Complete mystery to me.
GILES,<br>  Yep. Paraguay. Where does it come from?
WILLOW,<br>  Paraguay.
GILES,<br>  Who brought it through the Earth?
WILLOW,"<br>  It's all connected. The root systems, the molecules...the energy. Everything's   connected."
GILES,<br>  You sound like Miss Hartness.
WILLOW,<br>  She's taught me a lot.
GILES,<br>  Then why aren't you in your lesson?
WILLOW,<br>  Sorry.
GILES,<br>  It's alright. She was just&#151;
WILLOW,"<br>  &#151;afraid. Yeah, they all are. The coven is&#151;they're the most amazing women   I've ever met. But there's this look that they get. Like I'm gonna turn them   all into bangers and mash, or something. Which I'm not even really sure what   that is."
GILES,<br>  They're cautious. I trust you understand that.
WILLOW,"<br>  I don't have that much power, I don't think."
GILES,"<br>  Everything's connected. You're connected to a great power, whether you feel   it or not."
WILLOW,<br>  Well you should just take it from me.
GILES,"<br>  You know we can't. This isn't a hobby or an addiction. It's inside you now,   this magic. You're responsible for it."
WILLOW,<br>  Will they always be afraid of me?
GILES,<br>  Maybe. Can you handle it?
WILLOW,"<br>  I deserve a lot worse. I killed people, Giles."
GILES,<br>  I've not forgotten.
WILLOW,"<br>  When you brought me here, I thought it was to kill me or to lock me in some   mystical dungeon for all eternity or&#151;with the torture. Instead, you go all   Dumbledore on me. I'm learning about magic. All about energy and Gaia and root   systems."
GILES,<br>  Do you want to be punished?
WILLOW,<br>  I wanna be Willow.

DAWN (O.S.),<br>  Just a minute.
BUFFY,<br>  You're going to be late.
DAWN (O.S.),<br>  I'm comfortable with that.
XANDER,<br>  G'morning!
BUFFY,"<br>  (to Dawn) Well, you gotta eat something. I made cereal."
DAWN (O.S.),<br>  OK.
BUFFY,<br>  (to Xander) You're unconscionably spiffy.
XANDER,<br>  Client meeting. How exactly do you make cereal?
BUFFY,"<br>  Ah, you put the box near the milk. I saw it on the food channel. Want something?"
XANDER,<br>  I ate. I'm good. How are you?
BUFFY,"<br>  My sister's about to go to the same high school that tried to kill me for three   years. I can't change districts, I can't afford private school, and I can't   begin to prepare for what could possibly come out of there. So, peachy with   a side of keen, that would be me."
XANDER,<br>  Well here's a little something for what ails ya.
BUFFY,<br>  Mmm. You got the rest.
XANDER,<br>  Take a look.
DAWN,<br>  Hey. Check out double-O Xander.
BUFFY,<br>  Go. Talk with your mouth full.
XANDER,"<br>  I've got two crews working on this diabolical yet lucrative new campus. One   here finishing the Science building. And one here, reinforcing the Gym. There   are no pentagrams, no secret passageways. Everything's up to code and safe as   houses."
BUFFY,<br>  Nothing creepy? Strange? From beyond?
DAWN,<br>  (with her mouth full) Maybe you're just paranoid.
XANDER,"<br>  Well, there is one interesting detail. I managed to scare up the plan from   the old high school. You remember the very center of Sunnydale's own hell mouth?"
BUFFY,<br>  Under the library.
XANDER,"<br>  Right. So I lined up the plans, new and old. And right exactly where the library   was, we now have..."
BUFFY,<br>  Principal's office.
DAWN,<br>  So the principal's evil?
BUFFY,<br>  Or in a boatload of danger.
XANDER,<br>  Well the last two principals were eaten. Who would even apply for that job?
BUFFY,"<br>  Guess we'll see. Ooh, we have to leave though. You have everything? Books,   lunch, stakes?"
DAWN,<br>  Checked thrice.
XANDER,<br>  (whispering to Buffy) Did you give her the...

DAWN,"<br>  Hey, Buffy, I think it's pretty safe to say I'm not going to see anybody that's   invisible."
BUFFY,"<br>  You know, you could still drop out. Only nerds finish high school."
DAWN,"<br>  You know, I don't really think it's fair for you to try and scare me on my   first day of high school. 'Cause it is so redundant."

DAWN,"<br>  Wait, you came downstairs? Where?"
CARLOS,"<br>  Man, I got no clue. I ran away like a girl. I don't know this place at all."
DAWN,"<br>  OK, so we can run around in circles, or..."
DEAD JANITOR,<br>  Do you really think you can run away?
KIT,<br>  It's not real.
DAWN,<br>  Lesson one: it's always real.
DEAD NERD,<br>  I tried to run too.
DEAD GIRL,"<br>  I tried to scream. Doesn't matter how much you scream, nobody ever hears you."
DAWN,<br>  Hear me. Right. Ooh. I got a present.
KIT,<br>  What is it?
DAWN,<br>  A weapon.

PRINCIPAL,"<br>  Oh, my God!"
BUFFY,"<br>  Uh, no, I'll be right there."

DEAD JANITOR,"<br>  Too late. But then, you're always too late, aren't you? Sure as hell didn't   save me."
BUFFY,<br>  Where's my sister?
DEAD JANITOR,<br>  I think she's lost.
BUFFY,"<br>  If I'm the one who let you die, why take it out on her? I'm right here. C'mon,   what're you after? Fear? Revenge? Tasty brains?"
DEAD NERD,<br>  I think I'd like Dawn to be my girlfriend.
BUFFY,"<br>  Again, wrong sister. I'm the one that dates dead guys. And, no offense, but   they were hotties. I mean, I'm sure you had a great personality, but..."

BUFFY,"<br>  Hello! Not making myself clear. I don't care how you died. I'm sorry for your   loss, but where is my sister? Dawn!"
DEAD JANITOR,<br>  She's not gonna hear you. This place is like a maze.
DEAD GIRL,<br>  This place is ours now. It was built on our graves.
DEAD JANITOR,<br>  All we want is for you to leave so we can rest again.
BUFFY,"<br>  Actually, I'm thinking all you want is to get between me and that door. Who's   for finding out why."

BUFFY,<br>  He'll probably show up in a sec.
SPIKE,<br>  Nobody comes in here. It's just the three of us.
BUFFY,"<br>  Spike, have you seen Dawn? She came down here with some kids."
SPIKE,<br>  (Yelling) Don't you think I'm trying? I'm not fast. I'm not a quick study.   (Suddenly crying) I droped my board in the water and the chalk all ran. Sure   to be caned. (Laughs) Should've seen that coming.

BUFFY,"<br>  So far, to piss me off."
DAWN,"<br>  Please, tell me it's working."
BUFFY,"<br>  Oh, I'm damage-bound. I just can't figure them. Ghosts can't touch you and   zombies can't disappear, so I don't know what&#151;"
SPIKE,<br>  Not ghosts.
DAWN,<br>  Who was that?
BUFFY,<br>  (To the phone) Hold on. (To Spike) You know what they are?
SPIKE,"<br>  Manifest spirits controlled by a talisman, raised to seek vengeance. A 4-year-old   could figure it."
BUFFY,"<br>  (To the phone) Hang tight. I'll find you. These things can hurt you. You can   hurt them too. Find a weapon. I'll come for you. (To Spike) Spike, you gonna   help me out?"
