GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
MONK,We had to hide the key ... made it human...
MONK,...and sent it to you.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,Dawn.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,Tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
QUENTIN TRAVERS VOICEOVER,"Glory isn't a demon, she's a god."
GLORY,"Did you know your sister took my key, Dawnie, and she won't give it back. I bet you know where she put it, don't you?"
SPIKE,"(reading) They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the key to her, in the form of a sister."
BEN,"You're the key. Go. Before she finds you, she's here!"
SPIKE,I love you.
BUFFY,The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
BUFFY,Let's see what you are.
BUFFY,Or who you are.
ORLANDO,One soldier in a vast army.
KNIGHTS,The key is the link. The link must be severed.
GLORY,Where ... is ... the key?
ORLANDO,I'd die a thousand deaths before I'd tell you.
WILLOW,No!
WILLOW,Tara! No!
WILLOW,"Tara, I'm so sorry."
BUFFY,What are you gonna need?
WILLOW,They gave me a lot of stuff to keep her calm.
GLORY,I told you this wasn't over.
TARA,"(gasping, staring at Dawn) Oh, look at that, look at that. Such pure green energy!"
DAWN,Buffy!
BUFFY,We have to keep moving!
DAWN,I can't!
GLORY,I really hate it when people touch my things.
GLORY,"Last words, slay-runt?"
BUFFY,"Just one. Truck.Glory looks to her right, too late, as a huge semi smashes into her."
GLORY,"No! Not now, you idiot! Let go-"
BEN,-of my body!
BEN,"Oh, god."
DAWN,"A-and then whoosh! All of a sudden Glory's standing right there in front of us, (we see Giles standing listening, and Buffy peering out through the closed window blinds) all skanky and blonde and thinkin' she's all that (shot of Xander and Anya sitting, listening) just 'cause some bumpy heads kiss her stinky feet ... (pauses, very quietly) She does have nice feet. (louder) A-and she's comin' right at us, and- (shot of the whole room. Willow and Tara sitting on the sofa) Buffy's just standing there not even blinking, like ""Bring it on,"" and then, wham! (smacks one fist into the other hand) Hell-bitch in orbit."
XANDER,"Go, Buff!"
GILES,"I knew you'd best Glory eventually, I mean all-all our years of training-"
BUFFY,(still staring out the window) A truck hit her.
GILES,Oh.
ANYA,You threw it at her?
DAWN,"Well, no. She more kind of waited for it to hit Glory. Uh, but then Buffy ran really fast and we got away. (Shot of Willow and Tara on the sofa. Tara still stares blankly at Dawn.)"
BUFFY,I don't know how we got away. That truck couldn't have slowed her down for more than a second.
GILES,"Well, how isn't important, all that matters is that the two of you are safe."
BUFFY,Safe? (angrily) We've barely been able to manage not getting seriously dead every time we've crossed paths with Glory. Now that she knows that Dawn is the key?
GILES,"There must be something in the <I>Book of Tarnis</I> that we've missed, something we can use against Glory."
ANYA,Piano!
XANDER,Because that's what we used to kill that big demon that one time!
XANDER,"No wait, that-that was a rocket launcher. (turns to Anya) Ahn, what are you talking about?"
ANYA,"We should drop a piano on her. Well, it always works for that creepy cartoon rabbit when he's running from that nice man with the speech impediment."
GILES,"(rolls his eyes) Yes, or perhaps we could paint a convincing tunnel on the side of a mountain. Let's just keep thinking, everyone. (to Buffy) Perhaps we should reassemble at the magic shop, see if there's anything-"
BUFFY,We can't fight her.
GILES,"(surprised) W-well not yet, no, but-"
BUFFY,"No, not ever. She's too strong, Giles. We're not gonna win this with, with stakes, or spells, or pulling out some uranium power core. She's a god and she's coming for us. So let's just not be here when she starts knocking."
ANYA,Run away?
ANYA,"Finally, a sensible plan."
XANDER,That's not what she meant. (to Buffy) Is it?
BUFFY,"Well, we can't stay here! She'll just kill us off one by one until there's no one left standing between her and Dawn."
GILES,"Buffy, we all understand the severity of the situation, but there must be another way."
BUFFY,"(harshly) No. We stay, we die. Show of hands for that option."
BUFFY,"All right. Nobody goes home, nobody tells anybody we're leaving. Just pack up whatever supplies we need and that's it, we're gone."
DAWN,(quietly) Cool. Don't have to study for that geometry test.
XANDER,(quietly) What about wheels? I don't think everybody's gonna fit in the Xandermobile.
BUFFY,Just get your stuff together. I'll handle the rest.
Cut to,"Glory's apartment. Ben comes down the stairs to the main room, wearing regular clothes, followed by a minion, Gronx. Gronx holds Glory's dress and speaks with a female voice (although she looks just like the others)."
GRONX,"This is, this is terrible. I'll never be able to mend this."
BEN,Not really my color anyway. (sits on the arm of a sofa)
GRONX,"Oh, yes. Inappropriate humor. (fake laugh) Most amusing. Don't suppose you know what led to this sartorial tragedy."
BEN,"That's not how it works, you know that."
GRONX,"Yes, of course. I just thought maybe after her magnificent incandescence was returned to this ... manly and ... (looking Ben up and down) painfully handsome assemblage ... you might have noticed something interesting? A key in human form, perhaps? Lounging about unattended?"
BEN,"If I did, do you really think I would tell you?"
GRONX,Why do you insist on fighting the inevitable? No one can stand against her blindingly scrumptious luminescence.
BEN,"Glory. Her name is Glory, and she's your god, you little scab, not mine."
GRONX,"With all due respect and-and fear of sharp objects, you exist, sir, only because of her divine greatness."
BEN,"You mean her divine failure, don't you?"
BEN,I didn't ask for any of this. I just want to be normal.
GRONX,We play the hand we're dealt.
BEN,"Nothing's mine, is it? This life, this body, it's all infected. The only thing I ever cared about she's taken away from me. You know why I wanted to be a doctor?"
GRONX,Flattering drawstring pants?
BEN,"To be close to people. To witness their lives and their deaths, to be there alongside them, a part of everyday humanity. (sighs) Maybe it's the drugs. (walks past)"
GRONX,"Drugs, sir? (follows him)"
BEN,"Find the right combination, keep her buried where she belongs."
GRONX,"Impossible! Her magnificence can never be fully contained! She is a perfect, all-encompassing light, one you should feel honored to be bathed in."
BEN,"Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled. Especially with the part where she gets her key back and I cease to exist."
GRONX,"True, this oh-so-appealing form will of necessity be shrugged off."
BEN,Not if I get the key first. (turns to leave but Gronx stops him)
GRONX,"And if you did ... what then? Could you do it? (Ben looks annoyed) Take a human life with your own hands? (comfortingly) Oblivion is such a small inconvenience in the service of a deity. Accept your fate. I mean, you said it yourself. This life was never really yours anyway, was it?"
BEN,It doesn't matter how I came by it. It's mine. And I plan on keeping it.
Cut to,"city street, day. Willow and Tara sit on a bench while Giles, Anya, and Xander stand. They all have bags of stuff and are watching the cars go by."
ANYA,Anybody else feel that?
WILLOW,What?
ANYA,Cold draft of paralyzing fear.
GILES,We just need to stay calm.
WILLOW,"(skeptical) Calm, right."
XANDER,"Hey, we gotta be like Sergeant Rock. Cool and collected in the face of overwhelming odds."
ANYA,*Over*whelming? (turns to him) How much more than whelming would that be exactly?
GILES,"Look, everything will be all right, we just need to stay here calmly. As soon as Buffy arrives-"
GILES,-we'll feel oddly worse.
GILES,(grimly) What's he doing here?
SPIKE,Just out for a jaunt. Thought I'd swing by and say howdy.
GILES,Out.
BUFFY,(looks up from the table) He's here because we need him.
XANDER,The hell we do.
BUFFY,"If Glory finds us, he's the only one besides me that has any chance of protecting Dawn."
XANDER,"Buffy, come on-"
BUFFY,"(jumps up angrily) Look, this isn't a discussion! He stays. Get over it."
SPIKE,"Buckle up, kids. Daddy's puttin' the hammer down."
Cut to,interior hospital. A nurse hands a clipboard and pen to a guy wearing a baseball cap.
NURSE,Sign here.
Shot of the paper on the clipboard. The guy signs,"first name Dante, last name illegible."
NURSE,"Okay, that should do it."
DANTE,(to the other man) See. Did I not tell you how easy it would be for us to-
NURSE,Hey!
NURSE,(pointing at Dante's hand) My pen.
ORLANDO,The trees are singing water.
GREGOR,You have him.
DANTE,"Yes, General."
DANTE,Our brother has returned to the fold.
GREGOR,"Welcome home, Orlando. (puts his hand on Orlando's shoulder) I swear by my sword your sacrifice ... will not go unavenged."
ORLANDO,Shiny.
GREGOR,"Yes, I suppose it is."
ORLANDO,"Pretty little girl, she's shiny too."
GREGOR,"(to Dante) Watch him, make sure he's comfortable."
ORLANDO,So shiny. Pretty little shiny key.
GREGOR,The key? You've seen it?
ORLANDO,Pretty ... little shiny girl.
GREGOR,"The monks, they've made it human."
DANTE,We know the Slayer's protecting the key. If what Orlando says is true...
GREGOR,Prepare to advance!
KNIGHT,Yes sir.
GREGOR,(turns back) We end this now.
ANYA,"Shouldn't somebody be asking, ""Are we there yet?"""
ANYA,(to Xander) Isn't that what small entertaining children do?
DAWN,That kinda only works if you know where you're going.
ANYA,(calls to Giles) Do we know where we're going yet?
SPIKE,We'd already be somewhere if Captain Slowpoke would give up the wheel. (Giles looks annoyed) Hey! Gramps! Bloody step on it!
GILES,Step on what? I've driven tricycles with more power.
XANDER,(groans) Is anybody else queasy?
ANYA,(rubs his arm sympathetically) He doesn't travel well. He's like fine shrimp.
SPIKE,"(to Dawn) I shoulda nicked that Porsche I had my eye on. There's just enough room for me, you, and big sis."
SPIKE,What?
XANDER,"Would you give it a rest, or..."
SPIKE,"Or what, you're gonna toss your cookies on my shoes?"
XANDER,Or you can be undead man walking. See how fast you can hitch a ride with a flaming (gulps) thumb.
SPIKE,Fine. (quietly) Shrimp.
XANDER,That guy is bloodsuckin' the last nerve right outta me.
GILES,"Well, Buffy has a point. In a confrontation, Spike may prove..."
GILES,...useful.
XANDER,"(still queasy) I don't know if Buffy's thinkin' too clear on that one, or anything else right now. (gulps) I've never seen her so..."
GILES,"She's ... been through more than her fair share of late. She just needs a chance to catch her breath, regroup. She'll be all right."
XANDER,Yeah. She'll ... (gulps) Yeah.
DAWN,Any luck?
WILLOW,"Uh, if you define luck as the absence of success, plenty. (shot of Anya and Spike listening) There's a couple barrier spells, but... (we see Tara next to Willow, staring past her at Dawn) they only work on a fixed locus. Haven't found anything that'll work while we're still moving."
TARA,"So pretty, can I have one?"
WILLOW,(to Tara) Come on. (pushes Tara back into her seat)
DAWN,Anyone hungry?
ANYA,Ooh! Snacks! The secret to any successful migration.
ANYA,Who's up for some tasty fried meat products?
SPIKE,Hey! Aah!
WILLOW,"Tara, no! What did I tell you?"
WILLOW,Shh.
WILLOW,"I'm sorry. She, she didn't mean to."
WILLOW,She doesn't know what she's doing. (Tara continues whimpering)
DAWN,We know.
SPIKE,"No biggie. Look, the skin's already stopped smoking. You go ahead and play ... peek-a-boo with Mister Sunshine all you like. It keeps the ride from getting boring."
TARA,(upset) All the light is gone. (crying)
WILLOW,"No, shh, baby. The light's still outside, okay?"
TARA,All dark. All dark.
GRONX,"It's coming. The signs are in alignment, and soon victory will be in our grasp. (they smile) All we need do is seize the moment ... and squeeze until it bleeds."
DAWN,Hey. I think Anya's gonna try to cook. Wanna come watch the tears and recriminations?
BUFFY,(small smile) Maybe later.
DAWN,Thanks.
BUFFY,(looks up) For what?
DAWN,You know. Pretty much everything.
BUFFY,(sarcastic) Yeah. I'm doin' a great job.
DAWN,(firmly) You are.
BUFFY,(scoffs) I'm the Slayer. The chosen one. All mythic and defender-y. Evil nasties are supposed to flee from me. Not the other way around.
DAWN,You're not fleeing. You're ... moving at a brisk pace.
BUFFY,Quaintly referred to in some cultures as the big scaredy runaway.
DAWN,It's the most amazing thing anyone's ever done for me.
BUFFY,(voice breaking) It just keeps coming. Glory ... Riley ... Tara ... Mom.
DAWN,(pause) I know. But there's a bright side.
BUFFY,There is?
DAWN,At least things can't get any crazier. Right?
BUFFY,You know this is your fault for saying that.
KNIGHT,Come on now!
KNIGHT,Bring up the rear! Let's go!
BUFFY,Giles!
GILES,I see them.
SPIKE,See who?
XANDER,Arrows!
SPIKE,Bloody hell!
XANDER,They're throwing arrows!
BUFFY,"Dawn, get down under the table."
TARA,(peeking out) Horsies!
WILLOW,Tara!
GILES,Weapons?
SPIKE,Hello! You're driving one!
WILLOW,Don't hit the horsies!
BUFFY,"Oh, we won't!"
BUFFY,Aim for the horsies.
XANDER,Did we shake 'em?
BUFFY,Stay low!
BUFFY,Watch out for the-
SPIKE,Now might be a good time for something heroic.
BUFFY,Xander! Hatch!
DAWN,Keep the pressure on.
SPIKE,"I always do, sweet bit."
ANYA,"Not a piano, but hey."
GILES,Everyone all right?
XANDER VOICEOVER,We gotta find shelter.
SPIKE VOICEOVER,"Yeah, right bloody quick. I'm burning up out here."
Cut to,overhead shot of an abandoned gas station with a rusting old truck in front of it. The gang walks up to the building.
BUFFY,Careful.
BUFFY,Spike.
XANDER,Careful. Up.
BUFFY,"Okay, Will?"
WILLOW,I'm on it.
WILLOW,"Oh, careful!"
BUFFY,Are you sure you're okay?
DAWN,Yeah. B-but Spike's hurt.
SPIKE,Ow! Easy with the delicates.
BUFFY,(to Dawn) They'll heal.
SPIKE,Florence bloody Nightingale to the rescue.
Buffy goes to the window and looks through the boards. Shot of the view outside,no one in sight.
ANYA,"Um, you have another plan, right? (Buffy turns from the window to look at her) One that doesn't involve pointy knives and a Winnebago?"
BUFFY,"We-we-we'll rest here for a minute, but then we have to keep moving."
XANDER,Where?
BUFFY,"(desperately) I don't know! (puts her hands to her face) We just, we, we, we can't, can't stay here. I-it's too close to the wreck, we're too easy to find."
WILLOW,Buffy!
BUFFY,"Will, how is he?"
BUFFY,Will?
WILLOW,"I-I think I slowed the bleeding, but..."
BUFFY,"Okay. Okay, just-just give me a minute."
BUFFY,"Dawn, get down!"
XANDER,(OS) We got company.
XANDER,And they brought a crusade.
BUFFY,Willow!
WILLOW,I'm working on it!
KNIGHTS,"Go! Go! Go! Let's move! Come on, move it!"
DAWN,Buffy!
KNIGHT,It's clear! (?)
GREGOR,The key.
WILLOW,"Enemies, fly and fall."
WILLOW,"Circling arms, raise a wall."
DANTE,(angry growl) They have the general. Clerics!
CLERIC,Energy barrier. A most powerful one.
DANTE,Can it be breached?
CLERIC,The witch's magic pales to the might of our god. The infidels' wall ... shall tumble before us.
BUFFY,Will? How long will it hold?
WILLOW,(uncertain) Half a day maybe.
WILLOW,Or till Heckle and Jeckle punch a hole through it.
SPIKE,So. What's the story with these role-playing rejects?
BUFFY,(OS) Let's find out.
SPIKE,You sure Scarface here can habla the English?
BUFFY,He understands me. (to Gregor) Don't you?
GREGOR,"You were warned we would return, Slayer."
BUFFY,"Took you long enough. What are you supposed to be, some kind of chief?"
GREGOR,(sneers) General.
BUFFY,"General. (takes a step forward) In charge of what, getting captured?"
GREGOR,"You do not frighten me, child. (looks at Dawn) The instrument of chaos must be destroyed."
BUFFY,"(angrily) Look at her that way again, and she will be the last thing you ever see."
GREGOR,"As I've been told, you protect the key of the beast."
BUFFY,It's not that simple.
GREGOR,"Yes. The key has been transformed, given ... breath, life. Yet, this makes no difference. The key is the link. The link must be severed. (Shot of Dawn looking scared) Such is the will of god."
BUFFY,"(upset) She doesn't remember anything about being this key you're all looking for. The only thing that she remembers is growing up with a mother, and a sister that love her. What kind of god would demand her life for something that she has no control over?"
BUFFY,We are not your enemy. (Shot of Spike watching) Tell your men to stand down.
GREGOR,(looks at Dawn) No.
BUFFY,It is not her fault! She's human now! (Shot of Dawn)
GREGOR,The key is too dangerous ... to be allowed to exist. No matter what form it has been pressed into.
BUFFY,I will not let anyone tell me-
WILLOW,"Shh, shh, shh."
BUFFY,What happened?
ANYA,"I-I don't know, she just went nuts."
TARA,"Time! Time, time!"
WILLOW,"Tara! (to Buffy) We have to do something! (shot of Dawn and Spike watching with concern) She, she can't stay this way. Buffy!"
TARA,Time... time... time...
PATIENTS,Time. Time.
NURSE,"No, it's not time for your meds, just lie back-"
NURSE,(yelling over her shoulder) Doctor! Doctor McCarthy!
ORLANDO,It's time. It's time.
DANTE,"No, no, shh. There's nothing to fear, my brother."
DANTE,"The beast may have taken your mind, but I swear to you, she will never know the taste of your heart."
DANTE,Clerics! (The clerics turn) I want the witch's barrier down. NOW!
Cut to,closeup of Buffy's face.
BUFFY,I'm sorry.
GILES,For what?
BUFFY,"We should have stayed. If we had, none of this would have happened."
GILES,Don't. (painfully) What you did ... w-was necessary ... what I've always admired.
BUFFY,(small smile) Running away?
GILES,Being able to place ... your heart ... above all else.
GILES,I'm so proud of you. You've come so far. You're everything a Watcher ... everything I could have hoped for.
BUFFY,Willow.
BUFFY,Open a door.
DANTE,Speak.
BUFFY,One of my friends was hurt when you attacked us.
DANTE,And ten of my men are dead. Honorable men. (draws his sword) Shall we balance the scale?
BUFFY,Will you let someone come and help him or not?
DANTE,Give quarter to an agent of the beast? What madness would move me to such action?
BUFFY,I'm done asking.
XANDER,"Whoa, whoa, hey! Uh ... this is war, isn't it? And if there's one thing I've learned from Sergeant Rock, it is in war ... there are rules."
XANDER,"Or at least there should be, if you're as honorable as you think you are. (Buffy looks to see if Dante is convinced) Plus, we do have your general forehead guy."
Cut to,"Willow, Spike, and Buffy standing beside a pay phone in the building. The phone is dark."
WILLOW,Discharge and bring life.
SPIKE,"(to Willow) Handier than a Swiss knife. Look, the door to my crypt's got this nasty squeak, maybe you could..."
BUFFY,"Hey, uh, i-it's Buffy. I need to ask you a really big favor."
Cut to,"exterior shot, night. A car drives up to the gas station where the army of knights stands around watching. Ben is at the wheel. He stops the car and looks fearfully out the window at the knights, who all hold weapons and glare at him. Ben takes a deep breath, picks up his black bag from the seat, and gets out of the car."
BEN,"You, uh, forgot to mention the costume party outside."
BUFFY,Sorry. (shot of Willow sitting over a sleeping Tara) I-I didn't know who else to call.
BEN,"No, it's okay. I mean, yeah, not ... how I pictured seeing you again, but, uh ... I'll take what I can get."
BUFFY,Thank you ... for coming.
BEN,My pleasure.
BEN,"All right, I think I got him stabilized, but there's a lot of damage. We need to get him out of here."
BUFFY,"Well, I think the guys with the pointy swords kinda have other ideas."
BEN,Don't they always.
BUFFY,"Look, I know this must seem extra ""Outer Limits"" to you."
BEN,This? Naah. I've seen things you wouldn't believe.
BEN,"(OS) You know, emergency room, full moon on a Saturday night."
BUFFY,"Look, if this gets too weird, just tell me. I'll understand."
BEN,Don't worry about me. I won't leave until I've worn out my welcome.
SPIKE,(whispering) Ow.
SPIKE,Thanks.
XANDER,"You know, those things'll kill you."
XANDER,Oh. Right.
XANDER,I mention today how much I don't like you?
SPIKE,(nods) You mighta let it slip in ... (looks at Xander) once or twice.
XANDER,How're your feelers?
SPIKE,"(sighs, looks around) Nothing compared to the little bits we're gonna get chopped into when the Renaissance Faire kicks the door in. (points to the door; they both look over at it) And here we bloody sit."
XANDER,It's not like we got much of a choice.
SPIKE,"(gestures impatiently) Could make a break for it! Use General Armor-All as a shield (shot of the general) get to the doc's car, and-"
XANDER,"Great plan. And while all the hacking and slashing's going on, what are you gonna be doing, huh? Throwing migraines at 'em?"
SPIKE,"Look, we stay here, we all die! At least this way, some of us might get-"
BUFFY,(OS) No.
BUFFY,We're all gonna make it. I'm not losing anyone.
BUFFY,Check the supplies. See if anyone's hungry.
GREGOR,Dissention in the ranks. Seldom a harbinger of glad tidings.
BUFFY,Shut up.
GREGOR,Poor frightened girl. (she turns back) You've no idea what you've gotten yourself into.
BUFFY,(crosses arms over her chest) Why don't you tell me?
GREGOR,Would it make a difference?
GREGOR,What do you know of the beast?
BUFFY,Strong. Fast. Hellgod.
GREGOR,From a dimension of unspeakable torment.
BUFFY,"A demon dimension. I know. She ruled with two other hellgods, right?"
GREGOR,"Along with the beast they were a triumvirate of suffering and despair. Ruling with equal vengeance. But the beast's power grew beyond even what they could conceive. As did her lust for pain and misery. They looked upon her, what she had become ... and trembled."
BUFFY,(nervously) A god afraid?
GREGOR,"Such was her power. They feared she would attempt to seize their dimension for herself, and decided to strike first. A great battle erupted. In the end, they stood victorious over the beast ... barely. She was cast out. Banished to this lower plane of existence, forced to live and eventually die trapped within the body of a mortal ... a newborn male, created as her prison. That is the beast's ... only weakness."
BUFFY,Kill the man ... and the god dies.
GREGOR,"Unfortunately, the identity of the human vessel has never been discovered."
BUFFY,"(puzzled) I don't understand. Now, I've seen Glory. Not a whole lot going on in the hairy chest department."
GREGOR,"You have seen a glimpse of the true beast. Her power was too great to be completely contained. She's found a way to escape her mortal prison ... for brief periods, before her energies are exhausted and she's forced back ... into her living cell of meat and bone."
DAWN,(OS) What about me?
DAWN,What about the key?
BUFFY,Dawn.
DAWN,I want to know.
GREGOR,"The key ... is almost as old as the beast itself. Where it came from, how it was created ... the deepest of mysteries. All that is certain is that its power is absolute. Countless generations of my people have sacrificed their lives in search of it, to destroy it before its wrath could be unleashed."
DAWN,But the monks found it first.
GREGOR,"Yes, and hid it with their magicks."
BUFFY,Why didn't they just destroy it? If the key is as dangerous as-
GREGOR,"Because they were fools. They thought they could harness its power for the forces of light. They failed, and paid with their blood."
DAWN,What do I do? What was I created for?
GREGOR,You were created ... to open the gates that separate dimensions. The beast will use your power ... to return home and seize control of the hell she was banished from.
BUFFY,That's it? That's Glory's master plan ... to go home?
GREGOR,"You misunderstand. Once the key is activated, it won't just open the gates to the beast's dimension. It's going to open all the gates. The walls separating realities will crumble. (shot of Buffy no longer smiling. Shot of Dawn) Dimensions will bleed into each other. Order will be overthrown and the universe will tumble into chaos ... all dark ... forever."
GREGOR,(staring at Dawn) That ... is what you were created for.
Cut to,Buffy emerging from the back room into another room.
BUFFY,Dawn.
DAWN,(not turning) You think it's true ... what he said?
BUFFY,I don't know.
DAWN,"Destroyer of the universe. (pause) I guess cutting school doesn't seem so bad now, huh?"
BUFFY,It's not you. You know that.
DAWN,But it's in me ... isn't it? It's inside me.
DAWN,What are we gonna do?
BUFFY,I won't let anything happen to you. I promise.
TARA,(upset) Wriggling!
WILLOW,"Come on, Tara, you have to eat something."
ANYA,Want me to try?
WILLOW,I don't know. I'm gettin' used to pickin' fruit out of my hair.
GREGOR,(whispers) You!
GREGOR,"You are not a part of this, are you?"
BEN,(still not looking at him) Just a friend of the family.
GREGOR,Would you die for them?
GREGOR,Because that is what your future holds if you align yourself with the Slayer and her misguided people.
BEN,"(walks a little closer, angrily) It's my life, and I'll do what I please with it."
GREGOR,"It's not just your life. Unimaginable legions will perish, including everyone here. (whispers) You can stop this. You can save all their lives by ending one. The little girl. The key. Destroy it, and the will of the beast will be broken, she will fade, a distant memory ... (shot of Ben listening, looking uncertain) and all of this madness will end."
