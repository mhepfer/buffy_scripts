PROLOGUE:,"</h3>  <p><b>11INT.LIVING     ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br>    Giles scurries into the living room, where Buffy and Dawn are sitting on the     couch.</b>"
GILES,"<br>    Are you sure you'll all be all right?"
DAWN,"<br>    You'll only be gone for two days."
BUFFY,"<br>    I think we've managed a bit longer than that."
GILES,"<br>    Right. (looks around nervously, stops) Oh, Dawn, Vi's left her notebook on     the mantelpiece. Would you mind running it out to the car?"
DAWN,"<br>    (stands, goes to the fireplace) Sure."
GILES,"<br>    While you're at it, you smack her in the head with it and remind her not to     leave it lying around."
DAWN,"<br>    (walks out the front door with the notebook) On it."
GILES,"<br>    (sits on coffee table in front of Buffy) I'm just a bit twitchy about leaving     you alone again here while&#151;while things are (takes of glasses, wipes     his brow) in such a state of flux."
BUFFY,"<br>    I know. But you should go. This trip is important for the girls to understand     the source of their power, and to know how to use it right."
GILES,"<br>    Do you think they appreciate the gravity of what we're undertaking? It's frightening,     and it's difficult. And then, apparently, someone told them that the vision     quest consists of me driving them to the desert, doing the hokey pokey until     a spooky Rasta-mama slayer arrives and speaks to them in riddles. (looks at     Buffy)"
BUFFY,"<br>    (looks innocent) That's not exactly how I put it, I&#151; (sees Willow come     down stairs and enter the room) Hey, how's Kennedy?"
WILLOW,"<br>    Still fluey. Bummed about missing the field trip. (to Giles) She says she     wants you to meditate extra hard for her and to bring her back some smores.     (grins)"
GILES,"<br>    Ah yes. Smores. I'm going to end up singing campfire songs aren't I? (stands)"
BUFFY,"<br>    Oh yeah."
XANDER,"<br>    (comes in the front door, followed by Dawn) Giles, you might want to get out     there."
GILES,"<br>    Oh, God, what?"
DAWN,"<br>    Molly and Rona are fighting over who gets to drive the first leg."
BUFFY,"<br>    (to Giles) Bet you wish you renewed that California state driver's license     now, huh?"
ANYA,"<br>    (comes in the front door) Rona won. You should probably let Molly out of the     trunk. (car horn blows outside, Anya walks to the kitchen with Willow) I never     actually realized just how compact Molly really is."
GILES,"<br>    (sighs, to Buffy) Please be safe while I'm away."
BUFFY,"<br>    You too."

BUFFY,"<br>    Hey."
SPIKE,"<br>    Hey."
BUFFY,"<br>    Giles is off ...on the retreat."
SPIKE,"<br>    Give us all a chance for a breather, eh?"
BUFFY,"<br>    From Giles?"
SPIKE,"<br>    From the constant pitter patter of clomping teenage girly feet."
BUFFY,"<br>    (shrugs) I have no idea what you're talking about."
SPIKE,"<br>    Come on."
BUFFY,"<br>    No, I enjoy my responsibility as mentor, role model, life guide&#151;oh, my     God, I cannot believe I have my bathroom all to myself for two whole days.     (sits on the cot beside Spike)"
SPIKE,"<br>    (leans forward) It's like a bloody war-zone up there, and not in a good way."
BUFFY,"<br>    Have you seen the kitchen since they've been here?"
SPIKE,"<br>    I'm just trying to stay out of their way."
BUFFY,"<br>    (glances at his chains) I noticed."
SPIKE,"<br>    (looks at his chains) This is better. Believe me, it's safer."
BUFFY,"<br>    OK. But you've been fine. In close contact with the girls."
SPIKE,"<br>    (looks at Buffy) With you by my side, yeah. You won't let me hurt one of them.     And that's the way it's gonna be until we're sure the First is done making     me its bitch. Either we're together, or I'm on the leash."
BUFFY,"<br>    We just need to make sure the trigger's deactivated then. We've got a couple     of days, lack of pitter-patter and all..."
SPIKE,"<br>    (leans forward, looking at her earnestly) Buffy..."
BUFFY,"<br>    What?"
SPIKE,"<br>    Ow."
BUFFY,"<br>    Ow?"
SPIKE,"<br>    (his face contorts, twitching) Ow ow ow! (leans back, thrashes against the     wall)"
BUFFY,"<br>    What's wrong? (Spike puts his hands to his head) Spike, what is going on?"
SPIKE,"<br>    (calmer now) The chip. God. Why would&#151;? (screams) Aaahhh! (holds his     hands to his head, writhing in intense pain)"

BUFFY,"<br>    (sits) Oh, in the &quot;goes&quot; part of &quot;comes and goes.&quot;"
WILLOW,"<br>    Well there seems to be a definite lack of screaming. That has to be good."
BUFFY,"<br>    You'd think. (Willow pours hot water into a cup) That for the other patient?"
WILLOW,"<br>    Yeah. Thought I'd bring her some tea, help her feel better."
BUFFY,"<br>    (smiling, teasingly) Mm-hmm?"
WILLOW,"<br>    It's just tea."
BUFFY,"<br>    (giggles, then pauses) Will, how much do you know about the chip?"
WILLOW,"<br>    Spike's chip? Well, I remember trying to dig up stuff back then, but, you     know, turns out, when a secret government agency studies vampires and puts     chips in their brains that keep them from hurting people, they don't really     build websites. Why?"
BUFFY,"<br>    Even with the chip, Spike was able to hurt all those people when he was brainwashed."
WILLOW,"<br>    Yeah, but he was under the control of the First."
BUFFY,"<br>    Maybe something's wrong with it."
WILLOW,"<br>    The chip is misfiring all on its own, then. Well this'll be fun."
BUFFY,"<br>    Remember when things used to be nice and boring?"
WILLOW,"<br>    (shrugs) No. (walks out of the kitchen with tea in hand)"
BUFFY,"<br>    (teasingly, calls after her) Have fun...delivering tea..."
WILLOW,"<br>    (stops, turns around) OK, not when you make it sound all dirty like that.     (mumbles as she heads upstairs) It's just tea."

KENNEDY,"<br>    Willow, chill. (stands) There's a reason I didn't go. I have a thing. A separate     thing."

WILLOW,"<br>    This is a mission?"
KENNEDY,"<br>    Oh! Yeah..."
WILLOW,"<br>    And the little pink umbrellas are a signal for what? We're not on a mission,     are we?"
KENNEDY,"<br>    Hey, trust me, I told you. I have a thing. (Willow gets up to leave, Kennedy     calls after her) Come on, come on. Just hang out with me a little. (Willow     turns to face her, sighing) You're sexy when you pout."
WILLOW,"<br>    Why do you do that?"
KENNEDY,"<br>    (pouts) To get you to stay."
WILLOW,"<br>    (returns to the table, sits) All right, I'll stay for one drink, then I'm     going home."
KENNEDY,"<br>    OK. One drink. I can work with that. Let's start with the easy stuff. How     long have you known? That you're gay."
WILLOW,"<br>    Wait. That's easy? (fidgets) And you just assume that I'm&#151;I'm gay. I     mean, presume much?"
KENNEDY,"<br>    (grins) OK. How long have you enjoyed having sex with women?"
WILLOW,"<br>    (taken aback) Hey! (Kennedy chuckles) What you think you have some special     lesbidar or something?"
KENNEDY,"<br>    OK, you know there's a better word for that, right? (Willow sips her drink)     You really haven't been getting out there much, have you?"
WILLOW,"<br>    Well, I just&#151;can you always tell just&#151;just by looking at someone?"
KENNEDY,"<br>    No. No, of course not. That wouldn't be any fun. The fun part is the process     of&#151;of getting to know a girl. It's like&#151;it's like flirting in code.     It's using body language and laughing at the right jokes and&#151;and looking     into her eyes and knowing she's still whispering to you, even when she's not     saying a word. And that sense that if you can just touch her just once everything     will be OK for both of you. That's how you can tell. (sits back, grins) Or     if she's really hot, you just get her drunk&#151;see if she comes on to you."
WILLOW,"<br>    Three years ago. That's when I knew. And it wasn't women, it was woman. Just     one."
KENNEDY,"<br>    Lucky woman. (smiles)"

SPIKE,"<br>    Popped another blood vessel, I think. (Buffy hands him a towel; he wipes blood     from his nose)"
BUFFY,"<br>    There's gotta be a reason why the chip is going all wonky. Maybe it's related     to the trigger or maybe it has something to do with the new soul."
SPIKE,"<br>    Or maybe I wasn't meant to last this long. (beat) One more thing you and I     have in common, eh, pet?"

Oh, maybe I shouldn't have said that. Oh, OK, right. Well, if     some guy named Finn shows up to buy flowers&#151; Yeah. Thanks. (hangs up,     turns to Spike) Wrong number.

KENNEDY,"<br>    No, no it wasn't. You said I was there. Who did you kill, Willow?"
WILLOW*/WARREN,"<br>    It was your fault, slut."
WILLOW/WARREN*,"<br>    You tricked me. Got me to forget."
KENNEDY,"<br>    Tara...."
WILLOW/WARREN*,"<br>    Shut up!"
WILLOW*/WARREN,"<br>    (crying) Shut up! You do not get to say her name. Offering it up to whoever's     there. Tricking me into kissing you. (looking lost) I didn't&#151;I didn't     mean... what I'm saying, I&#151;I can't make&#151; (pleading) Kennedy, I can't     hold on... he's winning."
KENNEDY,"<br>    (takes a step toward Willow/Warren) No..."
WILLOW*/WARREN,"<br>    I'm being punished. I k&#151;I kissed you just&#151;just for a second, but     it was enough. I let her go. I didn't mean to."
KENNEDY,"<br>    Kissing me didn't mean th&#151;"
WILLOW*/WARREN,"<br>    No, she was never gone. She was with me. We should have been forever, and     I&#151; (cries) I let her be dead. She's really dead. (breaks down into tears)     And I killed her. (falls to the ground sobbing)"
KENNEDY,"<br>    (goes to Willow/Warren's side) Willow, no."
WILLOW*/WARREN,"<br>    (looking up to the sky) Please, baby, I'm so sorry."
WILLOW/WARREN*,"<br>    Come back. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Come back... (sobs)"
KENNEDY,"<br>    (kneels in front of Willow/Warren) Willow, I don't think you did anything     wrong. This is just magic. And I think I'm figuring the whole magic thing     out. It's just like fairy tales. (leans in for a kiss)"
WILLOW/WARREN*,"<br>    (recoils) What are you doing?"
KENNEDY,"<br>    Bringing you back to life."
KENNEDY,"<br>    (smiles) Hmm. I am good."
WILLOW,"<br>    It's&#151;it's me? (touches her face) I'm back? Oh, God..."
KENNEDY,"<br>    Are you all right?"
WILLOW,"<br>    I have no idea. (they stand) I'm so tired."
KENNEDY,"<br>    Yeah. I'll make you some tea."
