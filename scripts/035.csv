Willow,"That's right, Big Boy."
Willow,(smiles mischievously) Come and get it.
Xander,I got him! Go!
Xander,Any time now . . .
Willow,He's getting away! And . . . ow.
Oz,(shaking his head) That really never works.
Oz,Are you guys all right?
Xander,"First of all, what was with the acrobatics? How did that  happen?"
Oz,(looking in the direction that Andrew went) Wasn't Andy Hoelich on  the gymnastics team?
Xander,"(gestures with his arm) That's right, he was! (shouting after  Andrew) Cheater!"
Xander,"(to Willow) Okay, and the, uh, second problem I'm having . . .  'Come and get it, Big Boy'?"
Willow,"Well . . . (stammering) W-well, the Slayer always says a pun or-or  a witty play on words, and I think it throws the vampires off, and, and  it makes them *frightened* because I'm wisecracking. Okay, I didn't  really have a chance to work on that one, but *you* try it every time."
Oz,"Uh, if I may suggest: 'This time it's personal.' I mean, there's a  reason why it's a classic."
Xander,"(steps away) I've always been amazed with how Buffy fought,  but . . . (picks up his bag) in a way, I feel like we took her punning for  granted. (steps back)"
Willow,"(gives Xander a scolding look) Xander, past tense rule."
Xander,"Oh, sorry. I just meant we in the past took it for granted and,  uh . . . we won't when she gets back."
Willow,Do you think Buffy knows school's starting tomorrow?
Oz,Tomorrow. (Willow looks at him) Right. Big day.
Willow,"(goes to Oz) Oh, I'm gonna be busy a lot. But, but only till  3:00, and that's when you usually get up."
Xander,I can't wait to see Cordelia. (pauses) I can't believe I can't  wait to see Cordelia.
Willow,(smiling) I wonder what our first homework assignment's gonna  be.
Willow,"Hey, you're excited over Cordelia, okay? We've all got issues."
Oz,I guess we should pack it in.
Xander,Yeah.
Willow,Wouldn't it be great if Buffy just showed up tomorrow? Like  nothing happened?
Xander,"She can't just show up, she got kicked out."
Willow,"Well, yeah, I-I know. I just wish . . . I wish we knew where she  was."
Buffy,How did you find me here?
Angel,"If I was blind, I would see you."
Buffy,Stay with me.
Angel,Forever. That's the whole point. I'll never leave. (whispering  into her ear) Not even if you kill me.
Buffy,Anything else?
Roughneck,"That'll do us, Peaches."
Buffy,Pay at the counter.
Roughneck,Sure you don't want me to work it off for you?
Buffy,You guys ready?
Rickie,(still looking at his girl) Yeah. I think we're good. Um . . .  (looks at Buffy's name tag) 'Anne'.
Buffy,What'll you have?
Rickie,"Well, okay . . . What can we get with this?"
Buffy,Um . . .
Lily,(to Rickie) Can we get cake?
Rickie,(to Lily) Don't be stupid. We gotta eat healthy. We can't have  cake. (to Buffy) Can we get pie?
Buffy,We've got a peach pie. (writes the order) I can't guarantee  there's a peach in it.
Lily,(to Rickie) We shouldn't have blown all our money.
Rickie,"(to Lily) Come on, it was worth it."
Rickie,"Hey, check this out."
Buffy,"It's nice. It's nice and, uh, permanent. (smiles weakly)"
Rickie,"(looking at Lily) Yeah, forever. (puts his arm around Lily) I  mean, that's the whole point."
Lily,"Hey, do I know you?"
Buffy,(looks away) I don't think so.
Lily,(looks harder) Really? Where're you from?
Buffy,(avoids the issue) I'll get your pie.
Buffy,I'm not feeling great. (unties her apron) Do you think you can  cover for me?
Waitress,Sure. (looks at the order) Okay.
Giles,"So, no joy at the cemetery?"
Willow,"No, he got away. We still have some glitches in the system,  like . . . vampires getting away. But I think we're improving. (smiles)"
Giles,"For God's sake be careful. (they meet at the counter) I mean,  uh, I appreciate your efforts to keep the vampire population down until  Buffy returns, but, uh . . . Well, if anything should happen to you and . . .  you should be killed, I should take it somewhat amiss."
Willow,You'd be cranky?
Giles,Entirely.
Willow,"Well, we try not to get killed. (the phone in Giles' office  rings) That's part of our whole mission statement. 'Don't get killed.'"
Giles,"Good, good. (taps on one of her books) I think you're going to love  that one. (goes to get the phone)"
Willow,Hi!
Cordelia,"Hey, Willow. (puts her bag on the counter)"
Willow,How was your summer?
Cordelia,"Oh, I can't believe you brought that up. Las Palmas was the  nightmare resort. They order you around and make you have organized  (makes quotes with her fingers) 'fun', and I used sarcastic quote marks.  (takes her bag and starts out) Plus the fact there are cockroaches in  Mexico big enough to own property. It was all about dread. How was your  summer?"
Willow,"Oh, it was okay."
Cordelia,Is Xander around?
Willow,"Well, uh, yeah. Somewhere."
Cordelia,Good. Great. I haven't seen him yet. (pulls her hair behind  her ears) Do I look okay?
Willow,"Oh, yeah! (nods and smiles)"
Cordelia,(worried) How's my hair?
Willow,"Uh, it's good! (smiles)"
Cordelia,"He didn't meet anybody over the summer, did he? No, who's he  gonna meet in Sunnydale, but monsters and stuff? But then again he's  always been attracted to monsters. (worried) How's my hair?"
Willow,Still good.
Willow,(smiles hugely) Hi!
Cordelia,"Maybe he's forgotten me. (lets go) Well, I'll just have to  make him remember. (smiles) See ya. (walks off)"
Willow,(turns back to Oz) You came to visit me. (sees his books) You  came with books? Are they books for me?
Oz,"Well, actually, they're kind of for me."
Willow,I don't get it.
Oz,"Well, it's sort of a funny story. (they walk) You remember when I  didn't graduate?"
Willow,"Well, I know you had a lot of incompletes, but that's what  summer school was for."
Oz,"Yeah. Well, you remember when I didn't go?"
Teacher,"Whoa. Slow down, people. (they stop running) Summer is over.  Be somber."
Willow,But you never said anything. How am I supposed to react to this  rather alarming news?
Oz,"Well, actually, I was pretty much banking on you finding it cute."
Willow,"Well, traditionally, you know, repeating a grade isn't exactly  a turn-on. (they stop by the lounge) A-and you're practically a genius.  You're Mr. Test Scores. I-it's all a little weird."
Oz,So the cute thing is out?
Xander,Have you guys seen Cordelia?
Willow,Yeah. She's around here somewhere.
Xander,"I don't want to come on too geeky, but, uh, okay, I'm psyched!  (flashes a big grin) There's gonna be some heat, if you know what I  mean, so you guys might want to duck and cover. (Willow sighs) And I'm  starting to be geeky. (grins again) Okay, bye. (he goes, but comes right  back) How's my--"
Willow,(interrupts) Your hair is fine.
Xander,(big grin) Cool. (darts away)
Larry,"This is our year, I'm telling you. Best football season ever.  I'm so in shape, I'm a rock. (they stop by the vending machines) It's  all about egg whites. If we can focus, keep discipline, and not have  quite as many mysterious deaths, Sunnydale is gonna *rule*!"
Willow,"I'm trying to get to cute, really. But I'm still sorta stuck on  'strange'."
Oz,"Well, I'd be willing to bargain down to 'eccentric' with an option  on 'cool'."
Xander,Hey!
Cordelia,Hey.
Xander,Good summer?
Cordelia,It was all right.
Xander,Cool!
Cordelia,(sounding disappointed) Yeah.
Xander,"Well, I'll see ya."
Cordelia,"Yeah, whatever."
Ken,"Hey, how are you? Can I talk to you for a moment? I have something  you might be interested in."
Giles,"Yes? Thank you, thank you."
Giles,I have a lead.
Giles,A friend in Oakland has a-a-a sketchy report of a . . . (grabs his  overcoat) young girl fending off a group of vampires . . . (grabs his bag)  about a week ago. (looks at his watch) There's a plane out in about an  hour.
Xander,And what makes this different from the last nine leads?
Giles,"Well, I believe there's a meal on this flight."
Xander,"Look, I don't mean to poop the party here, it's just, you get  your hopes all up, and then it's just a big fat raspberry, and I feel  bad."
Willow,"But it's good that you're looking, though.  You shouldn't give  up."
Xander,"Oh, yeah.  Definitely."
Giles,"Yes, one must try.  Well, I-I-I should go. (rushes out)"
Willow,You don't think maybe he'll find her?
Xander,I think he'll find her when she wants to be found.
Lily,Anne?
Lily,(louder) Anne?
Lily,Buffy?
Lily,Don't be mad.  I won't turn you in or nothing.  I guess you don't  recognize me.
Buffy,(thinks for a moment) Lily?
Lily,"I mean from before.  I was calling myself Chantarelle then.  I used  to . . . (sighs) Well, I was in this cult that worshipped vampires.  So  lame, I know."
Buffy,"Yeah . . . I, uh, I remember."
Lily,But . . . you kinda saved us.  I never thanked you or anything.
Buffy,Did you tell anyone who I was?
Lily,"Oh, no!  Not-not even Rickie.  I mean, I was so surprised to see  you here, waiting tables . . . But I wouldn't tell.  I know how it is when  you gotta get lost."
Buffy,"Do you, uh, do you live nearby?"
Lily,"Well, there's a couple of places. Uh, they're abandoned, and a  lot of people stay there. (pauses) So how come you came up with Anne?"
Buffy,It's my middle name.
Lily,Lily's from a song. Rickie picked it. I'm always changing anyway.  Chantarelle was part of my exotic phase.
Buffy,It's nice. It's a . . .it's a mushroom.
Lily,It is? That's really embarrassing.
Buffy,"Um, well, i-it's an exotic mushroom, if that's any comfort."
Lily,"Well, before that, I was following this loser preacher and  calling myself ""Sister Sunshine."""
Buffy,What do they call you at home?
Buffy,I like Lily.
Lily,"It's cool for now. Hey, do you have any money?"
Lily,"I didn't mean that like-- Well, I just mean . . . I know this guy,  he's gonna have this kinda rave thing in his basement. We could go. I  mean, I could show you if you had-- 'Cause I'm broke."
Buffy,I-I don't think so. I just kind of . . . I want to be alone.
Lily,I didn't mean to bug you.
Buffy,"No! I-I didn't, I didn't mean that, it's just . . . Well, a-a lot  of people like that, it's, it's too much."
Buffy,"I-I do have the money, though, so, why don't you and Rickie go,  and then maybe I could meet you some other time--"
Lily,"No. It's okay, it's okay. Forget about it. Just--"
Lily,That's not very polite.
Buffy,Are you okay?
Lily,Are you okay?
Driver,"Jeez, I didn't see you."
Lily,"Oh . . . Maybe, maybe you shouldn't move."
Driver,Maybe you should lie down.
Buffy,"No, I'm fine."
Driver,Somebody call an ambulance!
Buffy,"No! I'm okay, I just . . . I need to go."
Ken,Whoa! (sees his leaflets) Oh . . .
Ken,Where are you running to?
Buffy,Sorry.
Ken,"Maybe I should ask, where are you running from?"
Ken,"You're pretty new around here.  Uh, you've got the 'look', though."
Buffy,The 'look'?
Ken,Like you had to grow up way too fast.  What's your name?
Buffy,Anne. (pushes past him to go)
Ken,"Hey, um, I'm Ken.  Here, go ahead, take one of these."
Ken,"Don't be shy about stopping by.  I mean, I guess you're not  starving, but . . . we're not just interested in feeding the body.  You  might find something you're missing."
Buffy,(looks up at him) I'm alright.
Ken,"(gives her a look of disbelief) Then why are you here? (Buffy  looks away) This is not a good place for a kid to be.  You get old fast  here. (Buffy looks up at him knowingly) The thing that drains the life  out of them is despair.  I mean, kids come here, and they got nothing to  go home to, and . . . this ends up being the last stop for a lot of them.  (Buffy looks down the street) Shouldn't have to be that way."

Xander,"Boy, I'm glad we showed up for ""Depressing Night."""
Willow,I wonder what she's doing right now.
Xander,"Oh, I know what she's doing.  Gabbing to all of her friends  about her passionate affair with Pedro the Cabana Boy, laughing about  me, thinking how she still might have feelings about me."
Xander,"Oh, it's possible you were talking about Buffy."
Willow,It's possible.  The Bronze just never seems the same without  her.
Xander,"Yeah, and the slaying isn't getting any easier, either."
Oz,I don't know.  I think we're kinda getting a rhythm down.
Xander,We're losing half the vamps.
Oz,"Yeah, but . . . rhythmically."
Willow,"We just need to work on our timing, I think."
Xander,"(looks up) No, I know what we need."
Oz,A Vampire Slayer?
Xander,Next best thing.
Lyrics,<I>Ooo-ooo / My own way to freedom</I>
Xander,Bait.
Joyce,"Uh, hello."
Giles,"Hello. Um, may I . . . (gestures inside)"
Joyce,"Oh, uh, of course. (waves him in) Come on in."
Giles,"Thank you. (slowly walks into the living room) I've, uh, just  come back from Oakland. A friend of mine called with a lead. Stories  about someone fighting vampires. (takes off his glasses) It, uh, didn't  pan out, I'm afraid. (starts to clean them)"
Joyce,(sighs) No Buffy.
Giles,No vampires.  Bunch of school kids in heavy mascara listening to  extremely silly music.
Joyce,"Well, thank you for going. (steps into the living room and  crosses her arms) I can hardly, uh . . . (exhales and smiles weakly) I can  hardly leave the house.  I'm just afraid she'll call and she'll need my  help."
Giles,"(puts his glasses back on) Buffy is the most capable child I've  ever known.  I mean, she may be confused, u-unhappy, but I, uh, honestly believe  she's in no danger."
Joyce,(lowers her arms) I just wish I could talk to her.  The last  thing we did was fight. (fidgets with her hands)
Giles,"Joyce, you mustn't blame yourself for her leaving."
Joyce,(nods) I don't. (takes a breath) I blame you. (exhales)
Joyce,"You've been this huge influence on her, guiding her.  You had  this whole relationship with her behind my back.  I feel like you've  taken her away from me."
Giles,I didn't make Buffy who she is.
Joyce,And who exactly is she?
Lily,"Buff--um, Anne? Can I talk to you?"
Buffy,"Look, this really isn't a good time. Can it wait?"
Lily,Rickie's gone. I haven't seen him for more than a day.  I--he's  never left for that long.  I think something's . . . happened.  Maybe  something's happened.
Buffy,"Well, did you call the police?"
Lily,"(sighs) Rickie skipped out on his parole.  Uh, they would just  cause more trouble."
Buffy,"(exhales) I don't know, did you, did you ask around?"
Lily,Can you help me?
Buffy,"Uh, I-I can't. (walks away)"
Lily,"(follows) But . . . but that's who you are and stuff, right? I mean,  you help people, and, you know--"
Buffy,"I can't get into this. I'm sorry, Lily."
Lily,"You, you know how to do stuff."
Buffy,I don't. (exhales) Not anymore.
Lily,But . . . (whining) I don't know what to do.
Lily,We gave blood lots of times 'cause you get a few bucks.  And they  have cookies!
Buffy,You're a fan of the sugar rush?
Lily,(smiles) It's nice.
Nurse,Hi.  You here to donate blood?
Buffy,"Uh, we're looking for a friend."
Lily,Rickie T.?  We come in sometimes.
Nurse,"Rickie, sure.  Uh, he's not here."
Buffy,"Well, do you know if he's been in the last day or so?"
Nurse,"Well, let me check the sheet."
Man,(off camera) Ow!
Buffy,This'll probably go faster if we split up.
Lily,(nods in agreement) Can I come with you?
Buffy,"Okay, where did I lose you on the whole ""splitting up"" thing?"
Lily,(smiles) Oh.  Sorry.
Buffy,"I was thinking we could check out some of your hangouts and, um,  I guess, meet later at my place."
Lily,Okay.
Nurse,"Sorry, guys.  He hasn't been here."
Buffy,Thanks.
Nurse,I'll tell him you were looking.
Buffy,Great.
Buffy,Rickie?
Lily,"Did you find Rickie?  I thought of--well, he likes to go to this  movie house, you can get in around the back--"
Buffy,(interrupting) Lily . . . I think he's dead.
Lily,(very sad and lost) But . . . he takes care of me.
Buffy,I'm sorry.
Lily,We're gonna get a place.  His cousin can get him a job at the car  wash.
Buffy,"Lily, there's (exhales) there's something else. (sits on the  bed) The, the person that I found . . . was old.  He-he looked about eighty."
Lily,"Well, that's not Rickie!"
Buffy,"I'm sure it was.  I, I don't know how, but . . . it was like  something drained the life out of him."
Lily,Do you mean like a vampire?
Buffy,No.  A vampire couldn't accelerate the aging process.  Maybe it  was something in his blood. (has a thought) When was the last time you  guys gave blood together?
Lily,"I don't understand.  Maybe it's not Rickie, okay?"
Buffy,"(stands up) Lily, this is something you're just gonna have to  deal with."
Lily,(flustered) But he didn't do anything wrong!  Why would this  happen to him?
Buffy,That's *not* the point. (Lily calms a bit) These things happen  all the time.  You can't just . . . close your eyes and hope that they're  gonna go away.
Lily,Is it 'cause of you?
Buffy,(confused) What?
Lily,You know about . . . monsters and stuff.  You could have brought this  with you.
Buffy,"(very annoyed) I didn't bring anything with me.  And I didn't ask  for you to come to me with your problems.  I just wanted to be left  alone.  If you can't deal, then *don't* lay it off on me!"
Ken,Are you okay?
Ken,"Hey, it's okay.  Maybe I can help."
Lily,(sniffles) You can't. (breathes deeply)
Ken,"Look, I know you all think I'm a big square handing out leaflets  about hope.  But hope is a real thing, just like despair.  And hope can  fill up a part of you that's missing."
Lily,But Rickie . . .
Ken,"Rickie?  Say, are you Lily? (smiles) Right!  Right, he was talking about  you."
Lily,(faces him) You've seen Rickie?
Ken,"Oh, sure!  Rickie's with us now."
Lily,She said he was dead.
Ken,"Well, someone's sure handed you a tall tale.  Rickie's no more dead  than I am.  Why don't you come to Family Home?  We'll get you taken care  of."
Buffy,Candidate for what?
Nurse,What are you doing?
Buffy,Breaking into your office and going through your private files.  (looks at another file) Candidate for what?
Nurse,I'm calling the police.
Buffy,"Now, you've got a whole bunch of candidates here.  I wonder if  any of them are missing like Rickie. (faces the nurse) Gosh, I bet they  are."
Nurse,You're getting yourself in a lot of trouble.
Buffy,"I don't want any trouble.  I just want to be alone and quiet in a  room with a chair and a fireplace and a tea cozy.  I don't even know what  a tea cozy is, but I want one.  Instead, I keep getting trouble, which I  am more than willing to share. (the nurse looks at her nervously) What  are you doing with these kids?"
Nurse,Nothing.  I just . . . I give him the names of the healthy ones.
Buffy,Give them to who?
Ken,"Well, don't you look nice?"
Lily,I guess.
Ken,"Well, you don't want to wear your own outfit to the cleansing.  It'll get soaked."
Lily,A cleansing is like a baptism?  Right?
Ken,Not quite the same.
Lily,Will I see Rickie after?
Ken,"Oh, of course.  He's waiting for you.  He's very excited."
Cordelia,Why do I have to be bait?  I'm always bait.  Why can't Willow  be bait?
Xander,He's already seen Willow.  And could you complain louder so that  all the vampires leave?
Oz,I think this is a good spot.
Oz,Is everybody packin'?
Oz,Let's do it.
Cordelia,I'm doing this for Buffy's sake.  This has nothing to do with  you.
Xander,"Yeah, like I needed that cleared up. (finds a hiding place) Go  away.  This is my hiding spot."
Cordelia,Where do I hide?
Xander,You don't hide.  You're bait.  Go act baity.
Cordelia,What's the plan?
Xander,The vampire attacks you.
Cordelia,And then what?
Xander,"The vampire kills you.  We watch, we rejoice."
Cordelia,Everything's a joke with you.
Xander,"No, just our relationship."
Cordelia,What relationship?
Xander,"Oh, that's right, I forgot.  We actually want to bury that piece  of the past, don't we?"
Ken,"We come to this station to wash away the past.  Go ahead, kneel."
Ken,We let the water run over the sin and the pain and the  uncertainty.
Lily,It looks kinda . . . dirty.
Ken,(smiles) Yeah.
Buffy,"You know, I just . . . I woke up, and I looked in the mirror, and I  thought, ""hey, what's with all the sin?  I need to change.  I'm . . . I'm  dirty.  I'm, I'm bad with the . . . sex and the envy and that, that loud  music us kids listen to nowadays.  W--"" (sees that the guy isn't buying  it) Oh, I just suck at undercover.  Where's Ken?"
Ken,This is a private moment.  If you could just--
Buffy,"How do you make 'em old, Ken?  Do you feed on youth?  What's the  deal?"
Ken,Do you really wanna know?
Lily,(looks back) What's going on?
Buffy,Lily.
Lily,(in pain) Oh . . .
Ken,"Oh, my face!"
Ken,Ow!  My face!
Ken,Do you have any idea how hard it is to glue that thing on?!
Ken,(yells) Guards!
Ken,Welcome to my world.  I hope you like it.
Ken,(to Lily) You're never leaving.
Xander,"Let me just ask you one thing: how long did it take you to forget me?  Were you  still taxiing down the runway, or was it actually in the cab?"
Cordelia,"Oh, yeah, Mr. Faithful?  You probably met up with some hot  little Inca Mummy Girl.  Yeah!  I heard about her."
Willow,Help!
Cordelia,Xander!
Buffy,Oh. Unh . . . (slowly sits up) Lily?
Lily,I always knew I would come here . . . sooner or later.  I knew I  belonged here.
Buffy,(looks around) Where?
Lily,Hell.
Buffy,(turns her head toward Lily) This isn't Hell.
Ken,(appears at the bars) Isn't it?
Buffy,(in pain) Unh . . . (rubs her forehead)
Ken,"What is Hell but the total absence of hope?  The substance, the  tactile proof of despair.  You're right, Lily.  This is where you've been  heading all your life.  Just like Rickie."
Lily,Rickie?
Ken,"He forgot you.  Well, it took him a long time.  He remembered your  name years after he'd forgotten his own. But, in the end--"
Lily,Years? But--
Ken,"Oh.  Uh, interesting thing: time moves more quickly here than in  your reality.  A hundred long years will pass here.  On Earth, it's just a  day."
Buffy,So you just work us till we're too old and spit us back out.
Ken,"That's the plan.  See, Lily, you'll die of old age before anyone  wonders where you went.  Not that anyone will, that's why we chose you."
Buffy,You didn't choose me.
Ken,No.  But . . . I know you . . . *Anne*.  So afraid.  So pathetically  determined to run away from whatever it is you used to be. (Buffy looks  away) To disappear.  Congratulations. (Buffy looks at him again) You got  your wish.
Guard,"You work, and you live.  That is all."
Guard,"You do not complain or laugh or do anything besides work.  Whatever you thought, whatever you were, does not matter.  You are no one  now.  You mean nothing."
Guard,Who are you?
Aaron,(afraid) Aaron.
Guard,Who are you?
Lily,(whimpers) No one.
Guard,Who are you?
Guard,Who are you?
Buffy,(friendly) I'm Buffy.  The Vampire Slayer.  And you are?
Buffy,"Anyone who's not having fun here, follow me."
Buffy,"(looking up at the guards) There's no way we can get back up  there without meeting new people. (looks at Lily) Okay.  Lily, when those  guards leave--and they will leave--I want you to take these people and  get them up there, okay?  Fast and quiet."
Lily,You're leaving me? But--
Buffy,Lily . . . You can handle this.  'Cause I say so.
Buffy,"We've gone public.  Okay, quick, get them up.  Go!  Quiet!"
Lily,I'm sorry I said this was your fault before.
Buffy,"Lily, this can wait."
Lily,"Well, in case we die--"
Buffy,Go! Go!
Guard,Get out of the way!
Guard,"Come on, get out of the way!"
Lily,"C'mon, c'mon, everybody go!  Go!"
Ken,Humans don't fight back.
Ken,(enraged) Humans don't fight back!
Ken,That's how this works!
Ken,(to the guards with him) Get down there!
Ken,One of you fights . . . and you all die!
Ken,That . . . was not . . . permitted.
Buffy,"Yeah, but it was fun."
Ken,(smiles) You've got guts.  I think I'd like to slice you open and  play with them.
Ken,Let everyone know!
Ken,*This* is the price of rebellio--
Lily,They'll be coming.
Buffy,(grunts) Okay . . . this . . . works . . . the abs . . . and . . . the glutes.  (grunts)
Buffy,I'm gonna feel this for a week!
Ken,You've *ruined* . . . You . . .
Buffy,"Hey, Ken, wanna see my impression of Gandhi?"
Lily,Gandhi?
Buffy,"Well, you know, if he was really pissed off."
Lily,(points) What do we do about--
Buffy,Let me give you the tour.
Buffy,This concludes our tour.
Lily,It's really nice.
Buffy,All the rent's paid up for the next three weeks.
Buffy,"I spoke to Mitch at the diner. (pulls out her uniform) He said  you can start on Thursday. (steps over to the bed) He's, uh . . . (lays  down the uniform) he's kind of . . . repulsive, but, uh, he won't give you  a hard time."
