Xander,Is she dying?
Buffy,I think she's singing.
Xander,To a telephone in Hindi. Now that's entertainment!
Xander,Why is she singing?
Willow,"She's sad because her lover gave her twelve gold coins, but  then the wizard cut open the bag of salt, and now the dancing minions  have nowhere to put their big maypole... fish thing. (takes a sip of her  drink)"
Xander,Uh-huh. Why is she singing?
Buffy,Her lover? I thought that was her chiropractor.
Willow,"Because of that thing he did with her feet? No, that was  personal."
Xander,Hmm. And we thought just because we didn't have any money or  anyplace to go this would be a lackluster evening.
Willow,I know! We could go to the Bronze and sneak in our own tea bags  and ask for hot water. (smiles)
Xander,"Hop off the outlaw train, Will, before you land us all in jail."
Buffy,"I, for one, am giddy and up. There's a kinda hush all over  Sunnydale. No demons or vampires to slay, I'm here with my friends...  (tilts her head at the TV) So, how does the water buffalo fit in again?"
Richard,"Callie! Callie, where're you going? The party's just getting  started."
Cordelia,"(fake laughter) See? Dr. Debi says when a man is speaking you  make serious eye contact, and you really, really listen, and you laugh  at everything he says. (laughs again)"
Willow,You dreamed about Angel again?
Buffy,Third night in a row.
Willow,What did he do in the dream?
Buffy,Stuff.
Willow,(smiles wide) Oh! Stuff! (Buffy smiles) Was it one of those  vivid dreams where you could feel his lips and smell his hair?
Buffy,It had surroundsound. I'm just thinking about him so much  lately.
Willow,"You two are so right for each other. Except for the, uh..."
Buffy,Vampire thing.
Willow,That doesn't make him a bad person. Necessarily.
Buffy,I'm brainsick. I can't have a relationship with him.
Willow,"Not during the day, but you could ask him for coffee some  night. It's the non-relationship drink of choice."
Willow,"It's not a date, it's a caffeinated beverage. Okay, sure, it's  hot and bitter like a relationship that way, but..."
Xander,What's like a relationship?
Buffy,Nothing I have. Coffee?
Xander,Huh?
Cordelia,"(to the girl) There's really no comparison between college  men and high school boys. (looks up at Xander) I mean, look at that."
Xander,"So, Cor, you're datin' college guys now."
Cordelia,"Well, not that it's any of your business, but I happen to be  dating a Delta Zeta Kappa."
Xander,Oh! An extra-terrestrial. So that's how you get a date after  you exhausted all the human guys.
Cordelia,"You'll go to college someday, Xander. I just know your pizza  delivery career will take you so many exciting places."
Buffy,"(remembering) Oh! I told Giles I'd meet him in the library ten  minutes ago! Aw, he won't be upset. There hasn't been much paranormal  activity lately."
Giles,Just because the paranormal is more normal and less... para of  late is no excuse for tardiness or letting your guard down.
Buffy,I haven't let my guard down.
Giles,"Oh, really? You yawned your way through weapons training last  week, you, you, you, you skipped hand-to-hand entirely... Are you gonna  be prepared if a demon springs up behind you and does this?"
Giles,"(in pain) Yeah, well, I'm, I'm not a demon. Which is why you  should let go now."
Giles,(quietly) Thank you.
Giles,"When you live on top of a... a mystical convergence it's only a  matter of time before a fresh hell breaks loose. Now is the time that  you should train more strictly, you should hunt and patrol more keenly,  you should hone your skills day and night."
Buffy,"And the little slice of life that still belongs to me from, I  don't know, seven to seven-oh-five in the morning, can I do what I want  then?"
Giles,"Buffy, you think I don't know what it's like to be sixteen?"
Buffy,No. I think you *don't* know what it's like to be sixteen. And a  girl. And the Slayer.
Giles,"Fair enough, no, no, I-I don't."
Buffy,Or what it's like to have to stake vampires while you're having  fuzzy feelings towards one?
Giles,Uh...
Buffy,Digging on the undead doesn't exactly do wonders for your social  life.
Giles,"That's exactly where, where being... different, uh, comes in  handy."
Buffy,Right! Who needs a social life when you've got your very own  Hellmouth?
Giles,"Yes! Y-you, you, you have a duty, a-a-a purpose, y-y-you have a  commitment in life. Now how many people your age can say that?"
Buffy,We talkin' foreign or domestic? How 'bout none?
Giles,"(he's had enough) Well, here's a hard fact of life: we all have  to do things we don't like! And you have hand-to-hand this afternoon and  patrol tonight. So I, I suggest you come straight here at the end of, of  period six a-and you get your homework done. And don't dawdle with your  friends. (Buffy pouts) And, and don't think sitting there pouting is  gonna get to me, because it won't."
Giles,(looks away) It's not getting to me.
Xander,"Boy, what a long day."
Willow,And you skipped three classes.
Xander,"Yeah, and, of course, *they* flew by. (they reach Buffy) Buffy!"
Willow,Aren't you supposed to be doing your homework in the library?
Buffy,I'm dawdling (takes Xander's arm) with my friends.
Xander,Works for me.
Buffy,(to Willow) You okay?
Willow,Jeez.
Richard,Cordelia.
Cordelia,"Hi, Richard. Nice car."
Richard,"So, uh, we're having a little get-together tomorrow night at  the house, and it's gonna be a really special evening."
Richard,Excuse me?
Cordelia,"Oh! I would, I would love, *love* to go!"
Richard,"So, who's your friend? (indicates Buffy)"
Cordelia,"(looks) Her? Oh, she's not my friend."
Tom,She's amazing!
Cordelia,"She's more like a sister, really! We're that close."
Richard,"Well, why don't you introduce us?"
Cordelia,(realizes she's trapped herself) Okay. (goes to get Buffy)
Xander,"Okay, so tonight, channel fifty-nine, Indian TV, sex, lies,  incomprehensible story lines. I'll bring the betel nuts."
Cordelia,(reaches for Buffy's hand) Come on. Richard and his  fraternity brother wanna meet you.
Buffy,"Well, I don't really wanna meet any fraternity boys."
Cordelia,"(pulls her) And if there was a God, don't you think he'd keep  it that way?"
Xander,"Uh, I-I believe we were dawdling here!"
Richard,"Hi, sweetheart. I'm Richard. And you are?"
Buffy,*So* not interested. (tries to leave)
Cordelia,"(grabs Buffy's hand) Heh, she's such a little comedienne."
Richard,"What, she likes to play hard to get?"
Tom,"No, Richard. I think you're playing easy to resist."
Tom,"Ah, feel free to ignore him. I do all the time. (she stops) I'm  Tom Warner. I'm a senior at Crestwood College, and I... and I just feel  like a complete dolt meeting you this way, so... (crosses his arms) here  I stand in all my doltishness."
Xander,"Huh-huh-huh, right. Like she's gonna fall for that."
Buffy,I'm Buffy Summers.
Tom,"Oh, nice to meet you. Are you a senior here?"
Buffy,Junior.
Tom,"Oh, me, too. Except that I'm a senior and I'm in college. So we  have that in common, and... I major in history."
Buffy,Mm. History stumps me. I have a hard enough time remembering  what happened last week.
Tom,"No, nothin' happened last week, don't worry, I was there."
Xander,She's gonna walk away. (pauses) Now.
Tom,"So, uh, my friend invited your friend to a party we're having this  weekend."
Tom,"You know, actually he's not even really my friend. I only joined  the fraternity because my father and grandpa were in it before me.  Y'know, it meant a lot to them."
Xander,"Okay, boots, start a-walking."
Tom,"Oh, I know, I talk too much anyway. They're really dull parties  full of really dull people, so... would you like to come and save me  from a really dull fate?"
Buffy,"Oh, I wish I could, but I'm sort of involved."
Tom,"Well, sure, of course you are. Well, thanks for letting me ramble."
Buffy,"Y'know, people underestimate the value of a good ramble."
Giles,Buffy!
Buffy,"Oh, I gotta go. (turns to go but stops and smiles) It was nice  to meet you."
Tom,Oh. Same here.
Xander,I hate these guys. Whatever they want just falls into their  laps. Don't you hate these guys?
Willow,"Yeah, with their charmed lives and their movie star good looks  and more money than you can count? I'm hating."
Giles,"I'm going to attack you. A word of warning: for your own good, I  won't be pulling any punches. (adopts a fighting stance)"
Buffy,Please don't.
Giles,"Good. So, um, you're on patrol and, uh, I'll see you in the  morning."
Angel,There's blood on it.
Buffy,(gets up startled and faces him) Hi. It's nice to... Blood?
Angel,I can smell it.
Buffy,Oh. (looks at the bracelet) It's pretty thin. It probably  belonged to a girl.
Angel,Probably.
Buffy,"(exhales) I-I was... just thinking, wouldn't it be funny some  time to see each other when it wasn't a blood thing. (smiles briefly)  Not funny ha, ha."
Angel,"What are you sayin', you wanna have a date?"
Buffy,No.
Angel,You don't wanna have a date?
Buffy,Who said 'date'? I-I-I never said 'date'.
Angel,Right. You just wanna have coffee or somethin'.
Buffy,(hopefully) Coffee?
Angel,I knew this was gonna happen.
Buffy,What? What do you think is happening?
Angel,You're sixteen years old. I'm two hundred and forty-one.
Buffy,I've done the math.
Angel,"You don't know what you're doing, you don't know what you  want..."
Buffy,"Oh. No, I, I think I do. I want out of this conversation.  (starts to walk past him)"
Angel,"(bumps into her) Listen, if we date you and I both know one  thing's gonna lead to another."
Buffy,One thing already has led to another. You think it's a little  late to be reading me a warning label?
Angel,I'm just tryin' to protect you. This could get outta control.
Buffy,Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?
Angel,"This isn't some fairy tale. When I kiss you, you don't wake up  from a deep sleep and live happily ever after."
Buffy,No. When you kiss me I wanna die.
Cordelia,"Buffy! Did you lose weight? And your hair... Alright, I  respect you too much to be dishonest. The hair's a little... (smiles  widely) Well, that really isn't the point here, is it? The Zeta Kappas  have to have a certain balance at their party, and Richard explained it  all to me, but I was so busy really listening that I didn't hear much.  Anyway, the deal is they need you to go. And if you don't go, I can't.  And I'm talking about Richard Anderson, okay? As in Anderson Farms,  Anderson Aeronautics (becomes emotional) and Anderson Cosmetics. (sobs)  Well, you see why I *have* to go. Buffy, these men are rich. And I am  *not* being shallow. Think of all the poor people I could help with all  my money!"
Buffy,(off in her own world) I'll go.
Cordelia,"(surprised) You'll go? (huge smile) Great! I'll drive. Oh,  Buffy, it's like we're sisters! With really different hair."
Richard,I pledge my life and my death...
Pledge,I pledge my life and my death...
Richard,"To the Delta Zeta Kappas, and to Machida whom we serve..."
Pledge,"To the Delta Zeta Kappas, and to Machida whom we serve..."
Richard,On my oath before my assembled brethren...
Pledge,(ignores the pain) On my oath before my assembled brethren...
Richard,I promise to keep our secret from this day until my death.
Pledge,I promise to keep our secret from this day until my death.
Richard,In blood I was baptized. In blood I shall reign. In his name.
Pledge,"In blood I was baptized, and in blood I shall reign. In his  name."
Richard,You are now one of us.
Pledge,In his name!
Brothers,In his name.
Richard,Brewski time!
Richard,So what's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
Callie,(begs) Let me go.
Richard,"Let you go? Okay, let me think. Um, no! (laughs) God, I love  high school girls. Mm!"
Willow,You're going to the fraternity party? What made you change your  mind?
Buffy,Angel.
Willow,He's going with you? (to Xander) She's got a date with Angel!  Isn't that exciting?
Xander,I'm elated. (gets up from the couch)
Buffy,I-I'm not going with Angel. I'm going with -- ye gods --  Cordelia. (starts out of the lounge)
Willow,"Cordelia?! (to Xander) Did I sound a little jealous just then,  'cause I'm not really... (runs after Buffy) Cordelia?!"
Xander,Cordelia's much better for you than Angel. (hurries after them)
Willow,(catches up) What happened with Angel?
Buffy,"Nothing, as usual. A whole lotta nothing with Angel."
Xander,Bummer.
Willow,"I don't understand. I mean, he likes you. More than likes."
Buffy,Angel barely says two words to me.
Xander,Don't you hate that?
Buffy,"And when he does, he treats me like I'm a child."
Xander,That bastard!
Buffy,"You know, at least Tom can carry on a conversation."
Xander,Yeah! Tom? Who's Tom?
Willow,The frat guy.
Xander,"Oh, Buffy, I don't think so. Frying pan, fire? You know what  I'm sayin'."
Giles,Will you be ready if a vampire's behind you?
Giles,I didn't see you three... creeping about.
Giles,"Um, how did it go last night?"
Buffy,Found this. (gives him the bracelet)
Giles,(reads the inscription) E-N-T.
Willow,I've seen something like that before.
Buffy,It's broken in two. I don't know what the rest of the letters  might have spelled. And there's blood on it.
Giles,"Uh, I didn't see any."
Buffy,Angel showed up. He could smell it.
Xander,The blood? There's a guy you wanna party with.
Giles,Blood.
Willow,In Sunnydale. What a surprise.
Xander,"Okay, here's what we're gonna do: she should probably make the  rounds again tonight, and we should try to figure out who that bracelet  belongs to."
Giles,"Yes, good idea, yes. She'll patrol, and, and we'll reconvene..."
Buffy,"(interrupting) Uh, hello? She's standing right here? And she's  not available."
Giles,Why not?
Xander,"Buffy, this is a little more important than..."
Buffy,"I've got a mountain of homework to do, and, um... my mom's not  really feeling well, and she could probably use my help, and, um, to be  truthful I'm not really feeling all that well myself."
Giles,"Oh, w-w-well, um, sorry, of course. If-if-if you're not well."
Buffy,"Oh, I'll take an early pass this evening, and, um, one later on,  but for the bulk of the evening..."
Giles,"Oh, you should stay home with your mother."
Buffy,"Well, say it."
Xander,I'm not gonna say it.
Willow,You lied to Giles.
Xander,'Cause she will.
Buffy,"Look, I wasn't lying. I was just... protecting him from  information that he wouldn't be able to... digest properly."
Xander,Like a corn dog.
Willow,"Like you don't have a sick mother, but you'd rather go to a  frat party where there's gonna be drinking and older guys and probably  an orgy."
Xander,"Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho, rewind. Since when do they have orgies, and  why aren't I on the mailing list?"
Buffy,There's no orgies!
Willow,I heard a lot of wild things go on at frat parties.
Buffy,"Okay, you know what? Look, seven days a week I am busy saving  the world. Once in a great while I wanna have some fun. And that's what  I'm gonna have tonight. Fun!"
Cordelia,"This isn't about fun. This is about duty, your duty, to help  me achieve permanent prosperity. Okay? Do's and dont's: don't wear  black, silk, chiffon or spandex. These are my trademarks. And don't do  that weird thing with your hair."
Buffy,What weird thing with my...
Cordelia,"Don't interrupt. Do be interested if someone should speak to  you. It may or may not happen, but do be polite. And laugh at the  appropriate intervals. (demonstrates) Do lie to your mom about where  we're going. It's a fraternity, and there will be drinking."
Xander,"So, Cor, you printing up business cards with your pager number  and hours of operation, or just going with a halter top tonight?"
Cordelia,"Oh, are we feeling a little envious? You could belong to a  fraternity of rich and powerful men. In the Bizarro world."
Buffy,Do you guys wanna join us?
Xander,"Nah, I gotta... digest and all."
Cordelia,"Makeup, makeup... Well, give it your all, and keep to the  shadows. We're gonna have a blast! (smiles)"
Willow,I can't believe she lied to Giles. My world is all askew.
Xander,"Buffy's lying, Buffy's going to frat parties... That's not  askew, that's cockeyed."
Willow,Askew means cockeyed.
Xander,Oh.
Willow,"Well, there's nothing we can do about it. We'll help Giles."
Xander,I'm goin' to the party.
Willow,What?
Xander,I gotta keep an eye on Buffy. Those frat guys creep me.
Willow,You wanna protect her?
Xander,Mm-hm.
Willow,"And prove that you're just as good as those rich, snotty guys?"
Xander,Mm-hm.
Willow,Maybe catch an orgy?
Xander,If it's on early.
Cordelia,Ohh! Why do they park so darn close to you? Are you ready for  this? (checks her hair)
Buffy,I dunno. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Cordelia,"Me, too. Let's go!"
Cordelia,C'mon!
Tackle,Beaucoup babes!
Linebacker,"Ooo, yeah!"
Cordelia,"You know what's so cool about college? The diversity. You've  got all the rich people, and all the other people. (spots Richard)  Richard!"
Richard,"Welcome, ladies. (hands them drinks)"
Cordelia,Thank you.
Buffy,"Oh, i-is there alcohol in this?"
Richard,Just a smidge.
Cordelia,"C'mon, Buffy, it's just a smidge."
Buffy,I'll just... (sets the drink down)
Richard,I understand. When I was your age I wasn't into grownup things  either. Have you seen our multi-media room?
Cordelia,"Oh, the one with the cherry walnut paneling and the two  forty-eight-inch televisions on satellite feed? No. Wanna show me?  (smiles)"
Richard,What about...
Cordelia,"Oh, her? She's happiest by herself."
Lyrics,<I>Her name is Alexandra / She walks into the room</I>
Lyrics,"<I>All the eyes, eyes, are upon her</I>"
Xander,Cheers!

Tackle,New girl!
Tackle,Dance!
Lyrics,<I>So bend and I'll break you</I>
Tackle,"(laughs and staggers over to her) C'mon, sweetheart, ha, ha,  yeah!"
Lyrics,<I>Leave and I'll take you back again</I>
Tom,Can I have this dance?
Tackle,C'mon!
Lyrics,"<I>If she bends, then she breaks</I>"
Buffy,Thanks.
Lyrics,"<I>She loves you, but then she takes it away</I>"
Tom,No. We're not all a bunch of drunken louts. Some of us are sober  louts.
Lyrics,<I>She bends and she bows</I>
Tom,I'm really glad that you decided to come.
Lyrics,"<I>She's cold, but she melts like snow</I>"
Tom,And you're not.
Buffy,"No, it's... I shouldn't be here."
Lyrics,<I>Bend and I'll break you</I>
Tom,Because you're seeing someone.
Buffy,No.
Tom,You're not seeing someone?
Lyrics,<I>Sleep and I'll wake you tonight</I>
Buffy,Someone's not seeing me.
Tom,"So, why shouldn't you be here?"
Lyrics,"<I>Hey, don't you want to understand / Understand that</I>"
Buffy,"Because I have obligations. People that I'm responsible for, or  to, or... (Tom laughs and so does she) with, or... It's complicated."
Lyrics,"<I>If she bends, then she breaks</I>"
Tom,You're big on responsibility. I like that. But there's such a  thing as being too mature.
Lyrics,"<I>She loves you, but then she takes it away</I>"
Tom,You should relax. Enjoy yourself once in a while.
Lyrics,<I>She bends and she bows</I>
Buffy,You think I'm too mature?
Tom,(chuckles) I talk too much. Have you picked up on that yet?
Lyrics,"<I>She's cold, but she melts like snow</I>"
Tom,"Anyway, the, uh, the Hulk is gone, so you don't have to dance with  me."
Lyrics,"<I>She bends, she breaks</I>"
Buffy,He might come back.

Linebacker,We got us a crasher!
Lyrics,<I>I hate the way I am</I>
Xander,"(to the girls) So, have either of you seen a pair of girls  here? One's about so high... (notices the guys) Hey, guys!"
Tackle,New pledge.
Linebacker,New pledge!
Tackle,(grabs Xander and yells) New pledge!
Together,(dragging him off) New pledge! New pledge! New pledge! New  pledge! New pledge!
Tom,You okay?
Buffy,(drops the piece of glass and exhales) Yeah. I was... just  thinking.
Richard,To my Argentinean junk bonds that just matured into double  digits!
Tom,"Uh, to maturity."
Buffy,What the hell. I'm tired of being mature.
Willow,Bent.
Giles,Sent.
Willow,Rent.
Giles,"Uh, Lent. Dent."
Willow,Went. Kent. Kent! That's it!
Giles,Her boyfriend's name was Kent?
Willow,No! Kent Preparatory School. Just outside of town. That's where  I've seen these bracelets.
Giles,Wh-what are you doing?
Willow,Pulling up their school newsletter for the past few months. See  if there's anything about...
Giles,A missing girl.
Lyrics,"<I>Say what you say when you say what you've gotta say / Do you  fear what you hear are you gonna fear / Do you know what you know when  you gotta know / No, No, No</I>"
Tackle,"C'mon, dance, pretty boy!"
Tackle,"Keep it movin'! (laughs) C'mon! Shake it, don't break it! Wrap  it up and I'll take it!"
Xander,"(nervous) Okay, big fun guys. Uhhh, who's next?"
Tackle,"You are, doll face! Keep on dancin'! Ah, alright!"
Tackle,"Oh! Keep it up! Yes! C'mon! Keep it goin'! Ah, ha!"
Buffy,Tom?
Buffy,"Ooo! Ooo, sorry..."
Buffy,Okay. (crawls onto the bed) Nice bed. Just need to stop spinning  for at least...
Tom,Get away from her!
Richard,I wasn't doing anything!
Tom,I saw what you were doing.
Richard,I was just having a little fun.
Tom,"Well, she's not here for your fun, you pervert. She's here for the  pleasure of the one we serve."
Richard,(ashamed) In his name.
Tom,"And that goes for the other one, too."
Giles,"Callie Megan Anderson. Missing for over a week. No one's seen  her, no one knows what happened to her."
Willow,This being Sunnydale and all I guess we can rule out something  good.
Giles,I'm calling Buffy.
Willow,No!
Giles,Why not?
Willow,(nervous) Because Buffy... a-a-and her mother...
Giles,"Are sick. No, you're quite right. No, there's no point in  disturbing them until we know more."
Willow,"You mean, like, if there're others? Brittany Oswald, junior at  St. Michael's, disappeared a year ago. So did Kelly Percell, sophomore  at Grant."
Giles,A year.
Willow,Almost to the day.
Giles,An anniversary or perhaps some other event significant to the  killer.
Willow,Killer? Now there's a killer? We don't know that there's a...
Giles,"No, but this being Sunnydale and all."
Willow,Gulp.
Giles,"(exhales) We need to know where Buffy found that bracelet, and  then we can begin our search there. (reaches for the phone)"
Willow,"Good idea. Call Angel. (gets a confused look from Giles) Uh, he  was there when Buffy found it. We're gonna need all the help we can get."
Linebacker,"Party's over, jerkwater."
Xander,"Wait, a friend of mine was here."
Tackle,"Y'know, in that light, with that wig on and all... you're still  butt-ugly!"
Cordelia,Buffy? Where are we?
Buffy,"In the basement, far as I can tell."
Cordelia,What's happening? What did they do to us?
Buffy,They drugged us.
Cordelia,Why? What are they gonna do to us?
Buffy,I don't know.
Cordelia,(whines) I wanna go home.
Callie,"No one's going home. Ever. Look, one of them's different than  the others. (looks at Tom) Nicer."
Buffy,(whispers) Tom.
Callie,He's the one to watch out for.
Tom,She's last.
Cordelia,Last? For what?
Cordelia,Who's first?! Answer me! Who's first?!
Buffy,Three stones. (looks at Cordelia and Callie) Three of us.
Cordelia,(beginning to panic) Buffy...
Buffy,Stay calm. We'll get outta this.
Cordelia,Why'd I ever let you talk me into coming here?
Angel,She found the bracelet in the cemetery. Near the south wall.
Giles,South wall.
Giles,(to Willow) What are you doing?
Willow,"Oh! Sorry. The reflection thing that you don't have. Angel, how  do you shave? (the men exchange a look) South wall. That's near the  college and... the fraternity house!"
Giles,A fraternity?
Angel,Could they be taking these girls? (Willow nods again) Let's get  out there!
Willow,Buffy!
Giles,"Wwwe don't know that it's concrete. Uh, let's not disturb her  until..."
Willow,Is there! With Cordelia. They went to a party at the Zeta Kappa  house.
Giles,She lied to me?
Willow,(nervous) Well...
Angel,Did... she have a date?
Willow,"Well... (Angel huffs) Well, why do you think she went to that  party? Because you gave her the brush-off! (to Giles) And you never let  her do anything except work and patrol! And I know she's the Chosen One,  but you're killing her with the pressure! I mean, she's sixteen going on  forty! (to Angel) And you! I mean, you're gonna live forever! You don't  have time for a cup of coffee?!"
Willow,"Okay, I don't feel better now, and we've gotta help Buffy."
Xander,One day I'll have money. Prestige. Power. And on that day  they'll still have more.
Tom,Machida. (starts down)
Brothers,In his name.
Tom,"We who serve you, we who receive all that you bestow, call upon  you in this holy hour."
Brothers,In this holy hour.
Tom,"We have no wealth, no possession... except that which you give us."
Brothers,Except that which you give us.
Tom,"We have no power, no place in the world... except that which you  give us."
Brothers,Except that which you give us.
Cordelia,"What are they, some kind of cult or something?"
Buffy,"Yeah, a psycho cult."
Cordelia,You've gotta do something.
Tom,It's been a year since our last offering.
Tom,A year in which our bounty overflowed. We come before you with  fresh offerings.
Cordelia,Offerings? He's talking about us?
Callie,Do you see anyone else chained up in here?
Tom,"Accept our offering, Dark Lord, and bless us with your power.  Machida!"
Brothers,Machida!
Cordelia,(frightened) What's down there?
Tom,"Come forth, and let your terrible countenance look upon your  servants, and their humble offering. We call you, Machida."
Brothers,In his name. Machida.
Cordelia,There's something down there and he's gonna throw us down  there with it.
Buffy,I don't think so.
Cordelia,"No? Well, that's good! That, that's..."
Buffy,I don't think we go to it. I think it comes to us.
Cordelia,(terrified) Ooohhhhhhh! No!
Cordelia,"Oh, my God! (screams)"
Cordelia,"C'mon, Buffy! Oh, my God! Oh, c'mon! Oh!"
Tom,"For he shall rise from the depths, and we shall tremble before  him."
Tom,He who is the source of all we inherit and all we possess.  Machida.
Brothers,Machida.
Tom,"And if he is pleased with our offerings, then our fortune shall  increase."
Brothers,Machida. Let our fortunes increase.
Tom,And on the tenth day of the tenth month he shall be enhungered.  And we shall feed him.
Cordelia,Feed him?
Cordelia,Feed him?!
Cordelia,"Oh, no!"
Willow,Looks like everyone's gone.
Angel,Hey!
Xander,Hey! (lifts the hood from his eyes) What are you guys doing  here?
Willow,"A bunch of girls are missing, and the Zeta Kappas may be  involved, and Buffy. Are you wearing makeup?"
Xander,No. I think Buffy's still inside somewhere with Cordelia. Her  car's still here.
Giles,Why are you wearing that? (indicates the robe)
Xander,"Oh, I found it in their trash. I saw them through the window.  They were wearing robes and went down to the basement. I was gonna use  it to sneak in."
Giles,They may be involved in some kind of ritual.
Willow,With the missing girls.
Angel,"(growls, vamped out) With Buffy!"
Xander,"Okay, that *is* the guy you wanna party with."
Buffy,"Hey, reptile boy! (gets his attention)"
Tom,No woman speaks to him!
Buffy,You don't want her. Look at her. She's all skin and bones. Half  an hour later you'll be hungry.
Tom,(comes over to Buffy) I told you to shut up!
Tom,You speak again and I'll cut your throat.
Xander,"Got locked out dumping the trash. Let me in. I don't wanna miss  the, uh..."
Tackle,Come on.
Xander,...you know what. (throws back his hood) Where are they?!
Tom,Something's going on upstairs. (to the brothers) Go. Go!
Tom,"Feed, Dark Lord!"
Xander,That's for the wig! (punches again) That's for the bra!
Willow,Some guy's attacking Buffy with a sword! Also there's a really  big snake!
Xander,"That's for the makeup! (punches again, knocking him out) And  that's for the last sixteen and a half years!"
Willow,Guys! Buffy! Snake! Basement! Now!
Tom,You bitch! I'll serve you to him in pieces.
Buffy,"Tom, you talk too much."
Buffy,"Let her go, wormy!"
Cordelia,You did it! You saved us! (grabs Angel in a tight hug) I've  never been so happy to see anyone in my whole... (lets go) You guys.  (cries) I just... hate you guys! The weirdest things always happen when  you're around!
Cordelia,And you! You're going to jail for fifteen thousand years!
Buffy,"I told one lie, I had one drink."
Giles,"Yes, and you were very nearly devoured by a giant demon snake.  The words 'let that be a lesson' are a tad redundant at this juncture."
Buffy,I'm sorry. (looks at him for forgiveness)
Giles,"So am I. I... I drive you too hard because I-I know what you  have to face. From now on no, no more pushing, no more prodding. Just,  uh, an inordinate amount of nudging."
Jonathon,"C'mon, hurry!"
Barmaid,Here you go.
Cordelia,"Thank you, Jonathon. (looks at the cappuccino) Did we forget  something?"
Jonathon,"Um... Cinnamon, chocolate, half-caf, nonfat."
Jonathon,Extra foam!
Cordelia,Young men are the only way to go. (leaves)
Xander,Says here that they've all been sentenced to consecutive life  sentences. Investigators found the bones of missing girls in a huge  cavern beneath the frat house. And older bones dating back fifty years.
Xander,"A surprising number of corporations whose chairmen and founders  are former Delta Zeta Kappas are suffering from falling profits, IRS  raids... Ooo, and suicides in the boardroom. Hmm. Starve a snake, lose a  fortune. Boy, I guess the rich really are different, huh?"
Willow,"(to Buffy) Have you heard from Angel? When he got so mad about  you being in danger, and changed into a (makes a face) grr, it was the  most amazing thing I ever saw. I mean, how many guys can..."
Xander,"Angel, Angel, Angel. Does every conversation we have have to  come around to that freak? (notices Angel) Hey, man, how you doin'?"
Angel,Buffy.
Buffy,Angel.
Xander,(in a deep voice) Xander! (shakes his head)
Angel,"I hear this place, uh, serves coffee. (Xander looks up at him) I  thought maybe you and I should get some. Sometime. If you want."
Buffy,Yeah. Sometime. I'll let you know.
