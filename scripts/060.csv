60,"""Fear, Itself"" Transcript"
Buffy,"“Parker, did I do something wrong?”"
Parker,“Didn’t you have fun?”
Buffy,“Is that all it was?”
Parker,“What else was it supposed to be?”
Buffy,"“He’s manipulative and shallow, and why doesn’t he want me?”"
Willow,“I think you’re missing something about the whole poop-head principle.”
Xander,“Hi again.”
Xander,"“I don’t know, I was going for ferocious, scary, but it’s coming out more dryly sardonic.”"
Willow,“It does appear to be mocking you with its eye holes.”
Oz,“The nose hole seems sad and full of self-loathing.”
bed,"“What do you think, Buff?”"
Buffy,"“I was just thinking about the life of a pumpkin.  Grow up in the sun - happily entwined with others, then someone comes along, cuts you open and - rips your guts out.”"
Xander,"“Okay, and on that happy note, I’ve got a treat for tomorrow nights second annual Halloween screening.  People - prepare to have your spines tingled, your gooses bumped by the terrifying (Pulls out a video and reads the title) Fantasia.  Fantasia?”"
Oz,"“Maybe it’s because of all the - horrific things we’ve seen, but hippos wearing tutus just don’t unnerve me the way they used to.”"
Xander,“Phantasm.  It was supposed to be ‘Phantasm”.  Stupid video store!”
Willow,“I thought we were doing the alph delt thing.”
Xander,“What thing?”
Buffy,“The scary house?  Sounds kinda lame.”
Oz,“It actually borders on fun.  You have to go through the scary house maze to get to the party.  Which is usually worth getting to.  Those guys go all out.”
Willow,“As witnessed last Friday.”
Oz,“Very true.”
Xander,“There is a party?”
Willow,“We didn’t tell you?”
Xander,"“No, it’s cool.  You guys got your little college thing.  I’m fine.  I mean, I got better things to do than tag along to some Fraternity.”"
Willow,“You can come.”
Xander,“Okay.  But only because I lied about having better things to do.”
Oz,“A blast will be had by all.”
up,“I’m gonna get going.”
Xander,"“Now?  Tonight’s still...(Looks at his watch) okay, it’s a little mature, but still.”"
Buffy,“I’m sleepy.  You guys have fun.”
Willow,“You want me to come with?”
leaves,“No I’m fine.”
head,“Sad Buffy.”
Willow,“She didn’t even touch her pumpkin.  It’s a freak with no face.”
Oz,“She’s still suffering a little post-Parker depression.”
Xander,“Bailing on the Buff.  Does anyone else want to smack that guy?”
Kid,"“Jeez, that hurt!  What the hell is wrong with you, lady?”"
Buffy,“That’s what I’d like to know.”
Willow,"“I’ve got the basics down – levitation, charms, glamours.  I just feel like I’ve plateaued wicca-wise.”"
Buffy,“What’s the next level?”
Willow,"“Transmutation, conjuring, bringing forth something from nothing.  Gets pretty close to the primal forces.  A little scary.”"
Buffy,"“Well, no one’s pushing.  You know, if it’s too much don’t do it.”"
Willow,“Don’t do it?  What kind of encouragement is *that*?”
Buffy,“This is an ‘encouragement’ talk?  I thought it was ‘share my pain’.”
Willow,"“I don’t know.  Then again, what is college for if not experimenting?  You know, maybe I can handle it.  I’ll know when I’ve reached my limit.”"
them,“Wine coolers?”
Buffy,“Magic.”
Oz,"“Ooh, you didn’t encourage her, did you?”"
Willow,“Where is supportive boyfriend guy?”
Oz,"“He’s picking up your dry cleaning, but he told me to tell you that he’s afraid you’re gonna get hurt.”"
smile,"“Okay, Brutus.  (Oz just looks at her)  Brutus – Caesar?  (Willow looks form Oz to Buffy)  Betrayal – trusted friend?  (Makes stabbing motions with her banana)  Back stabby?”"
Oz,"“Oh, I’m with you on the reference, but – I won’t lie about the fact that I worry?  I know what it’s like to have power you can’t control.  I mean, every time I start to wold out, I touch something –deep – dark.  It’s not fun.  But just know that what ever you decide, I back your play.”"
Buffy,"“See?  Concerned boy, sweet boy.”"
Willow,“I kinda like him - worrying anyway.”
Buffy,"“You know I, uhm, I forgot – to (puts her food down and turns to leave) be hungry.”"
her,"“Wait, Buffy.”"
hallway,“Buffy.  Don’t let jerky Parker chase you away.”
Buffy,"“He didn’t.  I just don’t want to deal with this right now.  I’m taking a holiday from dealing, happily vacationing in the land of not coping.”"
Willow,"“You know what, you’ll feel better at the party tonight.  Maybe you’ll even meet someone.”"
Buffy,"“Willow, I don’t want to meet someone.  I’ve reached my quota on someones.  Besides, I think I’m gonna have to patrol anyway.”"
Willow,"“Tonight, but – it’s Halloween!”"
Buffy,"“I’ll double check with Giles, but I’m sure he’s going to think I should be on active Slayer duty.  He doesn’t care about Halloween.”"
Giles,"“Happy Hallow - Hello, Buffy?”"
him,“Oh – my – God.”
Giles,“It’s a sombrero.”
Buffy,“And it’s on your head.”
Giles,"“It seemed festive.  Uhm, come in. (Buffy comes in) Candy?”"
decorations,“What’s going on here?  You hate Halloween.”
Giles,"“I never said any such a thing.  As my Watcher’s duties took precedence, I simply haven’t taken time to – well, to embrace its inherent charms – until now.  (Turns on a Frankenstein puppet hanging from the ceiling)  Look, look! (Laughs)  It’s alive! (Buffy just stares at him)  See – how he shakes?  -  Is – is there something you wanted?”"
Buffy,"“I was thinking that I should patrol tonight.  You know, possibly the cemetery or if you had a better su... (Stares distractedly at the fringe dangling from the edge of his sombrero) could you please take that off?”"
candy,"“Oh, yes, of course.  (Takes the hat off)  I see, is there some specific danger you were sensing?”"
Buffy,"“No.  But then you know we were all caught of guard when Ethan turned everyone into their costumes."""
Giles,"“True, but what happened then was anomalous.  Creatures of the night shy away form Halloween.  They find it all much too crass.”"
Buffy,“Hard to believe.”
Giles,"“Well, I-I promise you - there is little likelihood of any supernatural activity tonight. (Holds up the bowl of Candy)  You sure you don’t want one?”"
skeleton,“I come bearing spiders.”
Guy,“The sound system is not going to cut it.  Nothing but lame.”
Guy,“You want me to call Oz?  He can probably hook us up.”
Guy,"“Do it.  If we not scare the young women, they will not fall into our arms. - We’ll have woman-less arms.  Halloween isn’t about thrills, chills and funny costumes, it’s about getting laid.”"
Guy,“Is there any holiday that’s not about getting laid?”
Guy,"“Arborday.  Call Oz, dude.”"
Guy,"“Done.  And oh, you wanted a symbol to paint upstairs, something mystical?  (Holds up a book with a pentagram in it) Check this out.”"
Xander,“Anya?  You really have to get this knocking thing down.  -  How did you...?”
Anya,“You’re uncle Rory let me in.  Does he always smell like peppermint?”
Xander,“The man likes his schnapps.  What are you doing here?”
Anya,“You haven’t called.  Not once.”
Xander,“You said you were over me.”
Anya,“And you just accepted that?  I only said that because I thought that’s what you wanted to hear.”
Xander,"“That’s the funny thing about me, I tend to hear the actual words people say and accept them at face value.”"
Anya,“That’s stupid.”
Xander,“I accept that.  -  I can’t say seeing you falls into the realm of a bad thing.”
smiles,"“Really?  -  I thought - maybe we could go out tonight, for our anniversary.”"
Xander,“Anniversary?”
Anya,“It’s been exactly one week since we copulated. - Did you forget?”
Xander,"“Oh, no, of course not.  It’s just I already have plans with Buffy, Willow and Oz.  It’s Halloween, you know.”"
Anya,“I don’t understand.”
Xander,"“Well, every October 31st, we mortals dress up in masks...”"
Anya,"“No, no, I understand that inane ritual.  It’s those people.  You continue to associate with them though you share little in common.”"
Xander,“What are you talking about?”
Anya,"“I mean they go to college, you don’t.  They no longer live at home, - you do.”"
Xander,"“Oh, hey, those things...  The bonds of true friendship transcends...  Could we just change the subject?”"
Anya,"“Okay, okay.  Don’t get upset with me.  I just wondered.”"
Xander,“If you want you can come with me tonight to this party.”
Anya,“You mean like a date? - Is that what this is? (Xander swallows) Are we dating?”
Xander,"“There are definitely date-like qualities at work here. – Oh, you’ll need a costume.”"
Anya,“A costume?”
Xander,"“Dress up, you know, something - scary.”"
Anya,“Scary.  Scary how?”
Xander,"“Anya, you ex-demon, terrorized mankind for centuries.  I’m sure you’ll come up with something.”"
Buffy,"“Excuse me, Professor Walsh?  I came to get today’s assignments.  I, uh, couldn’t make it to class for personal reasons.”"
Walsh,"“Right.  I count four limbs, a head no visible scarring, so I assume your personal issue wasn’t a life threatening accident of any kind, I’m therefore uninterested.  You got problems, solve them on your own time.  Miss another class and you’re out.”"
Riley,"“She means it, you know.”"
Buffy,“Yeah.  I got the impression she wasn’t saying it to make me laugh.”
Riley,“You’ve got to be aware your work’s taken a little down turn lately.  I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen your hand up.”
Buffy,“Does stretching count?”
Riley,"“Look, things get pretty intense Freshmen year, - as I dimly recall.  Too much fun or not enough?”"
beat,“Both actually.”
assignments,"“Yeah, well, you just got to keep your priorities.  Prof. Walsh is worth your time.”"
Buffy,"“Thanks, I’ll get this done tonight.”"
Riley,"“Tonight.  It’s Halloween!  What, your not going to dress up and go party?”"
Buffy,“I have a lot of work to do.”
Riley,"“I may be out of line here, and it’s not really my business, but - you seem like the kind of person that makes things really hard on themselves.  Halloween isn’t a night for responsibility.  It’s when the ghosts and goblins come out.”"
Buffy,“That’s actually a misnomer.”
Riley,"“Well, I didn’t mean real ones.  (Buffy smiles and looks down)  But, hey, there is some good scary fun to be had on campus tonight.”"
Buffy,“Yeah?  What are you doing?”
Riley,"“Well, I’m going to sit here and grade papers.”"
go,“Scary.”
Riley,“Very.”
Buffy,"“Well, thanks for the pep talk, coach.”"
Riley,“Don’t make fun.  I worked long and hard to get this pompous.”
Buffy,"“No, I mean it.”"
beat,“You’re welcome.”
Guy,"“Okay, watch your step, boys.  Paint’s still wet in a few spots.”"
Guy,"“Thanks for the loan, man.  Our sound system sucks.”"
Oz,“Mi casio es su casio.”
pentagram,"“Well, that’s an interesting little design.  What does it mean?”"
Guy,“No - clue.  I got it out of this book.  There is a lot of really cool stuff about...”
table,"“Ooh, grapes! (Picks up a grape)  Wow, peeled.  You guys know how to spoil your guests.”"
Guy,"“Eyeballs, man.  Blindfold chicks and have them stick their hands in the bowl and tell them it’s eyeballs.  They love that.”"
Xander,"“And here I was wasting time buying them flowers and complimenting them on their shoes.  So, you go through the whole house of horrors downstairs and it ends up here.  Sweet.  You fratly guys have a nice setup.”"
Guy,"“Hey, mighty, mighty Alpha Delts.  You should think about pledging.”"
Oz,"“Oh, Xander is a civilian.”"
Guy,"“Ah!  Townie, huh?  Didn’t know.  He looked so normal.  You sure we should let him come to the party, Oz?”"
Xander,"“Hey, standing right here.”"
Guy,“Cranking.”
Oz,"“You’re sensing a disturbance in the force, master?”"
pocketknife,"“Ah, the left speaker is crackling a little bit.”"
Xander,“And you feel stabbing it is the proper solution?”
Oz,“I’m just going to trim the wire.  It might be a short.”
up,“Ah!”
Xander,“Oz?”
Oz,“Cut myself.  It’s okay.”
Xander,"“Playing with knives, fun, yes, but not safe.  And when you bleed to death I’ve got dibs on your equipment.”"
Buffy,“Thanks again for doing this at the last minute.”
Joyce,“I’m just glad I could find it. There. Try it now.  I let down the hem and loosened it a little around the hood.”
on,"“Oh, it feels better.  (Joyce smiles at her) Oh, no.  Someone is getting nostalgic face.”"
Joyce,“I’m sorry.  I’m thinking about the little girl who wore that.  What is it?  Five?  Six years ago.”
Buffy,"“Yeah, little red riding hood was the cutting edge in costumes.”"
laughs,“Your father *loved* to take you out.”
Buffy,“He was such a pain!  12 years old and I can’t go trick-or-treating by myself?”
Joyce,“He just wanted to keep you safe.”
Buffy,"“No, he wanted the candy.  I was just the beard.”"
Joyce,"“Oh, that’s not true actually.  The candy was for me.  -  Your father loved spending time with you.”"
down,"“Not enough, I guess.”"
Joyce,“Buffy.”
Buffy,"“Oh, that just paved right over memory lane, huh?”"
Joyce,“Our divorce had nothing to do with you.”
swallows,"“I don’t know. – I’m starting to feel like there is a pattern here. – Open your heart to someone, and he bails on you.  Maybe it’s easier to just not let anyone in.”"
up,“I thought it might be easier.  You must have noticed that I am not exactly the social butterfly I was when I was with your dad.  I don’t think I made a single new friend the year we moved to Sunnydale.”
Buffy,“Why not?”
Joyce,"“Fear.  I didn’t believe I could trust anyone again.  It’s taken time and a lot of effort, but I’ve got a nice circle of friends now.  -  I mean, don’t get me wrong.  I – I’m still a little gun shy.  It certainly didn’t help that my last boyfriend turned out to be a homicidal robot.  (Sits down next to Buffy)  I will *always* be here for you.  And you got Mr. Giles and your friends.  (Buffy looks at her)  Believe me, there is nothing to be afraid of.”"
phone,"“No, I just meet you at your place. – Yeah, Buffy said she was coming but I haven’t seen her.  We have to make sure she has fun.  We have to force fun upon her.  And if Parker shows up we just - ax-murder him.  That’s halloweeny!  Okay, I’ll see you in a little bit.”"
her,"“Willow, you’ve got to stop by the room.”"
Willow,“I’m late for a battle or I would.  I love your outfit though.”
Lobster,“There is nothing going on here.”
Present,“I saw you flirting with her!”
Lobster,"“Do we have to do this every time?  I love you, you know that!”"
grapes,"“Okay, Rach, what’s in the next one?”"
Rachel,“You guys are sick!”
Guy,"“Here, give me your hand.”"
bowl,“This is gross.”
Guy,"“Eyeballs, Rachel, they’re eyeballs! Muahaha!”"
Xander,"“Hey, Red.  What you got in the basket, little girl?”"
Buffy,“Weapons.’
Xander,“Oh.”
Buffy,"“Just in case.  Like the tux, Xander.”"
Xander,"“Bond.  James Bond.  Insurance, you know, in case we get turned into our costumes again.  I’m going for cool, secret agent guy.”"
Buffy,"“I hate to break it to you, but you’ll probably end up cool head waiter guy.”"
Xander,“As long as I’m cool and wield some kind of power.”
Buffy,“Will.  Medieval Will.”
Xander,"“Hail, ye olde – vareletty – thou.”"
Willow,"“I’m Joan of Arc.  I figured we had a lot in common, seeing as how - I was almost burned at the stake, and plus she had - that close relationship with God.”"
Oz,“And you are?”
together,“Of course.  I wish I’d thought of that before I put down my deposit.  I could have been God.”
Oz,“Blasphemer.”
Buffy,“Nice costumes.  Very stealthy.”
Willow,“What are they supposed to be?”
Oz,“NATO?”
Xander,"“Oh, yeah, I, ah, invited Anya to join us, but she’s having some trouble finding a scary costume, so she’s just going to meet us there.”"
Buffy,"“Perfect, everybody’s got a date but third-wheel Buffy.”"
Willow,“You’re not a third wheel.”
Xander,“Technically speaking you’re a fifth wheel.”
Buffy,“We’re going to have the best time.”
rumbles,“Release me!”
door,“Let the horrors begin.”
corridor,"“God, help me!”"
rumbles,“Release me!”
Xander,“The joint’s not jumping.  Where is everybody?”
Oz,“Follow the signs.”
head,“Terrifying.  If I were Abbott and Costello this would be fairly traumatic.”
screams,"“Uh, ah! Cobweb!  (Pulls it off of her)  Okay that part was realistic.”"
Oz,“Frat boys aren’t too obsessive with their cleaning.  Might not be decoration per se.”
panting,"“I wasn’t scared, I was in the spirit.”"
Willow,“And we back you up on that.  Even if they question us separately.”
screams,"“Uh, get it off!”"
over,“It is gone.”
Willow,"“Okay, that is not sanitary!”"
Buffy,"“Yeah, lets get to the party part of the – party.”"
Oz,“Are you sure it’s off?”
Buffy,“Yeah.”
Oz,“I thought this led to...”
Buffy,“What is it?”
fingers,“Blood.  (Smells her fingers) Real blood.”
Xander,"“Okay, actual creeps have been given. (Loudly) Bravo, frat boys!”"
up,“Shh!  Do you hear something?  Like a - squeaking noise?”
Xander,"“Oh, it’s these rented shoes, patent leather.  I asked the guy to...”"
Willow,"“No, no, I – wait.  It’s something else.  I hear it, too.  Something like...”"
Willow,"“No, Oz, don’t it might be...”"
Oz,“Rubber.  It’s made of rubber.”
around,“What the hell is going on here?”
Xander,"“Look, maybe it’s nothing.  Maybe it’s just a neat trick.  You know, something done with wires or...”"
voice,“Release me!”
Xander,“Or it might be something else.”
Anya,“Where is the door?  (Knocks on the wall)  Hey!  Hello!”
Girl,“Help me!  Help me!”
go,“Xander!”
Xander,“Where is the stairs?”
Willow,“Where is the door?”
Buffy,"“This is the way we came in, right?  We just went in a circle? (The sound effects cut off as Oz flips a switch)  Thank the lord!”"
Oz,“You’re welcome.”
Willow,"“Hey, I have a neat idea: lets get out of here!”"
Buffy,“And you were so anxious for me to come.”
Willow,"“I’m serious, Buffy.  We don’t know what we’re dealing with.”"
Xander,“My turn.  Does anyone hear that?”
Buffy,“As soon as we start dealing with it I’ll know what it is we’re dealing with.  Do you hear something?”
Xander,“Like I said.  Sounds like a hissing.”
basket,“It’s like a ‘ssss’ noise?”
Xander,“I thought the word hissing kind of covered that nicely.”
Chaz,“I’m sorry.  I didn’t know.  I’m sorry.”
him,“Chaz.”
Chaz,“I didn’t know.”
Oz,“What’s happening?”
harder,“It ah...”
impatiently,“What is it?”
Chaz,“It’s alive.  It’s alive.”
Buffy,“What’s alive?”
Xander,“He’s in shock.”
Buffy,"“Chaz, what happened here?”"
Buffy,“I think the cape took most of it.’
Xander,“Let me see.”
Oz,“Could need stitches.  You should at least get a bandage or something.”
Oz,“Cowering in a closet is starting to seem like a reasonable plan.”
shoulder,“What closet?  (There is only a blank wall) I’m gonna make my way upstairs and see if there are any people up there. (Picks up her basket)  You guys find a way out of the house and use it.”
Willow,“You’re telling us to run away and leave you behind?”
out,“We need help.  We need the only person that can make sense of what’s happening.”
candy,“Just a minute!  -  Coming! (Opens the door)  Happy Hall...”
him,"“Xander is in trouble.  We’ve got to do something, right now!”"
open,“Anya.”
Anya,“Are you listening?  Xander is trapped!”
Giles,"“Uh, ah, where is Buffy and the others?”"
Anya,"“They’re trapped, too, but we’ve got to save Xander!”"
down,“Slow down.  I need you to be more specific.”
Anya,"“Uhm, ah, we were supposed to meet at this house, and I got there and there was no door where a door should be.  And then I see this girl standing in a window, and then poof!  She’s gone.’"
Giles,“She vanished from the window?”
Anya,"“No, the window vanished from the house.”"
Giles,“Hmm.  Matter and reality distortion. (Goes and pulls a book from his shelf) Like a summoning spell’s temporal flux.”
Anya,“What?”
Giles,"“Hmm?  Oh, never mind.  I just need to get some - supplies together.  (Looks over at Anya)  I wouldn’t worry about Xander.  At least he’s amongst friends.”"
Buffy,"“Will, I’m telling you...”"
Willow,“You’re telling me?  You’re telling me?!?”
Buffy,“I can’t do my job if I have to worry about each of your safety.”
Willow,“It’s not your decision!”
Buffy,“Got to disagree with you there.”
Willow,"“Oh, of course you do.”"
Xander,"“Let’s all take a breath.  Buffy, maybe...”"
Willow,“Being the Slayer doesn’t automatically make you boss.  You’re as lost as the rest of us.”
Oz,“What are we talking about?”
Willow,"“It’s a simple incantation, a guiding spell for travelers when they become lost or disoriented.”"
Buffy,“And how does it work?”
Willow,“It conjures an emissary from the beyond that – lights the way.”
Buffy,"“Conjuring.  Will, let’s be realistic here.  Okay, your basic spells are usually only fifty-fifty.”"
upset,"“Oh yeah?  Well, - so is your face!”"
meant,“What?!  (Walks after Willow)  What does that mean?”
around,“I’m not your sidekick!”
Xander,"“Well, that was a bunch of laughs.  (Buffy walks past him back to her basket)  Look, Buffy, we are all tired and a *little* edgy.  Maybe Willow is over reacting.  I’m sure part of it is because of how you’ve been ‘pushing away’ girl lately.  (Buffy picks up her crossbow, ignoring him totally)  But now is not the time to let that stuff tear us apart.  (Buffy turns to go)  What I’m saying is, I’m right with ya.  I’m right by your side.  I’m...”"
around,“Xander?”
Xander,“Funny how you still haven’t lost your sense of inappropriate humor.”
him,"“Xander, where did you go?”"
Xander,"“Buffy, knock it off. Skit’s over.  I’m right here.”"
hall,“This is so *typical* of him!”
Xander,“Typical?”
hall,“Xander?”
beat,“Buffy!”
Xander,“Buff?”
Willow,“She thinks I’m not ready to be a full blown witch!  I can handle the dark forces as good as anyone else.  It’s not that hard.  I-It’s just a guiding spell and I’m careful and all.”
into,“This floor used to have windows.”
Willow,"“Look.  We found the stairs.  (Starts walking up)  Buffy didn’t find the stairs, no sir!”"
stairs,“You guys aren’t thinking clearly.”
corridor,“We just need to get up to the goat room and maybe we can...”
Oz,"“Willow, something is happening.”"
him,"“Something good? (Sees that he is turning into a werewolf)  Oh, no – not good.”"
Oz,“I’m changing.”
Willow,“But – but you can’t!  There is no moon tonight.”
Oz,“I have to get away.”
Willow,"“No, we need to find something to restrain you, like a rope or chains, or something.”"
Oz,“There is no time!”
Willow,“I can do the guiding spell.  I know I can make it work!”
Oz,"“Will, please.”"
him,“No!”
growl,“NO!”
Willow,"“Oz! – Oz, don’t leave me!”"
echoing,“Don’t leave me!  Don’t leave me!”
mirror,“There I am.  I didn’t go anywhere.  (He looks at his reflection in the mirror.  We can see a decapitated head with one eyeball hanging from its socket sitting on a dresser behind him) Great.  Now I just have to live with the fact that no one else can see me.”
Head,“I can see you.”
over,“You’re not going to change.  You’re not going to change.”
table,"“Okay, Aradia, Goddess of the lost, the path is murky, the woods are dense, darkness pervades, I beseech thee, bring the light.  (She opens her eyes and smiles as she sees a tiny speck of light floating in front of her face)  Woah!  I did it!  I did you.  Hi!  -  Right, you’re waiting for instructions.  Lead me to Oz. (The speck of light starts to float past her, and Willow gets up) Wait!  I should try to find the people trapped upstairs first. (Willow looks down and doesn’t see that there are now two then three sparks)  But even if I get them we still need to find a way out of the house.  (They spark keep multiplying)  Okay, here is what we should do.  (Sees the cloud of sparks)  Hey!  What’s going on?  (The sparks start to circle her)  Stop! (Willow starts to bat at them as they start to buzz around her like a cloud of mosquitoes) Stop it! - Get off! - Oz, hel..”"
Buffy,“Willow.”
Buffy,“Basement.  -  I must be in the basement.”
voice,“All alone.”
up,“Who said - that?”
Guy,"“They all ran away from you.  They always will.  Open your heart to someone and  (Smiles at her) – But don’t fret, little girl, you’re not alone (Buffy screams as arms burst up through the floor to grab at her) anymore.”"
impatiently,“Well?’
Giles,“We’re gonna have to create a door.”
Anya,“Create a door.  You can do that?”
hands,“I can.”
guy,"“No matter how hard you fight, you just end up in the same place.  (Buffy crawls along the floor on all fours, kicking at the guys following her)  I don’t see why you bother.”"
Buffy,“I’m upstairs.  The goat room.”
corner,“Oz?”
around,“Get them off me!  Get them off me!  (Oz looks at his normal hands then up at her)  Get’em off!  Get’em off!”
her,"“Willow, Willow, Willow, what’s wrong?”"
Willow,“Couldn’t get them off..”
Oz,“It’s okay.  It’s okay.  (Pulls her into his arms) We’re okay.”
head,“We’re not okay.  We need to get out of here.”
Xander,"“I’d offer *my* opinion but you jerks aren’t gonna hear it anyway. (Buffy walks over to where he is rocking back and forth on the edge of a chair) Not that ‘didn’t go to college’ boy has anything important to say.  I might as well hang out my new best friend, bleeding dummy head, for all you dorks care.”"
yells,“What is wrong with you?”
up,"“You – you heard that?  You – you can see me?  (Buffy nods)  Good.  Oh, God, good!”"
Oz,“The house separated us.  It wanted to scare us.”
Willow,“But - we got away.”
Buffy,“No.  We were brought here.  We all got so scared that we ended up here. – Why?”
floor,“I saw them painting that.  They were copying it out of  (Looks around and spots the open book on a table) that!”
him,“I think it’s Gaelic.”
Buffy,“Can you translate?”
voice,“Release me!  (They all look around but there is nothing there)  Release me!”
Buffy,"“Will, give me something.”"
Willow,"“Okay, uhm, uhm, the icon’s called the-the Mark of Gachnar.  I-I think this is a summoning spell for something called..”"
Xander,“Gachnar?”
Willow,"“Well, yes.  Somehow the beginning of the spell must have been triggered.  Uhm, Gachnar is trying to manifest itself, to-to come into being.”"
Buffy,“How?”
Willow,“I-it feeds on fear.”
Buffy,“Our fears are manifesting it.  We’re feeding it.  We need to stop.”
Xander,“If we’re close our eyes and say it’s a dream it’ll stab us to death!  These things are real.”
voice,“Release me!”
Buffy,"“Okay, so our fears are feeding it, if we get everyone out of here..”"
Xander,“Good plan.  Lets go!”
Xander,"“Giles?  Everyone, it’s Giles!  With a *chainsaw*. (Anya runs in and hugs Xander) Glad you could make it.”"
Giles,"“The walls closed up behind us.  (Walks over and takes a look at Willow’s book) Gachnar, of course.  It’s presence infects the reality of the house, but it’s not managed to achieve full manifestation.  We can not allow this to come into being.”"
Buffy,"“But if it does I can fight it, right?”"
book,"“Buffy, this is Gachnar.”"
Buffy,"“I *don’t* want to fight that.  So, we break the spell.”"
Xander,"“What ever we do, lets do it fast.”"
pages,"“I have it, I have it. Uhm, ‘The summoning spell for Gachnar can be shut down in one of two ways.  Destroying the mark of Gachnar  (Buffy walks over to the mark and puts her fist through it, ripping up the floorboards.  Gets up and looks over at Giles with a proud smile) – Is *not* one of them and will in fact immediately bring forth the fear demon itself.”"
Willow,“Look!”
Buffy,“This is Gachnar?”
Xander,“Big overture.  Little show.”
Gachnar,“I am the dark lord of nightmares!  (Buffy tries not to laugh) The bringer of terror!  Tremble before me.  Fear me!”
laughing,“He – he’s no cute!”
Gachnar,“Tremble!”
down,“Who’s a little fear demon?  Come on!  Who’s a little fear demon!”
Giles,“Don’t taunt the fear demon.”
Xander,"“Why, can he hurt me?”"
Giles,"“No, it’s just – tacky.  Be that as it may, Buffy, when it comes to slaying...”"
Buffy,“Size doesn’t matter?”
Gachnar,"“They’re all going to abandon you, you know.”"
Buffy,"“Yeah, Yeah.”"
Oz,"“Some quality treats here, Giles.”"
Giles,"“*Please*, finish them.”"
Buffy,"“Uhm, this is much better.  There is no problem that can not be solved with chocolate.”"
stomach,“I think I’m going to barf.”
Buffy,“Except that.”
Anya,“What?”
Xander,“That’s your scary costume?”
Anya,“Bunnies frighten me.”
Giles,"“Oh, bloody hell.  The inscription!”"
Buffy,“What’s the matter?”
book,“I should have translated the Gaelic inscription under the illustration of Gachnar.”
it,“What’s it say?”
Giles,“Actual size.”
