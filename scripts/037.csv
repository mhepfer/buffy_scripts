Willow,(smiling) I'm giddy.
Oz,"Oh, I like you giddy. Always have."
Willow,"It's the freedom! As Seniors, we can go off-campus now for  lunch. It's no longer cutting. It's legal! Heck, it's expected! Wow,  it's, uh, also a big step forward, a Senior moment, one that has to be  savored."
Willow,"You can't just rush into this, you know?"
Willow,Ohh!
Willow,"No, I can't!"
Xander,You can.
Oz,"See, you are."
Willow,"Oh, but, no! What if they changed the rule without telling?  What if they're lying in wait to *arrest* me a-and, and throw me in  detention and mar my unblemished record?"
Xander,Breathe. Breathe.
Willow,Okay. Hmm...
Willow,"(relaxed) This is good! This is... Hey, we're Seniors! (with an  attitude) Hey, I'm walkin' here! (giggles)"
Xander,Ahh. Buffy and food.
Willow,Maybe we shouldn't be too couple-y around Buffy.
Cordelia,"Oh, you mean 'cause of how the only guy that ever liked her  turned into a vicious killer and had to be put down like a dog?"
Xander,"(admiringly) Can she cram complex issues into a nutshell, or  what?"
Oz,"All right, prepare to uncouple..."
Oz,Uncouple.
Xander,"Buffy, banned from campus, but not from our hearts, how are you  and what's for lunch?"
Buffy,"Oh, I just threw a few things together."
Cordelia,(impressed with Buffy's offerings) When did you become Martha  Stewart?
Buffy,"First of all, Martha Stewart knows jack about hand-cut  prosciutto. (hands out drink bottles)"
Xander,"I don't believe she slays, either."
Oz,"Oh, I hear she can, but she doesn't like to."
Buffy,"(opens her bottle) Second of all, way too much free time on my  hands since I got kicked out of school. (takes a drink)"
Willow,"Oh, I know they'll let you back in. (takes a drink)"
Xander,Don't you and your mom have a meeting with Principal Snyder?
Buffy,We're seeing Snyde-Man tomorrow.
Willow,"(notices a boy) Ooo, Scott Hope at eleven o'clock. (Buffy  looks) (to Buffy) He likes you. He wanted to ask you out last year, but  you weren't ready then. But I think you're ready now, or at least in the  state of pre-readiness to make conversation, or-or to do that thing with  your mouth that boys like."
Willow,"(realizes her slip-up) Oh! I didn't mean the *bad* thing with  your mouth, I meant that little half-smile thing that you... (glares at  Oz) You're supposed to stop me when I do that."
Oz,(smiles and shakes his head) I like when you do that.
Scott,"(smiles) Hi, Buffy."
Buffy,(smiles back) Hi.
Willow,I think that went very well. Don't you think that went very  well?
Cordelia,He didn't try to slit our throats or anything. (nods) That's  progress.
Willow,"Hey, did you do that little half-smile thing?"
Buffy,"(sighs) Look, I'm not trying to snare Scott Hope. I just want to  get my life back, you know, do normal stuff."
Willow,Like date?
Buffy,Well...
Xander,"Oh, you wanna date. I saw that half-smile, you little slut.  (chuckles)"
Xander,(smiles and chuckles) Ow. (winces and holds his arm)
Buffy,"All right, yes, date and shop and hang out and go to school and  save the world from unspeakable demons. You know, I wanna do girlie  stuff!"
Voice,"Welcome to Happy Burger. May I take your order, please?"
Trick,Diet soda. Medium.
Voice,"That'll be eighty-nine cents at the window, sir."
Trick,"Sunnydale. (looks at the man next to him) Town's got quaint. And  the people? (smiles) He called me 'sir'. Don't you just miss that? I  mean, admittedly, it's not a haven for the brothers, you know, strictly  the Caucasian Persuasion here in the Dale. But, you know, you just gotta  stand up and salute their death rate. I ran a statistical analysis,  (smiles) and hello darkness. It makes... D.C. look... like Mayberry, and  ain't nobody saying boo about it. We could fit right in here. Have us  some fun."
Kakistos,(growls) We're here for one thing.
Trick,"Kill the Slayer, yeah. Still, big picture..."
Boy,"(smiles) Have a nice night, sir."
Trick,(smiles) Right back at ya. (sits back)
Kakistos,"The Slayer. I'm going to rip her spine from her body, and I'm  going to eat her heart and suck the marrow from her bones."
Trick,Now I'm hungry.
Lyrics,<I>Everything is quiet</I>
Buffy,I miss you.
Lyrics,<I>Since you're not around</I>
Lyrics,<I>And I live in the numbness now</I>
Lyrics,<I>In the background</I>
Lyrics,<I>I do the things we did before</I>
Lyrics,<I>I walk Haight Street to the store</I>
Buffy,I had to.
Angel,I loved you.
Buffy,"Oh, God! Angel..."
Angel,(yells) GO TO HELL!
Angel,I did.
Joyce,"Morning, Sunshine! (smiles) Ready to face the beast?"
Snyder,"Here are the terms of your re-entry, Missy. Take 'em or leave  'em."
Snyder,One: that you pass a makeup test of every class you skipped out  on last year.
Snyder,"Two: that you provide, in writing, one *glowing* letter of  recommendation from any member of our faculty who is not an English  librarian."
Snyder,Three: that you complete an interview (stands up) with our  school psychologist (walks around his desk toward Buffy) who must  conclude that your violent tendencies...
Snyder,...are under control.
Joyce,"I'm not sure I like your attitude, Mr. Snyder. I spoke with the  school board, and according to them..."
Snyder,(walks back around his desk) I'm required to educate every  juvenile who is not in jail where she belongs.
Snyder,Welcome back.
Buffy,"So let me get this straight. I'm really back in school because  the school board *overruled* you. (Snyder faces her) Wow. That's like  having your whole ability to do this job called into question, when you  think about it."
Joyce,"(gets up also) I think what my daughter's trying to say is...  (sing-song) Nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah, nyah."
Secretary,It's the Mayor on line one.
Willow,It's so great that you're a schoolgirl again.
Buffy,Giles say what he wanted? Do you think he's mad?
Willow,"No, I don't think so. I think he just needed to see you.  (glances around) (smiling) Have you ever noticed, though, when he *is*  mad, but he's too English to say anything, he makes that weird cluck- cluck sound with his tongue?"
Buffy,"Hi, Giles! (raises her eyebrows at Willow and smiles)"
Willow,"(turns to face him, looking worried) Oh, hi! Been there long?"
Giles,"(preoccupied) Buffy, good timing. (looks around behind the  counter) I could use your help. I trust you remember the demon Acathla?"
Buffy,"Giles, contain yourself. Yes, I'm back in school, but you know  how it embarrasses me when you gush so. (Giles looks up from his  searching) Let's just skip all that and get straight to work."
Giles,"(slowly straightens up) Oh, ahhhh... Well, I, um... Well-w... O- o-of course, it's wonderful to have you back, i-i-it goes without  saying. (Buffy raises her eyebrows at him and smiles) But... (notices  Buffy's look) You enjoy making me say it, don't you?"
Buffy,"Okay, Acathla, huh? What are you doing, making him some demon  pizza?"
Giles,We need to make sure that he remains dormant and that the  dimensional vortex is sealed tight. So I'm working on a binding spell.
Willow,"(perks up) Oh, a spell? Can I help?"
Giles,"Possibly, with the research. It's very sensitive and..."
Willow,(sounding hurt) Oh! Who's more sensitive than me?
Giles,"...and difficult spell. (Willow frowns) It involves creating a- a-a protective circle around... Well, I don't want to bore you with the  details, but, uh, well, there's a litany th-that one has to recite in  Aramaic, and it's very specific. So I need to get a few details about  your experience of defeating Acathla and Angel."
Buffy,(considers for a moment) Fire away.
Giles,"I've put the time at about, um, (checks his notes) 6:17, around,  about half an hour after Xander rescued me. (comes back to the counter)"
Buffy,Less. More like ten minutes.
Giles,"Oh, was the vortex already open?"
Buffy,Barely.
Giles,I see. And Angel?
Buffy,"A big fight, Angel got the pointy end of the sword, Acathla  sucked him into Hell instead of the world. That's about the it."
Giles,"(writes a few notes) Yes, well, that, um... should be very  helpful."
Buffy,"(checks her watch) Oh, no, I have to go take an English makeup  exam. (gets her pile of books from the counter) They give you credit  just for speaking it, right?"
Buffy,(whines) Oh...
Willow,"Mm, sage. I love that smell. (reaches into a jar) And marnox  root. You know, a smidge of this mixed with a virgin's saliva... (gets a  look from Giles) Does something I know nothing about."
Giles,"These forces are not something that one plays around with,  Willow. What have you been conjuring?"
Willow,"Nothing... much. Well, you know, I tried this spell to cure  Angel, and I guess that was a bust. But since then, you know, small  stuff: floating feather, fire out of ice, which next time I won't do on  the bedspread. (Giles looks down) Are you mad at me?"
Giles,"(looks up) No, of course not, no. If I were, I would be making a  strange clucking sound with my tongue."
Lyrics,<I>I've given you every part of me / Tried everything I could to  make you see</I>
Lyrics,<I>But you don't love yourself</I>
Buffy,Don't let me interrupt.
Oz,Thanks.
Lyrics,<I>You can't love me or anyone else</I>
Willow,Are you... (to Oz) Is she all glowy?
Oz,"Yeah, I suspect happiness."
Buffy,"(smiles) I passed my English makeup exam, hangin' with my  friends. Hello, my life, how I've missed you."
Lyrics,<I>You said I was the best thing in your life</I>
Willow,"Hi, Scott. What are you doing here?"
Scott,"(gives her a smile) You told me if I came after 8:00, I could  run into Buffy."
Lyrics,"<I>Is that why you run, why you hide?</I>"
Scott,"(to Buffy, smiling) Uh, I'm sorry. I'm a bad liar. It's not good  for the soul. (gestures at his face) O-o-or the skin, actually. It makes  me blotch."
Lyrics,<I>You will never be the cure</I>
Buffy,"Hi, Scott. (smiles)"
Scott,Hi.
Lyrics,<I>And you will never change</I>
Scott,Don't you love this song?
Buffy,"Uh, yeah! Actually, I do."
Lyrics,<I>You will never be the cure</I>
Scott,"Well, would you like to... (indicates the dance floor)"
Buffy,Dance? Um...
Lyrics,<I>And you will never change</I>
Buffy,I don't know. (Willow frowns) I'm bad with... Well...
Lyrics,<I>You will never be the cure</I>
Buffy,"(fidgets) Thank you for asking, it's just that there..."
Scott,"Okay, you know what? I'm just gonna go stand by the dance floor.  If you change your mind, you can mosey on over, and then if not, then  you don't mosey. No harm, no foul, right?"
Buffy,(halfheartedly) Right.
Lyrics,<I>I've given you every part of me</I>
Willow,"(very disappointed) Come on, Buffy. I mean, the guy is charm,  a-and normal, which is what you wanted to get back to."
Lyrics,<I>Tried everything I could to make you see</I>
Oz,Plus bonus points for use of the word 'mosey'.
Buffy,I just don't think I'm ready.
Willow,What's stopping you?
Lyrics,<I>But you don't love yourself</I>
Cordelia,Check out Slut-O-Rama and her Disco Dave.
Cordelia,"What was the last thing that guy danced to, K.C. and the  Sunshine Band?"
Lyrics,<I>You can't love me or anyone else</I>
Lyrics,<I>You said I was the best thing in your life</I>
Buffy,I don't think that guy thrives on sunshine.
Scott,Hi.
Buffy,"(stops short, startled) Hi. Oh, (frowns) no, I... (points at the  door) I-I have to..."
Scott,"(gets it) Oh. Uh, uh, sorry, my bad."
Buffy,"(apologetic) No. I-it's mine. Really, it's mine, but I...  (glances back at the others) I-I-I have to go. (hurries out)"
Buffy,Where'd she go?
Cordelia,I bet it's nothing. They're probably just making out.
Girl,Hey!
Willow,"That's not what making out sounds like, unless I'm doing it  wrong."
Boy,Stop struggling. This won't hurt.
Girl,"It's okay, I got it. You're, uh, Buffy, right?"
Faith,I'm Faith.
Oz,(to Willow) I'm gonna go out on a limb and say there's a new Slayer  in town.
Faith,Can I borrow that?
Faith,"Thanks, B. Couldn't have done it without you."
Faith,"The whole summer it was, like, the worst heat wave. So it's  about a hundred and eighteen degrees and I'm sleeping without a stitch  on."
Faith,"And all of a sudden, I hear this screaming from outside. So I go  tearing out, stark nude, (Xander looks down at her body, licking his  lips) and this church bus has broke down, and there's these three vamps  feasting (Buffy listens calmly) on half the Baptists in South Boston.  (Willow listens intently) So I waste the vamps, and the preacher comes  up, and he's hugging me like there's no tomorrow, when all of a sudden,  the cops pull up and they arrested us both."
Xander,Wow. They should film that story and show it every Christmas.
Faith,"God, I could eat a horse. Isn't it crazy how slayin' just always  makes you hungry and horny? (gobbles a piece)"
Buffy,Well... Sometimes I-I crave a nonfat yogurt afterwards.
Cordelia,I get it.
Cordelia,"Not the horny thing. Yuck! But the two Slayer thing. There  was one, and then Buffy died for, like, two minutes, so then Kendra was  called, and then when she died, Faith was called."
Willow,But why were you called here?
Faith,"Well, I wasn't. My Watcher went off to some retreat thing in  England, and so I skipped out. I figured this was my chance to meet the  infamous Buff and compare notes. (Buffy gives her a little smile) So, B,  did you really use a rocket launcher one time?"
Buffy,"Uh, yeah, (leans forward) actually, it's a funny story. There  was..."
Xander,"(interrupts) So what was the, uh, story about that alligator?  You, uh, said something... before."
Faith,"(with lots of gesturing) Oh, there's this Big Daddy Vampire out  of Missouri who used to keep them as pets. So he's got me rasslin' one  of 'em, okay? The thing must have been twelve feet (3.7 m) long and  I'm..."
Xander,"(interrupts) So was this, um, ahem, also naked?"
Faith,"(teases) Well, the alligator was. (laughs)"
Cordelia,Xander? (glares when he looks) Find a new theme.
Faith,"(shakes her head) I tell ya, I never had more trouble than that  damn vamp. (to Buffy) So what about you? What was your toughest kill?"
Buffy,"Um, well, you know, (smiles weakly) they're all difficult, I  guess."
Buffy,"Uh... (remembers) Oh! Oh, do you guys remember the Three?"
Buffy,"That's right, you never met the Three. Well, there was three..."
Oz,"(interrupts) Something occurring. Uh, now, you both kill vamps, and  who could blame you, but, I'm, I'm wondering about your position on  werewolves."
Willow,(put her hand on his shoulder) Oz is a werewolf.
Buffy,It's a long story. (grins)
Oz,(shrugs) I got bit.
Buffy,Apparently not that long.
Faith,"(considers briefly) Hey, as long as you don't go scratchin' at  me or humpin' my leg, we're five-by-five, you know?"
Oz,Fair enough.
Faith,"The vamps, though, they better get their asses to DEFCON ONE,  (points to Buffy) 'cause you and I are gonna have fun, you know,  Watcherless and fancy-free. (smiles)"
Buffy,Watcherless?
Faith,"(looks around at everyone) Didn't yours go to England, too?"
Giles,There's a Watchers' retreat every year in the Cotswolds. (walks  to the other end of the table) It's a lovely spot. It's very s-serene.  (everyone listens) There's horse riding and hiking and punting (smiles)  and lectures and discussions. It-i-it's... it's a great honor to be  invited. (a tad bitter) Or so I'm told.
Faith,"Oh, it's boring. Way too stuffy for a guy like you."
Buffy,"Um, maybe I should introduce you again. Faith, this is *Giles*."
Faith,"I see him. If I'd've known they came *that* young and cute, I  would've requested a transfer."
Buffy,(grossed out) Raise your hand if 'ew'. (raises her hand)
Giles,"(chuckles) Well, um, uh, leaving aside for a moment my, uh,  youth and beauty, (goes to the copier) I'd-I'd say it was, um, (grabs  the newspaper) fortuitous that Faith arrived when she did. (comes back  with it)"
Willow,(shoots up her finger) (loudly) Aha!
Willow,"Sorry. I just meant... (shoots up her finger again) (loudly)  aha! There's big evil brewin'. You'll never be bored here, Faith. (Faith  grins at her) 'Cause this is Sunnydale, home of the big brewin' evil."
Giles,"Yes, well, I don't know how big an evil it is, but, uh, two  people have disappeared from the Sunset Ridge District."
Buffy,"Well, I'm good for patrolling. Late-ish, though. I promised Mom  I'd be home for dinner."
Buffy,"Um, to which you're also invited, of course, dinner with us."
Faith,Dyin' to meet the fam. I'm in.
Buffy,"Great! Great, then we can patrol, (less than thrilled) also  together."
Willow,"Hey, don't you have that health science makeup?"
Buffy,"Oh, yeah. Actually, I could use a little coaching."
Willow,"(to Faith) You know, you can hang out with us while she's  testing. You wanna?"
Xander,"Say yes and, uh, bring your stories. (smiles as he walks out  past Faith)"
Buffy,(goes to the table) You guys go. It's fine. Fine! I'll just...  (sits) sit.
Faith,"(to Buffy) Okay. Hey, later. (to Giles) *We* will talk weapons."
Giles,"(points) This, um, this new girl seems to (sits on the table)  have a lot of zest. (smiles)"
Giles,"I-I-I've been having a little problem with the, uh, binding  spell for Acathla. I-I-I'm lacking the, the requisite details to perform  it correctly. Now, physical location. Acathla was facing south?"
Buffy,"Mm-hm. (points to three positions on the table) Acathla, Angel,  me. (makes a jabbing gesture through the three positions) Sword. (looks  up at him)"
Giles,"Now, see, that's what I thought, but I..."
Buffy,"(interrupts and stands up) Giles, look, I've got makeup tests to  pass, (pulls on her backpack) missing people in Sunset Ridge, and a  zesty new Slayer to feed. (grabs her books) Next time I kill Angel, I'll  video it."
Willow,"And over here, we have the cafeteria, (points at the door)  where we were mauled by snakes."
Xander,(points down) And this is the spot where Angel tried to kill  Willow.
Willow,"Oh, (points, smiling) and over there in the lounge is where  Spike and his gang nearly massacred us all on Parent-Teacher night."
Willow,"Oh, a-and up those stairs, I was sucked into a muddy grave."
Xander,"And they say young people don't learn anything in high school  nowadays, but, um, I've learned to be afraid. (smiles)"
Faith,"(grins and laughs) You guys are a hoot and a half. If I'd had  friends like you in high school, I... probably still would've dropped  out. But I might've been sad about it, you know?"
Faith,"(crosses her arms) Hey, so what's up with B? I mean, she seems  wound kinda tight. Needs to find the fun a little? Like you two."
Willow,"Well, um, she..."
Faith,(spies the drinking fountain and points) Oh. Water.
Xander,"Oh, and then the alligator story! (to Willow) She's got  something, doesn't she?"
Cordelia,What is it with you and Slayers? (Xander jerks around to face  her) Maybe I should dress up as one and put a stake to your throat.
Xander,"Please, God, don't let that be sarcasm. (takes her arm and  smiles)"
Scott,Oh. Excuse me.
Faith,Sorry. (looks at him curiously) I know you from somewhere.
Scott,"(recognizes her also) The Bronze. You're friends with Buffy,  right?"
Faith,Yeah. I'm Faith. (holds out her hand)
Scott,(accepts it) I'm Scott. Nice to meet you.
Faith,Nice to meet you!
Buffy,"Well, I'm two for two with makeup tests. Proud, yes, but also  humble in this time of... (notices them all staring) We're looking at  what?"
Cordelia,Does anyone believe that is her actual hair color?
Willow,"I haven't seen him laugh like that. Hey, maybe Faith and Scott  could hit it off. (Buffy looks at her) I mean, if you're done with him.  (realizes she's doing it again) Not that you used him."
Buffy,"Well, I... hadn't definitely one hundred percent said no for all  time. It's just, you know... You don't enter into these things lightly,  you know. There's, there's repercussions to consider and..."
Buffy,Why am I seeing a look?
Willow,"(looks at her) You really *do* need to find the fun, B."
Willow,Uffy.
Buffy,(smiles) Hey!
Scott,"Hey, Buffy! Uh, Faith has been telling me tall tales."
Buffy,(smiles big) She's funny. (takes her arm) And she's leaving. We  have to go.
Scott,(disappointed) Oh...
Faith,Bye.
Faith,(gestures back) He's a cutie. Is he seeing anybody?
Kakistos,"Mr. Trick, talk to me."
Trick,"(looks up) Check this out. (walks over) This town, this very  street, wired for fiber optics. (grins widely) See, we jack in a T-3,  um, twenty-five hundred megs per, we have the whole *world* at our  fingertips."
Trick,"What I'm saying is, (grins) we stay local--where the humans are  jumpin' and the cotton is high--but we live global. I mean, you know,  you get the hankering for the blood of a fifteen-year-old Filipina, and  I'm on the 'Net and she's here the next day, express air. (smiles  widely)"
Kakistos,(losing his patience) I want the blood of the Slayer.
Trick,"On that note, there's good news and bad. Rumor has it that this  town already has a Slayer, which makes two. (shakes his head) I'm not  real sure how that happened."
Kakistos,"(jumps up from his chair, shouting) I don't care if there're  a *hundred* Slayers! I'll kill them all! (indicates his scarred, blinded  eye) She's going to pay for what she did to me."
Trick,"(nods) Yeah, she is. (there's a knocking at the door) I'm  running a computer check on every hotel, rooming house and youth hostel  in town. (goes to get a welder's glove) Meanwhile, as soon as the sun  goes down, (pulls on the glove) we're out in force. (heads for the door)  Food's here, boys."
Joyce,"So you're a Slayer, too. Isn't that interesting! (smiles) Do you  like it? (sets down the bowl)"
Faith,"God, I love it!"
Buffy,"(wants the bowl) Uh, Mom?"
Joyce,"(waves her off) Uh, just a second, honey. (scoops broccoli onto  Faith's plate) You know, Buffy never talks that way. Why do you love it?"
Faith,"Well, when I'm fighting, it's like the whole world goes away and  I only know one thing: that I'm gonna win and they're gonna lose. I like  that feelin'. (digs into her food)"
Buffy,"Well, sure. Beats that dead feeling you get when they win and  you lose."
Faith,I don't let that kind of negative thinking in.
Joyce,"(points at Faith) Right. (shakes her finger) Right. That could  get you hurt. Buffy can be awfully negative sometimes. (to Buffy) See,  honey, you gotta fight that. (smiles)"
Buffy,(smiles back weakly) I'm working on it. (keeps taking fries)
Joyce,"(notices Faith's empty glass) Oh, Faith, can I get you another  soft drink?"
Faith,"(hands over the glass) Oh, you bet."
Joyce,Right. (goes into the kitchen)
Faith,"She's really cool, huh?"
Buffy,Best mom ever. (looks back into the kitchen) Excuse me.
Joyce,"I like this girl, Buffy. (pours the soda)"
Buffy,"She's very personable. (sits on a stool) She gets along with my  friends, my Watcher, my mom. (leans back and looks into the dining room)  Look, now she's getting along with my fries. (leans forward)"
Joyce,"(closes the soda bottle) Now, Buffy..."
Buffy,"Plus, at school today, she was making eyes at my not-boyfriend.  This is creepy."
Joyce,(crosses her arms) Does anybody else think Faith is creepy?
Buffy,"(pouts) No, but I'm the one getting single-white-femaled here."
Joyce,(nods) It's probably good you were an only child.
Buffy,"Mom, I'm just getting my life back. I'm not looking to go  halfsies on it."
Joyce,"Well, there are some things I'd be happy to see you share. Like  the slaying. I mean, two of you fighting is safer than one, right?"
Buffy,I guess.
Joyce,"Unless, I mean, you heard her. She *loves* the slaying. (leans  over the island) Couldn't she take over for you?"
Buffy,"Mom, no one can take over for me."
Joyce,But you're going to college next year. I think it would be...
Buffy,"Mom, the only way you get a new Slayer is when the old Slayer  dies."
Joyce,Then that means you... (upset) When did you die? You never told  me you died!
Buffy,"No, i-it was just for a few minutes."
Joyce,"(starts to pace nervously) Oh, I hate this. I hate your life."
Buffy,"Mom, I..."
Joyce,"(faces her daughter) Look, I-I know you didn't choose this, I  know it chose you. (takes a breath) I have tried to march in the 'Slayer  Pride' parade, but... (suddenly very solemn) I don't want you to die."
Joyce,Oh...
Buffy,"I'm not gonna die. I know how to do my job. (releases the hug)  Besides, like you said, I've got help now."
Buffy,(raises her eyebrows) I've got all the help I can stand.
Faith,"Didn't we, um, do this street already?"
Buffy,Funny thing about vamps. They'll hit a street even *after*  you've been there. It's like they have no manners.
Faith,(shrugs) Mm. You've been doing this the longest.
Buffy,I have.
Faith,Yeah. Maybe a little *too* long.
Buffy,(looks at Faith) Excuse me? What's that supposed to mean?
Faith,Nothing.
Buffy,You got a problem?
Faith,"(spreads her arms) I'm five-by-five, B, living entirely large,  actually wondering about (points at her) *your* problem."
Buffy,"Well, I may not sleep in the nude and rassle alligators..."
Faith,"Maybe it's time you started, 'cause obviously *something* in  your bottle needs uncorking. What is it, (gestures wildly) the, the  Angel thing? (keeps looking around)"
Buffy,(stops in her tracks) What do you know about Angel?
Faith,"(faces her, copping an attitude) Just what your friends tell me:  big love, big loss. You oughta deal and move on, but you're not."
Buffy,"(steps closer) I got an idea: how about from now on, we don't  hear from you on Angel or anything else in my life. Which, by the way,  is *my* life."
Faith,"What are you getting so strung out for, B?"
Buffy,"Why are your lips still moving, F?"
Faith,Did I just hear a threat?
Buffy,Would you like to?
Faith,Wow. Think you can take me?
Buffy,Yeah. (looks over Faith's shoulder) I just hope they can't.
Faith,My dead mother hits harder than that!
Buffy,Faith! Stake him already and give me a hand!
Faith,"This is *me*, (punch) you un (punch) dead (punch) bastard!"
Vampire,For Kakistos we live! For Kakistos you'll die!
Buffy,(screams) FAITH!
Buffy,OH!
Buffy,Faith!
Faith,You (punch) can't (punch) touch (punch) me!
Buffy,What is wrong with you?
Faith,What are you talking about?
Buffy,I'm talking about you 'living large' on that vampire!
Faith,"Gee, if doing violence to vampires upsets you, I think you're in  the wrong line of work!"
Buffy,"Yeah, or maybe you like it a little too much."
Faith,I was getting the job done.
Buffy,The job is to slay demons! *Not* beat them to a bloody pulp  while their friends corner me!
Faith,(shrugs) I thought you could handle yourself. (walks off)
Giles,"What you must realize, Buffy, is that you and Faith have very  different temperaments. (sips his coffee)"
Buffy,"Yeah, and mine's the sane one. (Giles chuckles) The girl's not  playing with a full deck, Giles. She has almost no deck. She has a  three."
Giles,"You said yourself that she-she killed one. Sh-she-she's just a  plucky fighter who got a little carried away. Which is natural. She's  focused on the slaying. She doesn't have a whole other life here, as you  do."
Buffy,She doesn't need a life. She has mine.
Giles,I think you're being a little...
Buffy,"No, I'm being a lot. (Giles sips again) I know that. But she  nearly got us both killed. The girl needs help."
Giles,All right. I'll see if I can reach her Watcher at the retreat.  They're (checks his watch) eight hours ahead now. I guess they're  probably sitting down to a nightcap.
Giles,"I wonder if they still kayak. I used to love a good kayak.  (Buffy comes back) You see, t-they don't even consider... (sees her  looking at him) Sorry. I digress. (they both continue) The, um, vampires  that attacked you, can you furnish me with some details that might help  me trace their lineage? I mean, ancient or-or-or modern dress. Amulets,  cultish tattoos... (sips his coffee)"
Buffy,"Uh, no tats. Crappy dressers. And, uh... Oh, the one that nearly  bit me mentioned something about kissing toast. (a spark of recognition  appears on Giles' face) He lived for kissing toast."
Giles,You mean 'Kakistos'?
Buffy,(tries to remember) Maybe it was taquitos. Maybe he lived for  taquitos. (looks at him) What?
Giles,Kakistos. (heads into the library)
Buffy,(frowns) Is that bad? (follows him)
Giles,'Kakistos' is Greek. It means the worst of the worst. (Heads  behind the counter) It's also the name of a vampire so old that his  hands and feet are cloven.
Buffy,"Now, this guy shows up two days ago, right? Right around the  same time my bestest new little sister makes the scene."
Giles,(looks up and considers) You think he and Faith are connected?
Buffy,"Giles, there are two things that I don't believe in: coincidence  and leprechauns."
Giles,"Well, Buffy, it's entirely possible that they both arrived here  by chance simultaneously."
Buffy,"Okay, but I was right about the leprechauns, right?"
Giles,"(thinks for a moment) As far as I know, yes."
Buffy,"Good. Okay, you get England on the phone. I'm gonna talk to  Faith, see if 'khaki trousers' rings..."
Giles,Kakistos.
Buffy,Kakistos rings a bell. Or an alarm.
Giles,Right.
Buffy,Right. (heads out)
Scott,Hi.
Buffy,(surprised to see him) Scott!
Scott,How are you?
Buffy,"Uh, o-okay. You know, I-I gotta..."
Scott,"I know, be somewhere else, right? Think of this as my last-ditch  effort. I realize that one more is gonna qualify as stalking.  (nervously) I've given it a lot of thought--some might say too much  thought--to, to how I might be a part of your life. It begins with  conversation. We all know this. Maybe over a cup of coffee, or maybe at  the Buster Keaton festival playing on State Street all this weekend."
Buffy,"You know, come to think of it, I-I don't think I've given a fair  chance to... Buster Keaton. I... I like what I've seen of him so far.  I... I think it might be time to see a little more."
Scott,"(takes and releases a breath, smiling) Keaton is key. Oh.  (reaches into a pocket) Um, I got you a little present. (pulls out a  small box) The guy in the retro shop said that it represents friendship,  (holds it out to her) and that's something I would very much like to  have with you."
Scott,You like?
Buffy,I can't. I-I-I-I can't do this. (takes a quick breath)
Scott,Okay. I get the message. (leaves)
Giles,Are you all right?
Buffy,"Uh... (looks up) Giles, I, uh... (wipes a tear) Yeah, I'm fine.  (tries to settle herself) Um, did you reach the retreat?"
Giles,"(looks at the floor) Yes, I did."
Buffy,W-what did her Watcher say?
Giles,Her Watcher's dead.
Manager,The room's eighteen dollars a day. That's every day.
Faith,"Yeah, I know. I'll get it to you by tomorrow, I swear."
Manager,(sighs and shrugs) It's not like I own the place.
Faith,(gives him a smile) But I bet you will someday.
Manager,Not if I listen to broads like you.
Manager,"(to Faith, indicating Buffy) Roommates are extra."
Buffy,I'm just visiting.
Faith,"So, what brings you to the poor side of town?"
Buffy,Cloven Guy. Goes by the name Kakistos.
Faith,(taken aback) What do you know about Kakistos?
Buffy,That he's here.
Buffy,"We're not happy to see old friends, are we? What'd he do to you?"
Faith,"(quickly grabs her bag) It's what I did to him, all right?"
Buffy,"And what was that? Faith, you came here for a reason. I can  help."
Faith,(looks up from packing) You can mind your own business. (points  at herself) *I'm* the one that can handle this.
Buffy,"Yeah. You're a real bad-ass when it comes to packing. (gets a  look from Faith) What was that you said about my problem? Gotta deal and  move on? Well, we have the 'moving on' part right here. What about  dealing? Is that just something you're gonna dump on me?"
Faith,"(finishes packing) You don't know me. You don't know what I've  been through. I'll take care of this, all right? (heads for the door)"
Buffy,Like you took care of your Watcher?
Buffy,"He killed her, didn't he?"
Faith,(angrily) They don't have a word for what he did to her.
Faith,"(sighs) Oh, what now?"
Buffy,"Faith, you run, he runs after you."
Faith,That's where the head start comes in handy.
Kakistos,Faith.
Faith,No!
Buffy,I just bought us a little more...
Buffy,...time!
Faith,(panics and screams) NO! NOOOOO!
Buffy,Scream later! Escape now!
Buffy,Let's go!
Buffy,We're okay. (faces Faith) What happened?
Buffy,"Faith, what happened?"
Faith,"(frightened) I... I was *there* when he killed my Watcher, and I  saw what he did to her... what he was gonna do to me. I tried to stop  him, but I... I couldn't. And I ran."
Buffy,"(breathing hard) Faith, first rule of slaying: don't die. You  did the right thing. Okay? You didn't die. Now you do the math. One of  him, two of us."
Faith,(looks past Buffy shaking her head) No.
Buffy,Yes.
Faith,(getting panicky) No.
Faith,This is his place.
Buffy,He drove us here.
Buffy,Faith! (gets her attention) Don't die! (throws her the crowbar)
Faith,NO!
Trick,"If we don't do something, the Master could get killed."
Trick,"Well, our prayers are with him."
Trick,There's a reason these vengeance crusades are out of style. It's  the modern vampire who sees the big picture.
Kakistos,"I guess you need a bigger stake, Slayer! (laughs maniacally)"
Buffy,You hungry?
Faith,Starved.
Giles,The council has approved our request. Faith is to stay here  indefinitely. (walks around the table) I'm to look after you both until  a new Watcher is assigned. (picks up some papers)
Buffy,"Good. She really came through in the end. (slides off of the  table) She had a lot to deal with, but she did it. She got it behind  her."
Giles,I'm glad to hear it. (looks over the papers)
Buffy,Angel was cured.
Giles,(looks up) I'm sorry?
Buffy,"When I killed him, Angel was cured. (to Willow) Your spell  worked at the last minute, Will. (Willow looks up, taking it all in) I  was about to take him out, and, um... something went through him... and  he was Angel again. He-he didn't remember anything that he'd done. He  just held me. Um, but i-it was... it was too late, and I, I had to. So  I, I told him that I loved him... and I kissed him... and I killed him."
Buffy,"I don't know if that helps with your spell or not, Giles."
Giles,"Uh, yes, I, I believe it will."
Willow,(very sympathetically) I'm sorry.
Buffy,"It's okay. (gives them a little smile) I've been holding on to  that for so long. Felt good to get it out. (pauses, then smiles thinly)  I'll see you guys later."
Willow,"Giles, I know you don't like me playing with mystical forces,  but I can really help with this binding spell."
Giles,There is no spell.
Buffy,Scott.
Scott,"(stops) Uh, hello. (pulls on his backpack)"
Buffy,"Hey. Uh, I was, um, I was waiting for you to get out of class."
Scott,"Oh. Um, why?"
Buffy,"Um... There was someone a while ago, and, uh, the ring sort of  confused me. But I liked what you said about friendship. (begins to  ramble) I liked it a lot. And Buster Keaton. Big fun. And I'm capable of  big fun even though there's no earthly way you could possibly know that  about me. Wow. If I knew I was gonna go on this long, I probably  would've brought some water. Uh, (exhales) what I'm trying to say is,  um... if you would still like to go to the film festival--and I would  understand it if you didn't--I'd pretty much love to go with you."
Scott,"(looks around awkwardly) Uh... Ahem. (shrugs) I don't know,  Buffy. I'm, I'm really gonna have to think about this."
Scott,"Okay. You know what, I thought about it, and I'm in. When do you  want to go?"
Buffy,"(smiles) Uh, well, I have one thing that I have to do tonight,  and then I'm good."
Scott,(smiles) Good.
Buffy,(quietly) Goodbye.
