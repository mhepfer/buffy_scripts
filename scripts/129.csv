character,dialogue
WILLOW,Tara?
BUFFY,"Willow, what did you do?"
ANYA,We have to get you out of here or you'll both be killed.
ANDREW,What about Warren?
ANYA,She killed him.
ANDREW,"(to Jonathan) We gotta get out of this town. Mexico. We   should go to Mexico?"
ANYA,How did you do it?
BUFFY,What is she talking about?
SPIKE,Nothing. Let's go.
ANYA,I can see you.
BUFFY,You got your soul back.
BUFFY,Cassie? Cassie. Cassie.
SPIKE,"This&#151;just the beginning, luv. Horror and bloodshed.   (points to the ground) From beneath you, it devours."
SINGER,Night falls...
BUFFY,Here we go.
ANDREW,"(sighs) You keep circling around. Justjust drive straight   in."
JONATHAN,Will you shut up? We gotta keep it low pro.
ANDREW,You're just scared.
JONATHAN,"Of course I'm scared. Last time we were here, 33.3bar   percent of us were flayed alive."
ANDREW,"Calm down. No one's getting flayed alive. We got a plan.   We're gonna fix all that."
JONATHAN,Wish I'd have stayed in Mexico.
ANDREW,"Ah, I didn't like it there. Everybody spoke Mexicalan."
JONATHAN,"You could've learned it. You learned the entire Klingon   dictionary in two and a half weeks."
ANDREW,"That had much clearer transitive and intransitive rules,   OK? Besides, I can't keep having those nightmares."
JONATHAN,Me neither. Desde abajo te debora.
ANDREW,"""It eats you starting with your bottom."""
JONATHAN,Gonna make it right.
ANDREW,(getting misty-eyed) We're outlaws with hearts of gold.
DAWN,"(singing) Anchovies, anchovies, you're so delicious. I love   you more than all the other fishes."
DAWN,"Oh. Ah, she'll think it's blood."
DAWN,"Taste my blade, spawn of evil!"
DAWN,(laughs) Cool.
CASSIE,"So, (Willow turns to look) this is the UC library, huh?   It's so big. Hey."
WILLOW,"I know you. I mean, I saw your picture."
CASSIE,"(walks out from behind the stacks to Willow's table) Yeah,   I know, it's kinda weird 'cause we never really met."
WILLOW,Or kinda weird because your're really dead.
CASSIE,Yeah well... (laughs)
WILLOW,Did I fall asleep?
CASSIE,"No, no, I'm here. I mean, not-not here here... it's kinda   complicated. Kind of ironic, too, you know. I wrote all that intense poetry about the   end, and here I am again. Chatting you up."
WILLOW,"Yeah, ironic."
CASSIE,"I knew this would completely freak you out. It's just   (sits at Willow's table) she asked that I come talk to you. It's important."
WILLOW,She?
CASSIE,Don't worry. I'm not gona hurt you or anything
WILLOW,Who asked you? What are you talking about?
CASSIE,She says she still sings.
WILLOW,What?
CASSIE,"Remember that time on the bridge when you sang to each   other? Well, she says even though you can't hear it, she still sings to   you."
WILLOW,Tara?
DAWN,"(to phone) Oh, come on. She is so dead. Well, he's clearly a   psychopath. Is so. What? No, that is not Tom Hanks. Well, what channel are you   on? (knock) OK, there it is again. I keep hearing this, like, thumping. (mutes   television) (knock, knock) No, I-I can't tell if it's"
DAWN,"(to phone) Kit, are you there? Is there a storm?"
VAMPIRE,Buffy? (laughs) Buffy Summers?
BUFFY,Have we
BUFFY,Sure! Sure.
DAWN,"Oh, God. Oh, God..."
DAWN,Mom?
HOLDEN,"OK, um, junior year, spring production of Pippin, uh, I   did the lighting design."
BUFFY,I didn't see it.
HOLDEN,"But you'd helped me move the lighting board, and I dropped   it on your foot."
BUFFY,"Right, foot. Yes, of course. History class. It's all coming   back. Sorry."
HOLDEN,"Well, you know, it's not like I was a big part of your   life or anything."
BUFFY,"No, I justI didn't recognize you, you know, your face, all   demon, and I think you've filled out a lot."
HOLDEN,"Oh, yeah, well I got into to Tae Kwon Do in a big way at   Dartmouth, so..."
BUFFY,That's great.
HOLDEN,Yeah.
BUFFY,So what have you been up to?
HOLDEN,"Well, apparently dying. (they laugh) Uh, no, but other   stuff. (they start walking) Uhh, you know, majoring in Psych. Really liking   that. Uhh, took a year of to do an internship at the Sunnydale Mental   Hospital."
BUFFY,"Wow. That's gotta be a... popular   joint."
HOLDEN,"II keep telling them we ought to get a velvet rope and a   bouncer. (they stop walking) Hey, you remember Jason Wheeler, you know, ""Crazy   J""?"
BUFFY,"(leans on nearby headstone) Oh, yeah."
HOLDEN,"He always had that shtick of (waves hands around) ""Yeah,   I'm crazy, I'm crazy."""
BUFFY,How is he?
HOLDEN,"Crazy. He's been in the chronic ward since graduation.   (laughs, then stops) Not really that funny, I guess."
BUFFY,"Ironic, sorta."
HOLDEN,"Yeah. (face changes from vampire to normal) Whoa. Did my   face just change?"
BUFFY,"Yeah. You look human now. You can do thatgo back and   forth."
HOLDEN,"Oh, so I'm a vampire. (laughs) How weird is that?"
BUFFY,Sorry.
HOLDEN,"No, no. Feels great. Strong. Like I'm connected to a   powerful all-consuming evil that's gonna suck the world into a firey oblivion.   How 'bout you?"
BUFFY,"Not so much connected. (stands and walks away, he   follows)"
HOLDEN,"No, no. I mean, with the stake and the crossyou do this   kind of thing a lot?"
BUFFY,"(stops walking, turns to face him) I'm the slayer. It's   sort of a thing."
HOLDEN,"So, whatyou like fight vampires professionally? Or"
BUFFY,"Oh, I don't get paid. It's more like a calling. Sinceeven   in school."
HOLDEN,"I heard a lot of rumors about you back then. You were all   mysterious."
BUFFY,I was?
HOLDEN,"Well, you were never around. A lot of kids thought you   were dating some really old guy, or that you were just heavy religious. Scott   Hope said you were gay."
BUFFY,What? I dated that ringworm.
HOLDEN,"He says that about every girl he breaks up with. And then   last year, big surprise, he comes out."
BUFFY,(shakes her head) Men. Do I know how to pick 'em.
HOLDEN,"So, all that time, you were a slayer?"
BUFFY,The.
HOLDEN,"""The"", like as in ""the only one""?"
BUFFY,Pretty much.
HOLDEN,"Oh. So, when you said not connected, that was kind of a   telling statement, wasn't it?"
BUFFY,"(puts hands on hips) Ah, Psych 101 alert."
HOLDEN,"Well, I'm just saying."
BUFFY,"Yeah, what I really need is emotional therapy from the evil   dead."
HOLDEN,"Hey, it was your phrase."
BUFFY,"I'm connected. I'm connected to a lot of people, OK."
HOLDEN,"No. No, I hear ya."
BUFFY,I really am.
DAWN,"Buffy, come on, pick up. I don't know what to do!"
DAWN,(crying) Do it again! I heard you.
DAWN,Why are you doing this!
DAWN,"Why are you I don't understand. (knocking continues) Stop.   Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Aah!"
DAWN,Hello?
DAWN,"(to herself) Once for yes... (out loud) Once for yes, twice   for no. Mom? (looks around)"
DAWN,"Mom, it's you?"
DAWN,Are you OK?
DAWN,You're not. Mom... mommy... are you alone?
DAWN,Why are you doing this?!
JONATHAN,"Get up, you wuss."
ANDREW,I have shin splints. (tries to get up) Ow.
JONATHAN,Maybe we should turn on a light.
ANDREW,"No, they'll see it from outside."
JONATHAN,Right.
JONATHAN,Maybe we should go get Buffy.
ANDREW,No way.
JONATHAN,"We should just tell her what we know about this evil   Danthazar."
ANDREW,"(they start walking) Think, McFly. Why would she believe   us without any proof? We go to her empty-handed, and we'll be coolin' our   heels in the clink in a Bell's microsecond."
JONATHAN,"I ain't goin' back to the big house. That place changes   a man."
ANDREW,"That's why we need proof. Think of it asas trial by fire.   A quest."
JONATHAN,Una questa.
ANDREW,"We find it. We alert the slayer. We help her destroy it.   We save Sunnydale. (they stop walking) Then we join her gang and possibly hang   out at her house."
JONATHAN,Right. OK. What do we do?
ANDREW,"I think we should find the Principal's office and work our   way down from there."
JONATHAN,"OK, uh, um, uh, you go check down the hallway (points   left), and I'll go over there. (points right)"
ANDREW,Check communications?
JONATHAN,(to radio) Check. Check.
ANDREW,(to radio) Check. Check.
JONATHAN,Check.
ANDREW,Check. Check.
JONATHAN,Check. Check.
ANDREW,Check. Check. Check.
JONATHAN,Check.
JONATHAN,Echo 2 to Echo 1.
ANDREW,This is Echo 1. Go ahead.
JONATHAN,Do you think they'll really let us join their gang?
WARREN,Nice job.
ANDREW,There you are. I'm scared out of my frickin' gourd here.
WARREN,(laughs) Take it easy. Take it easy.
ANDREW,"Do you have any idea how hard it's been to act this   cool?"
WARREN,"Calm down, you're doing great. All specs are within   parameters."
ANDREW,"You keep leaving me. I hate it when you leave me. One time   you died, and I ended up a Mexican."
WARREN,"We've been over this. Now, that death thing was all part   of the master plan. Come on, ""If you strike me down..."""
ANDREW,"(doing an impression) ""I shall become more powerful than   you could possibly imagine."" (laughs) Of course. Do you think, maybe, Willow   could kill me, too?"
WARREN,"Hey, don't worry. If short round pulls off his end of the   bargain, we'll both become gods."
ANDREW,"(turns to look down hall where Jonathan went) (doing an   impression) ""That boy is our last hope."""
WARREN,"(walks forward to stand beside Andrew) ""No, there is   another."""
ANDREW,"(looks at Warren) Wait, really? Who's our last hope?"
WARREN,"No, I was just going with it. It was a thing. He's our   last hope."
WILLOW,"Tara, is it you?"
CASSIE,She's sorry she couldn't come herself.
WILLOW,"Why didn't she? I don't understand... I mean, if you can   manifest yourself"
CASSIE,She just can't.
WILLOW,Why not? I don't understand.
CASSIE,Because of what you did.
WILLOW,What?
CASSIE,"You killed people. You can't see her. That's just how it   is. I'm sorry."
WILLOW,"ButBut she's talking to you? And-and she can hear me?   (starts to cry, looks up) Tara? Tara, I miss you. I miss you so much. (to   Cassie) Can she hear me? What's happening. Did she say anything? What? Did she   go away?"
CASSIE,She's crying.
WILLOW,"No. No, don't cry. Don't cry, sweetie. Talk to me."
CASSIE,"She misses you, too. She wishes she could touch you."
WILLOW,"Me too. Oh, me, too. Oh, God, Tara, it hurts so much.   Everyday, it's like this giant hole, and it's not getting better."
CASSIE,It will. It can.
WILLOW,How? You're gone.
CASSIE,"But you're not. You're strong, like an Amazon,   remember?"
WILLOW,I do. I remember.
HOLDEN,"So, you meet someone, you form a bond..."
BUFFY,But it never lasts.
HOLDEN,"Do you mean in all relationships, or just yours?"
BUFFY,"My parents weren't exactly the paragon of   stay-togetherey-ness. Maybe that's part of it. I think there're people out   there who'd make it. I just... target the impossible ones... with deadly   accuracy."
HOLDEN,"You think you do that on purpose? Maybe you're trying to   protect yourself?"
BUFFY,"Protecting myself? From heartbreak, misery, sexual   violence, and possible death? Not so much."
HOLDEN,From committing.
BUFFY,(sits up) I commit. I'm committed. I'm a committee.
HOLDEN,"So it's them? You're reaching out, they're just not coming   through?"
BUFFY,"(shifts her body) It's different. I think you're confusing   me because you're evil."
HOLDEN,"I just think you're in some pain herewhich I do kind of   enjoy 'cause I'm evil nowbut you should just ease up on yourself. It's not   exactly like you have the patent on bad relationships."
BUFFY,Wouldn't it be cool if I did?
HOLDEN,"And what are yousupposed to be settling down already? At   21? You know, my girlfriend at college, she's so sweet. We have this great   thing, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna go vampify her just so we can be   together forever."
BUFFY,Sire.
HOLDEN,What?
BUFFY,"The wordwhen you turn a human into a vampireit's you   ""sire"" them."
HOLDEN,Cool.
BUFFY,It's a noun too.
HOLDEN,"(stands, leans on nearby headstone) Oh, I have so much to   learn. Come on, isn't this insane? I mean, I was afraid to talk to you in high   school, and now we're, like, mortal enemies. Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we   became nemeses?"
BUFFY,Is that how you say the word?
HOLDEN,"We're gonna have to fight to the death, aren't we?"
BUFFY,It's the time-honored custom.
HOLDEN,"Wow, reality just shows up sometimes, doesn't it? But, you   know, I've got the bloodlust pumping, and I kinda get it. I'm looking for a   fight. And, oh, it's nothing personal."
BUFFY,"(stands) Oh, no, I mean, you've been great."
HOLDEN,"And fun catching up. I haven't really kept in contact with   many of my friends from high school. Guess I'll be looking them up pretty   soon. (laughs)"
BUFFY,(looks down) Yeah.
HOLDEN,"Hey, I don't mean to be Count Buttinsky here, but you just   don't seem as thrilled. Is it because we're gonna fight?"
BUFFY,'S 'cause I'm gonna win.
HOLDEN,"(laughs) Hello. Two years of Tae Kwon Do and vampire   strength. I think somebody's counting their chickens."
BUFFY,"You're not leaving this graveyard. (shrugs) Can't let   ya."
HOLDEN,"Do the words ""superiority complex"" mean anything to   you?"
BUFFY,"You think I'm gonna let you go kill a bunch of people? You   know I'm sworn to"
HOLDEN,"No, no. I get the battle against evil. That's not the   issue"
BUFFY,There is no issue. Don't issue me.
HOLDEN,"Just answer me this: whose fault was your parents   divorce?"
BUFFY,"(rolls eyes) OK, you know, this is beyond evil. This is   insane troll logic. What do my parents have to do with?"
HOLDEN,(sits on sarcophagus) I'm just curious. Your opinion.
BUFFY,"(sighs, sits on sarcophagus next to him) They both have a   lot of"
HOLDEN,Off the top of your head.
BUFFY,(hangs head) My dad.
HOLDEN,Uh-huh.
BUFFY,"He cheated. Um, I think he cheated."
HOLDEN,"So, of all of these relationships of yoursthat you knew   subconsciously were totally doomedWhose fault is that?"
BUFFY,It's incredibly different.
HOLDEN,"I was just wondering, (stands) is it possible, even a   little bit, that the reason you have trouble connecting to guys is because you   think maybe they're not worth it? Maybe you think you're better than them."
BUFFY,"(glares) Say, there's that bloodlust I was looking for."
HOLDEN,Struck a nerve.
BUFFY,"I'm gonna strike a nerve cluster in a minute, you don't get   off this. I don't remember you being this annoying."
HOLDEN,You don't remember me at all.
BUFFY,"Yes, I do."
HOLDEN,"Yeah, like, after 30 minutes of reminding. And I don't   take it personally because clearly you were in your own little world in high   school. All chosen. All destiny. Who could live with that for seven years and   not feel superior?"
BUFFY,"I'm not. My God, if anything, I (hangs head)"
HOLDEN,What?
BUFFY,"I just(sighs) if you knew what I've done, what I've let   myself become. My best friends don't evenYou'd laugh, you heard some of the   things I've done to them."
HOLDEN,"(sits on nearby headstone) Buffy, I'm here to kill you,   not to judge you."
BUFFY,"The last guy I was with, it got really I behaved like a   monster, treated him like But at the same time, I-I let him completely take   me over. Do things to me that (starts to cry, Holden stands) I'm sorry.   (wipes eyes) Wow, I didn't mean to get all true-confessions there. I don't   know what's wrong with me."
HOLDEN,There's nothing wrong with you.
HOLDEN,"Everyone's got issues. (growls and goes to her neck, fangs   bared)"
BUFFY,(pauses) You son of a bitch!
HOLDEN,(stands) What?
BUFFY,"I think I'm gonna kill you just a little bit more than   usual. (she punches, he blocks then kicks her)"
HOLDEN,"Aw, come one. I mean, we had a moment. You opened up. It   was really sweet. It make me want to bite you. I'm sorry if I overstepped my   bounds. I'm just new to this mortal enemy stuff. (she stands, he kicks her)   Pretty fast learner, though, right?"
DAWN,"I hear you. I hear you breathing. Are you hurting my mother?   Are you keeping her from coming back to me?"
DAWN,"Mom? I see you. I'm coming towards you, OK?"
DAWN,"She's trying to talk to me. Get off her and let her talk to   me! (to herself) The axe!"
DAWN,No! (shuts door) She's my mother. I'm staying.
JONATHAN,"Seeing the high school again, part of me wishes I could   go back."
ANDREW,"Everything's shifting around. I feel like we're in   Hellraiser. I hate Pinhead."
JONATHAN,"Let me see that. (takes map) Did we circle all the way   around? Maybe we should start over"
ANDREW,(points to the door) There it is.
JONATHAN,"Are you sure? (shines flashlight on door. Warren has   vanished, and there's no one there)"
ANDREW,Yeah. (sees Warren still standing there)
JONATHAN,"You know, I think you may be right. If this lines up,   what we're looking for should be right under there."
BUFFY,See? You're dead. That enough of a moment for ya?
HOLDEN,"(changes from vamp visage to human face) OK. But are you   killing me 'cause I'm evil or because you opened up?"
BUFFY,"(sighs, stands) Uhh! (he tries to get up and she kicks him   in the face. he laughs) What is wrong with you?"
HOLDEN,"(stands) Nothing. I got no worries. I'm dead. The biggest   thing on my mind is whether or not Tricia Waldman came to my funeral or not.   Do you remember her? Ohhbiteable."
BUFFY,"See, this is what I hate about you vampires. Sex and death   and love and painit's all the same damn thing to you."
HOLDEN,"(walks around) Well, you know it'sit's kind of a guy   thing. We talk about nailing a girl, there's all this"
BUFFY,"No, it is not the same. With vampires, it is completely   Believe me, I know."
HOLDEN,"(stops) Oh, my God!"
BUFFY,"Oh, your God what?"
HOLDEN,"Oh, well, you know, not my God, because I defy him and all   of his works, butDoes he exist? Is there word on that, by the way?"
BUFFY,Nothing solid.
HOLDEN,"Oh. I keep getting off topic because my mind is racing   here. (takes off jacket) All right. I'll make a deal with you. We fight. To   the death. Great. That last fight was just exhilarating. And I actually had a   move coming up to block that stake. (walks toward Buffy) But you have to   answer one question, and if I'm right, I get to ask anythingno secrets, no   defensiveness, anything I want to know."
BUFFY,What's your question?
HOLDEN,Your last relationshipwas it with a vampire?
WILLOW,"I don't know where to start. Um, after Warren shot youyou   know all about that, what happened? It was horrible. I was horrible. II lost   myself, the regular me."
CASSIE,"Well, you were grieving."
WILLOW,"A lot of people grieve. They don't make with the flaying.   I hurt so many people."
CASSIE,It was the power.
WILLOW,"I am the power. It's in me. Did I mention the random   destruction of property? The Magic Box is not so much a box now"
CASSIE,The power is bigger than you are.
WILLOW,"I know, but"
CASSIE,"Things are more clear where Tara is, where we are. We can   see your path, and you have to stop. You can't use magic again, not ever."
WILLOW,"Black magic, of course. But Giles says it isn't as simple   as-as quitting it all cold-turkey"
CASSIE,"It's too dangerous. You can't take the chance that you'll   lose control."
WILLOW,"I-I don't want to. I-I can't. I never want to cause that   kind of pain."
CASSIE,Of course you don't.
WILLOW,"So, I won't. I'm gonna be OK."
CASSIE,She says...
WILLOW,What?
CASSIE,You're not gonna be OK. You're gonna kill everybody.
JONATHAN,We almost got this thing uncovered.
ANDREW,Yep.
JONATHAN,"I hope Buffy'll know how to destroy it. (stops digging)   36-19-27! That's it! That was my locker combination. (digs) God, it's been   bugging me all night."
ANDREW,"Dude, we spent the last few years trying to forget about   high school. Why are you trying so hard to remember it?"
JONATHAN,I don't know. I guess I miss it. Don't you?
ANDREW,"Yeah, I really miss it."
JONATHAN,"(stops digging) No, I'm serious. I really miss it. Time   goes by, and everything drops away. (Andrew stops digging, looks at Jonathan)   All the cruelty, all the pain, all that humiliation. It all washes away."
JONATHAN,"I miss my friends. I miss my enemies. I miss the people   I talked to every day. I miss the people who never knew I existed. I miss 'em   all. I want to talk to them, you know. I want to find out how they're doing. I   want to know what's going on in their lives."
ANDREW,"You know what? They don't wanna talk to youall those   people you just mentioned. Not one of them is sitting around going, ""I wonder   what Jonathan's up to right now."" Not one of them cares about you."
JONATHAN,"Well, I still care about them. That's why I'm here."
DAWN,"I know you're there. I will cast you out. My mother needs to   talk to me."
DAWN,"I cast you from this place. (sprinkles dust) It is your   poison and your bane. (sprinkles dust)"
DAWN,(sprinkles dust) It is the skin that is cut from your flesh!
BUFFY,"And the joke is... he loved me. I mean, in his own sick,   soulless way, he really did care for me. But I-I didn't want to be loved."
HOLDEN,Didn't you?
BUFFY,"I have all this power. I didn't ask for it. I don't deserve   it. It's like... I wanted to be punished. I wanted to hurt like I thought I   deserved. I sorta thinkyou know, this is, um, complicated. If you'd rather   just fight..."
HOLDEN,(leans back) Tell me.
BUFFY,"I feel like I'm worse than anyone. Honestly, I'm beneath   them. My friends, my boyfriends. I feel like I'm not worthy of their love.   'Cause even though they love me, it doesn't mean anything 'cause their   opinions don't matter. They don't know. They haven't been through what I've   been through. They're not the slayer. I am. Sometimes I feel(sighs) this is   awfulI feel like I'm better than them. Superior."
HOLDEN,"Until you can't win. And I thought I was diabolicalor, at   least I plan to be. You do have a superiority complex. And you've got an   inferiority complex about it. (laughs) Kudos."
BUFFY,It doesn't make any sense.
HOLDEN,"(sits forward) Oh, it makes every kind of sense. And it   all adds up to you feeling alone. But, Buffy, everybody feels alone. Everybody   is, until you die. Speaking of...(stands) you ready for our little death   match?"
BUFFY,"I suppose. (stands) Thanks, for listening."
HOLDEN,"Oh, you know, there's some things you can only tell a   stranger."
BUFFY,You're not a stranger. That stuff with Spike is pretty
HOLDEN,Hold it.
BUFFY,What?
HOLDEN,Did you say Spike?
DAWN,"I cast you out with every prayer from every god that walked   the Earth and crawled beneath. (thrown across the room, landing on her butt,   she continues. her mouth is bloody) I cast you out with the strength of those   who love me. (stands) I cast your out with the strength I have inside me! I   cast you out into the void. (throws bowl forward) That's right! Die, you   bastard!"
DAWN,Mom?
WILLOW,I'm gonna what?
CASSIE,That's why I came. We needed to warn you.
WILLOW,"You saw my path? W-what do you know? Whatwhat did you   see?"
CASSIE,You don't want to know what we saw.
WILLOW,"Oh, God!"
CASSIE,But if you stopcompletely. No more magic.
WILLOW,"Right. Right. Stop. W-what about Giles? He made it seem   like it was just as dangerous for me to quit completely, like I'll go off the   deep end again"
CASSIE,You can't. If you do so much as another spell
WILLOW,I tried to stop. I-I tried. What if I can't do this?
CASSIE,Don't think that way.
WILLOW,"Well, how can I not? You're telling me I'm gonna murder   all my friends. I'm not strong. I'm not an Amazon. I'm just me."
CASSIE,"Well, there is one thingone thing you could do to stop   it."
WILLOW,(eyes wide) What? Anything.
CASSIE,"And you could see her. You wouldn't have to talk through   me."
WILLOW,(softly) Tara?
CASSIE,"That's what you want, isn't it?"
WILLOW,Of course.
CASSIE,"So go. Be with her. Everybody will be safe, and you'll be   together again. It's not that bad. Really. It's just like going to sleep."
WILLOW,Who are you?
BUFFY,What do you mean? How do you know Spike?
HOLDEN,"What do you mean, how? He was the guy that, umoh, what's   the word?"
BUFFY,Sired.
HOLDEN,"Yeah, he was the guy that sired me."
JOYCE,"Things are coming, Dawn. Listen, things are on their way. I   love you, and I love Buffy, but she won't be there for you."
DAWN,What? Why are you?
JOYCE,"When it's bad, Buffy won't choose you. She'll be against   you."
DAWN,"No! No, don't go! Please, don't go!"
CASSIE,"Suicide thing was too far, huh? Hmm. You seemed so ripe."
WILLOW,Tell me who you are.
CASSIE,"(leans forward) I stand by my opinion. The world would be   a better place if you took a razorblade to your wrist"
WILLOW,Stop.
CASSIE,"I can see it now. (stands) Candlelight, the Indigo Girls   playing, picture of your dead girlfriend on your bloody lap."
WILLOW,Stop it!
CASSIE,"(mocking) Oh, baby, you left such a big hole. It hurt so   bad. (serious, leans in) You don't know hurt.
