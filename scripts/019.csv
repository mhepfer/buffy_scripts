character,dialogue
James,"C'mon, Mom. She's always late."
Drusilla,Are you lost?
James,(looks back at her) No. My mom's just supposed to pick me up is  all. (climbs out of the gym)
Drusilla,Do you want me to walk you home?
James,"No, thank you."
Drusilla,(touches the gym) My mummy used to sing me to sleep at night.  (slowly walks around the gym as she sings) Run and catch / The lamb is  caught in the blackberry patch... She had the sweetest voice. What will  your mummy sing when they find your body?
James,(looks at her nervously) I'm not supposed to talk to people.
Drusilla,"Oh. Well, I'm not a person, see, so that's just..."
Angel,"(to the boy, sternly) Run home."
Drusilla,My Angel!
Angel,"Hello, Drusilla."
Drusilla,(slowly approaches) Do you remember the song mummy used to  sing me? Pretty.
Angel,I remember.
Drusilla,"(senses) Yes, you do."
Angel,"Drusilla, leave here. I'm offering you that chance. Take Spike  and get out."
Drusilla,Or you'll hurt me?
Drusilla,"(senses) No. No, you can't. Not anymore."
Angel,If you don't leave it'll go badly. For all of us.
Drusilla,"My dear boy's gone all away, hasn't he? To her."
Angel,Who?
Drusilla,The girl. The Slayer.
Drusilla,Your heart stinks of her. (puts her hand on his chest) Poor  little thing. (cut to Buffy) She has no idea what's in store.
Angel,"This can't go on, Drusilla. It's gotta end."
Drusilla,"Oh, no, my pet. This is just the beginning."
Jenny,It's a secret!
Giles,What kind of a secret?
Jenny,"Uh, the kind that's secret. You know, where I don't actually  tell you what it is."
Giles,"I think it's customary that when two people are going out on an  evening that they, they both have an idea of where they're going."
Jenny,"Oh, come on! Where is your sense of adventure?"
Giles,"Well, I, I... Uh, how will I know what to wear?"
Jenny,(looks at his tweed suit) Do you own anything else?
Giles,"Uh, w-well, not as such, no, um..."
Jenny,"(laughs) Rupert, you're gonna have to trust me."
Giles,"Alright, alright, I p-put myself in your hands."
Jenny,"That sounds like fun. (starts on her way) Okay, tomorrow night,  7:30, right?"
Giles,Yes.
Buffy,Hey.
Giles,"Hello. (they start to the library) Um, did we hunt last night?"
Buffy,I did a couple quick sweeps downtown.
Giles,Any encounters?
Buffy,Nothing vampirey.
Giles,"Uh, I've been researching your friend Spike. Uh, the profile is  fairly unappetizing. But I-I still haven't got a bead on why he's here."
Buffy,You'll figure it out.
Giles,You alright? You seem a little glum.
Buffy,I'm fine.
Giles,Why don't you take the night off?
Buffy,Okay. That'd be nice.
Giles,Yes. You could spend some time with Angel.
Buffy,I don't know. He might have other plans.
Note,Do you know who she was?
Boy,"Well, it seems like Louis XVI was just sort of a weak king."
Teacher,"That's fair enough. Uh, any other impressions?"
Cordelia,"I just don't see why everyone's always picking on Marie  Antoinette. I can so relate to her. She worked really hard to look that  good, and people just don't appreciate that kind of effort."
Answer,No  Dark hair  Old dress  <u>pretty</u>
Cordelia,And I know the peasants were all depressed...
Xander,I think you mean 'oppressed'.
Cordelia,Whatever. They were cranky.
Cordelia,"So they're, like, 'Let's lose some heads'. Uhhh! That's fair.  And, and Marie Antoinette cared about them. She was gonna let them have  cake!"
Teacher,"Yes, well, that's a very interesting perspective."
Teacher,"Um, would anyone else like to comment?"
Note,Vampire?
Buffy,I don't know. I don't think so. They seemed pretty friendly.
Xander,Who's friendly?
Buffy,No one.
Willow,Angel and a girl.
Buffy,"Willow, do we have to be in total share mode?"
Xander,"Hey, it's me. If Angel's doing somethin' wrong, I wanna know.  'Cause it gives me a happy! (smiles)"
Buffy,"Mm, I'm glad someone has a happy."
Xander,"Aw, you just need cheering up. And I know just the thing! (does  a wild move) Crazed dance party at the Bronze!"
Buffy,"I dunno. (crosses her arms, depressed)"
Xander,Very calm dance party at the Bronze? (Buffy gives him a glum  look) Moping at the Bronze.
Ford,"I'd suggest a box of Oreos dunked in apple juice, but maybe she's  over that phase."
Buffy,Ford?
Ford,"Hey, Summers!"
Ford,How ya been?
Buffy,"Oh, my God! What are you doing here?"
Ford,"Uh, matriculating."
Buffy,Huh?
Ford,I'm finishing out my senior year at Sunnydale High. Dad got  transferred.
Buffy,This is great!
Ford,I'm glad you think so.
Ford,I didn't think you'd remember me.
Buffy,Remember you? Duh! We only went to school together for seven  years. You were my giant fifth grade crush.
Xander,So! You two know each other.
Buffy,"Oh! (turns to Xander and Willow) I'm sorry. Um, this is Ford!  Uh, Billy Fordham, this is Xander and Willow!"
Xander,Hi.
Ford,Hey.
Willow,Nice to meet you!
Buffy,"Uh, Ford and I went to Hemery together in L.A. (to Ford) And now  you're here. For real?"
Ford,"Dad got the transfer, and boom, he just dragged me outta Hemery  and put me down here."
Buffy,"This is great! Well, I mean, it's hard, sudden move, all your  friends, delicate time, very emotional, but let's talk about me! (puts  her hand on his knee) This is great!"
Willow,"(smiles) So, you two were sweeties in fifth grade?"
Buffy,Not even. Ford wouldn't give me the time of day.
Ford,"Well, I was a manly sixth-grader. I couldn't bother with someone  that young."
Buffy,It was terrible. I moped over you for months. Sitting in my room  listening to that Divinyls song 'I Touch Myself'.
Buffy,"Of course, I had no idea what it was about."
Buffy,"(to Ford) Hey, are you busy tonight? We're going to the Bronze,  it's the local club, and you have to come."
Ford,I'd love to! But if you guys already had plans... Would I be  imposing?
Xander,"No, only in the literal sense."
Ford,"Okay, then! I, I gotta find the admissions office, (gets up) uh,  get my papers in order."
Buffy,"Well, you know what, (gets up) I'll take you there, and I'll see  you guys in French! (takes Ford's arm)"
Ford,It was good to meet you. (they go)
Xander,"(sarcastically) This is Ford, my bestest friend of all my  friends! Jeez, doesn't she know any fat guys?"
Willow,"(realizes) Oh, that's what that song is about?!"
Buffy,Ford! You made it.
Ford,Wasn't hard to find.
Willow,"Buffy, Ford was just telling us about the ninth grade beauty  contest, and the, uh, swimsuit competition."
Buffy,"Oh, my God, Ford, stop that! The more people you tell, the more  people I have to kill."
Ford,"You can't touch me, Summers. I know all your darkest secrets."
Xander,Care to make a small wager on that?
Buffy,"I'm gonna go get a drink. Ford, try not to talk."
Buffy,Hi.
Angel,Hey! I was hoping you'd show.
Buffy,"(sees he has a drink) You drink! I mean, drinks. Non-blood  things."
Angel,There's a lot about me you don't know.
Buffy,I believe that.
Willow,That's Angel.
Xander,He's Buffy's beau. (sarcastically) Her special friend.
Ford,"He's not in school, right? He looks older than her."
Xander,You're not wrong.
Buffy,So. What'd you do last night?
Angel,Nothin'.
Buffy,Nothing at all. You ceased to exist?
Angel,"No, I mean I stayed in, read."
Buffy,Oh.
Ford,Didn't want that soda after all?
Buffy,Not thirsty.
Willow,"Hey, Angel."
Ford,Hi.
Buffy,(turns to Angel) This is Ford. We went to school together in  L.A.
Angel,Nice to meet you. (shakes Ford's hand)
Ford,Whoa! Cold hands!
Xander,You're not wrong.
Angel,"So, you're here visiting Buffy?"
Ford,"No, I'm actually here to stay. Just moved down."
Willow,"Hey, Angel? Do you wanna play?"
Buffy,"Y'know, it's getting really crowded in here tonight. Um... I'm a  little hot. (to Ford) You wanna take a walk?"
Ford,"Um, sure! That'd be nice."
Buffy,"Okay, then, um... (to the others) I'll see ya tomorrow. (leads  Ford out past Angel)"
Angel,Good night.
Ford,Take care.
Xander,"Okay, once more with tension."
Angel,He just moved here?
Xander,"Yeah. And, boy, does he move fast."
Willow,"Well, Angel, we could still play."
Willow,"See, you made him do that thing where he's gone."
Ford,"So, that was your boyfriend?"
Buffy,"No. Uh, yeah. Maybe. Could we lay off the tough questions for a  while?"
Ford,Sorry. So! What else do you do for fun around here?
Buffy,"Um, my purse. I-I, I left my purse at the Bronze. Uh, could you  get it for me?"
Ford,"Uh, okay. (heads back)"
Buffy,Good. Run! Thanks!
Ford,What's goin' on?
Buffy,"Um... uh, there was a, a cat. A cat here, and, um, then there  was a-another cat... and they fought. The cats. And... then they left."
Ford,Oh. I thought you were just slaying a vampire.
Buffy,What? Whating a what?
Ford,"I know, Buffy. You don't have to lie. I-I've been trying to  figure out the right time to, to tell you. I know you're the Slayer."
Willow,Just like that he told you?
Buffy,Just like that. (cut to her room) Said he found out right before  I got booted from Hemery.
Willow,Wow! (cut to her) It's neat! Is it neat?
Buffy,"(cut to her) Yeah, I guess it is. I don't have to constantly  worry that he's gonna find out my dark secret. It just makes everything  easier."
Lyrics,<I>I had a face on the mirror / I had a hand on the gun</I>
Diego,"Ford? Hi, Ford?"
Ford,Hey!
Diego,"Well, how'd it go?"
Ford,It went good.
Diego,"Good? That's, that's it? That's all we know? Well, when are  we..."
Ford,(interrupts) Soon.
Diego,"Oh, soon, okay. Y'know, you could gimme a little more  information here. I'm trusting you. I'm out on a limb here. Not to  mention the lease is almost up on this place. Who's gonna cover that?"
Ford,Marvin...
Diego,"Diego! C'mon, man, it's Diego now."
Ford,Diego. (takes out a pill) Ritalin. Everything's gonna be fine.
Ford,Just make sure you're ready when I say. True believers only.
Chantarelle,(smiles) I can't wait!
Diego,"Right, whatever, I still think I should be in on the plan."
Ford,"Diego, you gotta trust me."
TV,Alright.
Ford,"A couple more days and we'll get to do the two things every  American teen should have the chance to do: die young, and stay pretty."
Jack,"So... You play your wits against mine. Me, who commanded armies  hundreds of years before you were born. Fools!"
Willow,Oh! (opens the door) Angel! What are you doing here?
Angel,I wanted to talk to you.
Willow,"(looks around) Oh, well..."
Willow,Well?
Angel,"I can't. Unless you invite me, I can't come in."
Willow,"Oh! (nervous) Well, okay, I invite you. To come in."
Angel,"I-if this is a bad time, I..."
Willow,No! I just... I'm not supposed to have boys in my room.
Angel,I promise to behave myself.
Willow,(still nervous) Okay. Good.
Angel,I guess I need help.
Willow,"Help? You mean like on homework? No, 'cause you're old and you  already know stuff."
Angel,I want you to track someone down. On the 'Net. (eyes her laptop)
Willow,(smiles) Oh! Great! I'm so the 'Net girl. (goes to sit at her  desk)
Angel,"I just wanna find everything I can. Records, affiliates, I'm not  even sure what I'm looking for yet."
Willow,(types) Good. What's the name?
Angel,Billy Fordham.
Willow,"Uh, Angel? If I say something you really don't wanna hear,  (faces him) do you promise not to bite me?"
Angel,Are you gonna tell me that I'm jealous?
Willow,"Well, you do sometimes get that way."
Angel,"You know, I never used to. (sits on her bed) Things used to be  pretty simple. (Willow types) A hundred years, just hanging out, feelin'  guilty... I really honed my brooding skills. Then she comes along.  (Willow faces him again) Yeah, I get jealous. But I know people. And my  gut tells me this is a wrong guy."
Willow,"(nods) Okay. (turns back to the laptop) But if there isn't  anything weird... Hey, that's weird."
Angel,What?
Willow,"I just checked the school records, and he's not in them. (Angel  stands up) I mean, usually they transfer your grades and stuff, but he's  not even registered."
Angel,"He said he was in school with you guys, right?"
Willow,Let me just see if I can...
Willow,"(gets up) (to Angel) Ack! Go! (to her mom) Iiiiiii'm just going  to bed now, mom!"
Willow,Come by tomorrow at sunset. I'll keep looking.
Angel,"Don't tell Buffy what we're doing, alright?"
Willow,You want me to lie to her? It's Buffy!
Angel,Just don't bring it up until we know what's what.
Willow,Okay. I-it's probably nothing.
Angel,That'd be nice.
Buffy,Willow!
Buffy,What's up?
Willow,Nothing.
Buffy,Do you wanna hang? We're cafeteria-bound.
Willow,"(jumpy) I-I-I'm gonna do work in the computer lab on school  work that I have, so I cannot hang just now. Hi, Ford."
Ford,Morning.
Buffy,"Okay, Will, fess up."
Willow,What?
Buffy,Are you drinking coffee again? 'Cause we've talked about this.
Willow,It makes me jumpy. I have to go. Away. (hurries off)
Ford,Nice girl!
Buffy,There aren't two of those in the world.
Giles,"Buffy! Um... Yes, uh... (sets down his briefcase and searches  his pockets) Ms. Calendar and I are going... somewhere tonight, and  she's given, (finds the slip of paper) oh, given me the number of her  beeper thingy, uh, in case you need me for, um... (eyes Ford) study  help, uh, suddenly. (picks up his briefcase)"
Buffy,"He knows, Giles."
Giles,What?
Buffy,Ford (indicates him) knows I'm the Slayer.
Ford,I know.
Giles,"Oh! Uh, very good, yes. Uh, um, Buffy... (leads Buffy aside) (to  Ford) Excuse me. (aside to Buffy) You are not, by any chance, betraying  your secret identity just to impress, um, cute boys, are you?"
Buffy,(smiles) I didn't tell him. He knew.
Giles,"Oh! Uh, right then. Well, uh, just remember, if you..."
Buffy,Go! Experience this thing called fun. I'll try not to have a  crisis.
Buffy,"And on your right, once again, the beautiful campus. I think  you've now seen everything there is to see in Sunnydale."
Ford,"Well, it's... really..."
Buffy,Feel free to say dull.
Ford,"Okay. Dull's good. (sees two vampires running) Or maybe not so  dull. (Buffy sees them, too) Is that more vampires?"
Buffy,Must be the weather.
Buffy,Stay close to me.
Ford,Maybe they were just passing through.
Buffy,(turns around) I don't think so.
Ford,"You've got one chance to live. Tell me what I wanna know, and  I'll let you go."
Buffy,Where's the other one?
Ford,"I killed her. (coughs) I, I killed her and she just turned to  dust. It was... amazing!"
Willow,The only thing I could track down was this address. The Sunset  Club. Still didn't find anything incriminating.
Angel,"He leaves no paper trail, no records, that's incriminating  enough."
Xander,"Yeah, I'm gonna have to go with Dead Boy on this one."
Angel,Could you *not* call me that?
Angel,We're friends of Ford's.
Willow,"(wearing a colorfully striped shirt) Boy, we blend right in."
Xander,In no way do we stick out like sore thumbs.
Angel,Let's look around. You guys check out downstairs.
Xander,"Sure thing, Bossy the cow! (they start down)"
Willow,"Okay, but do they really stick out?"
Xander,What?
Willow,"Sore thumbs. Do they stick out? I mean, have you ever seen a  thumb and gone, 'Wow! That baby is sore!'"
Xander,You have too many thoughts.
Lyrics,<I>The one hungry life / My life with the other</I>
Man,(waves) Hi!
Xander,Are you probably noticing a theme here?
Willow,As in 'Vampires! Yay!'?
Xander,That's the one.
Chantarelle,You guys are newbies. I can tell.
Willow,"(turns to face her) Oh, no. We come here all the time."
Chantarelle,Don't be ashamed! It's cool that you're open to it. We  welcome anyone who's interested in the Lonely Ones.
Willow,The Lonely Ones?
Angel,Vampires.
Xander,"Oh! We usually call them the nasty, pointy, bitey ones."
Chantarelle,So many people have that misconception. But they who walk  with the night are not interested in harming anyone. They are creatures  above us. Exalted!
Angel,You're a fool.
Chantarelle,"You don't have to be so confrontational about it. Other  viewpoints than yours may be valid, you know. (goes away)"
Willow,Nice meeting you.
Xander,You really are a people person.
Willow,Now nobody's gonna talk to us.
Angel,"I've seen enough. I've seen this type before. I mean, they're  children making up bedtime stories of friendly vampires to comfort  themselves in the dark."
Willow,"Is that so bad? I mean, the dark can get pretty dark. Sometimes  you need a story."
Angel,"These people don't know anything about vampires. What they are,  how they live, how they dress..."
Xander,"You know, I love a good diatribe. But I'm still curious why  Ford, the bestest friend of the Slayer, is hanging with a bunch of  vampire wannabes."
Willow,"Something's up with him, you're right about that."
Girl,Are you okay?
Buffy,"Sorry to beep you guys in the middle of... stuff, but it seemed  really weird."
Giles,"No, you did the right thing. Absolutely."
Jenny,(stops in her tracks) You hated it that much?
Giles,"No! But, but, uh, vampires on campus is, could have  implications. Very, very grave..."
Jenny,You coulda just said something.
Giles,"Uh, honestly, I, I've always, I've always been interested in,  in, uh, monster trucks."
Buffy,You took him to monster trucks?
Jenny,I thought it would be a change!
Giles,It was a change.
Jenny,"Look, we could've just left."
Giles,"Wha-what, and miss the nitro-burning funny cars? No, couldn't  have that."
Buffy,"Okay, can we get back on the vampire tip here? These guys were  here with a purpose."
Giles,"Yes, yes, and, uh, we must, uh, ascertain what that purpose is."
Jenny,Where's your friend?
Buffy,I sent him home.
Giles,"(sits at the table) Oh, uh, good. Yes, the less he's involved in  all this, the safer he'll be."
Buffy,He did bag a vamp his first time out.
Buffy,Gotta give him credit for... (notices the picture) that.
Jenny,Something wrong?
Buffy,(picks up the picture) Who's this?
Giles,"Um, she's called Drusilla, a sometime paramour of Spike's. She  was killed by an angry mob in Prague."
Buffy,"Well, they don't make angry mobs like they used to, 'cause this  girl's alive. I saw her with Angel."
Giles,(taken aback) With Angel?
Jenny,Isn't he supposed to be a good guy?
Buffy,(puts the picture back down) Yeah. He is.
Jenny,I think maybe we need to read up on this nice lady.
Giles,"(gets up and heads for his office) Well, some of my new volumes  may be more helpful. Uh, my own research is..."
Jenny,Are you guys okay?
Giles,A book! It took one of my books!
Jenny,"Well, at least someone in this school is reading."
Buffy,He said he killed it. That's the vampire Ford said he killed.
Drusilla,"You sing the sweetest little song. Won't you sing for me,  hmm? Don't you love me anymore?"
Spike,Darling! I heard a funny thing just now. Lucius tells me that  you went out on a hunt the other night.
Drusilla,My tummy was growly. And you were out. (to the bird) Come on.  (whistles) I'll pout if you don't sing.
Spike,"(puts his arms around her) You, um, meet anyone? Anyone  interesting? Like Angel?"
Drusilla,Angel.
Spike,"Yeah. So... (kisses her forehead) What might you guys have  talked about, then? Old times? Childhood pranks? It's a little off, you  two so friendly, him being the enemy and all that."
Drusilla,(to the bird) I'll give you a seed if you sing.
Spike,"The bird's dead, Dru. You left it in a cage, and you didn't feed  it, and now it's all dead, just like the last one."
Spike,"Oh, I'm sorry baby. I'm a bad, rude man. I just don't like you  goin' out, that's all. You are weak. (takes her hand) Would you like a  new bird? One that's not dead? (sucks on her finger)"
Ford,This is so cool!
Ford,I would totally live here.
Spike,"(loudly) Do I have anyone on watch here? It's called security,  people. Are you all asleep? (walks toward Ford) Or did we finally find a  restaurant that delivers?"
Ford,I know who you are.
Spike,"Yeah, I know who I am, too. So what?"
Ford,"I came looking for you, Spike. You are Spike, right? William the  Bloody?"
Spike,You've got a real death wish. It's almost interesting.
Spike,"Oh, this is great. This'll be very useful. (to Ford) So, how did  you find me?"
Ford,That doesn't matter. I've got something to offer you. I-I'm  pretty sure this is the part where you take out a watch and say I've got  thirty seconds to convince you not to kill me? (smiles) It's  traditional.
Spike,"Well, (slams the book and strides to Ford) I don't go much for  tradition."
Drusilla,"Wait, love."
Spike,Well?
Ford,"Oh, c'mon! Say it! It's no fun if you don't say it."
Spike,What? Oh. (rolls his eyes and bobs his head) You've got thirty  seconds to convince me not to kill you.
Ford,"Yes! See, this is the best! I wanna be like you. A vampire."
Spike,"I've known you for two minutes, and I can't stand you. I don't  really feature you livin' forever. (to Drusilla) Can I eat him now,  love?"
Ford,"Well, feature this: I'm offering you a trade. (Spike turns back)  You make me a vampire, and I give you the Slayer."
Angel,Buffy. May I come in?
Buffy,(looks up) Sure. I thought once you were invited you could  always just walk in.
Angel,I can. I was just being polite. (closes the door) We need to  talk.
Buffy,Do we? (picks up her coffee and heads into the dining room)
Angel,It's about your friend Ford. He's not what he seems.
Buffy,Who is these days?
Angel,Willow ran him down on the computer.
Buffy,Willow?
Angel,"We found this address, we checked it out with Xander, and it  turned out..."
Buffy,(disbelieving) And Xander? Wow. Everybody's in. It's like a  great big exciting conspiracy.
Angel,What are you talking about?
Buffy,I'm talking about the people I trust. Who's Drusilla?
Buffy,And don't lie to me. I'm tired of it.
Angel,Some lies are necessary.
Buffy,For what?
Angel,"Sometimes the truth is worse. You live long enough, you find  that out."
Buffy,I can take it. I can take the truth.
Angel,Do you love me?
Buffy,What?
Angel,Do you?
Buffy,I love you. I don't know if I trust you.
Angel,Maybe you shouldn't do either. (turns away)
Buffy,Maybe I'm the one who should decide!
Angel,"I did a lot of unconscionable things when I became a vampire.  (turns back, but doesn't make eye contact) Drusilla was the worst. She  was... an obsession of mine. She was pure and sweet and chaste..."
Buffy,And you made her a vampire.
Angel,"First I made her insane. (looks at her) Killed everybody she  loved. Visited every mental torture on her I could devise. (Buffy looks  away) She eventually fled to a convent, and on the day she took her holy  orders, I turned her into a demon."
Buffy,Well. I asked for the truth.
Angel,"Ford's part of some society that reveres vampires. Practically  worships them. I don't know what he wants from you, but you can't trust  him."
Ford,Buffy!
Buffy,Ford.
Ford,"I had a great time last night. Well, an interesting time."
Buffy,(arms crossed) I'm glad.
Ford,Do you wanna go out again tonight?
Buffy,Not busy.
Ford,I sort of had an idea. It's a... It's a secret. Kinda wanna  surprise you.
Buffy,I like surprises.
Ford,Can you meet me here?
Buffy,Sure.
Ford,At nine?
Buffy,At nine.
Ford,(smiles) It's gonna be fun! (walks off)
Willow,(gets up) Buffy!
Willow,"Did, uh, Angel..."
Buffy,He told me everything.
Willow,I'm sorry we kept stuff from you.
Buffy,It's okay. (smiles weakly)
Willow,"When Angel came to my room he was just really concerned for  you, and we didn't wanna say anything in case we were wrong."
Xander,Did you find out what Ford is up to?
Buffy,I will. (walks off)
Xander,Angel was in your bedroom?
Willow,(nods) Ours is a forbidden love.
Ford,(ignoring Diego) Chantarelle. Is everything ready?
Diego,"Of course. It's ready. (trying to get Ford's attention) Hi, I  took care of it. I always take care of it."
Chantarelle,Is it time? Tonight?
Ford,You nervous? (pours goblets of wine)
Chantarelle,Yes. No. I'm ready for the change. Do you really think  they'll bless us?
Ford,(takes a goblet and hands her the other) I know they will.
Ford,Everything's falling into place. (takes a sip of wine)
Diego,What about your friends? Are they comin'?
Ford,What are you talking about?
Diego,Your friends. They came. Last night. Two guys and a girl.
Chantarelle,One was mean.
Ford,"Oh, Christ! Why didn't you tell me about this?"
Diego,"I have to do everything around here. Sorry, Mr. Flawless Plan  Guy, it slipped my mind."
Chantarelle,"It's gonna be alright, isn't it?"
Chantarelle,They're not gonna let us down?
Ford,(the pain passes) It's gonna be fine.
Chantarelle,I need them to bless me.
Ford,It's gonna be fine!
Buffy,No.
Buffy,It's really not.
Ford,(to Diego) It's kinda drafty in here.
Buffy,"(starts down the stairs) I'm sorry, Ford. I just couldn't wait  till tonight! I'm rash and impulsive. It's a flaw."
Ford,We all have flaws.
Buffy,I'm still a little fuzzy on exactly what yours is. I think it  has to do with being a lying scumbag. (reaches him)
Ford,Everybody lies.
Buffy,"What do you want, Ford? What's this all about?"
Ford,I really don't think you'd understand.
Buffy,I don't need to understand. I just need to know.
Ford,I'm gonna be one of them.
Buffy,You wanna be a vampire?
Ford,I'm going to.
Buffy,"You know, vampires are a little picky about who they change  ov... (figures it out) You were gonna offer them a trade!"
Ford,I don't think I wanna talk anymore.
Buffy,"Yeah, well, I still feel awfully chatty! You were gonna give  them me! Tonight!"
Ford,(nods) Yes.
Buffy,You had to know I'd figure it out.
Ford,"Actually, I was counting on it. (smiles)"
Buffy,What's supposed to happen tonight?
Ford,This is *so* cool! It's just like it played in my head. You know  that part where you ask me what's supposed to happen? (snickers) It's  already happening.
Ford,"Rigged up special. Once it's closed, it can only be opened from  the outside. As soon as the sun sets, they'll be comin'."
Buffy,"Ford, if these people are still around when they get here..."
Diego,(interrupts) We'll be changed. All of us.
Chantarelle,We're going to ascend to a new level of consciousness!  Become like them. Like the Lonely Ones.
Ford,"This is the end, Buffy. No one gets outta here alive."
Buffy,There's gotta be another way out of here! (looks around)
Ford,"This is a bomb shelter, Buffy. I knew I wasn't gonna be able to  overpower you. But this is three feet of solid concrete. Trust me when I  say we're in for the long haul."
Buffy,At least let the other people go.
Chantarelle,Why are you fighting this? It's what we want!
Diego,It's our chance for immortality.
Chantarelle,This is a beautiful day. Can't you see that?
Buffy,"What I see is that, right after the sun goes down, Spike and all  of his friends are going to be pigging out at the all-you-can-eat moron  bar."
Diego,"Okay, that's it. I think we should gag her."
Buffy,I think you should try.
Diego,She's an unbeliever. She taints us.
Buffy,"I am trying to save you! You are playing in some serious traffic  here! Do you understand that? You're going to die! And the only hope you  have of surviving this is to get out of this pit right now, and, my God,  could you have a dorkier outfit?"
Ford,"I gotta back her up, D. You look like a big ninny. (his alarm  goes off) 6:27. Sunset."
Spike,"When we get there, everybody spread out. Two men on the door,  first priority's the Slayer, everything else is fair game, and let's  remember to share, people. (meets Drusilla ) Are you sure you're up for  this?"
Drusilla,I want a treat. I need a treat.
Spike,And a special one you'll have. Lucius! (hold up his keys) Bring  the car around.
Ford,"Hey, you never give up, do you?"
Buffy,"No, I don't."
Ford,"That's a good quality in a person. Too many people, they just lay  back and take it, but us..."
Buffy,Us? We have something in common now?
Ford,More than you think.
Buffy,"Yeah, well, let me explain something to you. You're what we call  the bad guy."
Ford,I guess I am! (chuckles)
Buffy,"(looks down at the people) These people aren't gonna get  changed, are they? The rest of them, they're just fodder."
Ford,"Technically, yes. But I'm in. I will become immortal."
Buffy,"Well, I've got a news flash for you, braintrust: that's not how  it works. You die, and a demon sets up shop in your old house, and it  walks, and it talks, and it remembers your life, but it's not you."
Ford,It's better than nothing.
Buffy,And your life is nothing?
Buffy,"Ford, these people don't deserve to die!"
Ford,"Well, neither do I! But apparently no one took that into  consideration, 'cause I'm still dying."
Ford,"I look good, don't I? Well, let me tell you something: (angry)  I've got maybe six months left, and by then what they bury won't even  *look* like me. It'll be bald and shriveled and it'll smell bad. No, I'm  not going out that way."
Ford,"I'm sorry, Summers. Did I screw up your righteous anger riff?  Does the nest of tumors liquefying my brain kinda spoil the fun?"
Buffy,(faces him) I'm sorry. I had no idea. But what you're doing is  still very wrong.
Ford,"Okay, well, you try vomiting for twenty-four hours straight  because the pain in your head is so intense, and *then* we'll discuss  the concept of right and wrong. (points down) These people are sheep.  They wanna be vampires 'cause they're lonely, miserable or bored. I  don't have a choice."
Buffy,"You have a choice. You don't have a good choice, but you have a  choice! You're opting for mass murder here, and nothing you say is gonna  make that okay!"
Ford,You think I need to justify myself to you?
Buffy,"I think this is all part of your little fantasy drama! Isn't  this exactly how you imagined it? You tell me how you've suffered and I  feel sorry for you. Well, I do feel sorry for you, and if those vampires  come in here and start feeding, I'll kill you myself!"
Ford,"You know what, Summers? I really did miss you."
Buffy,"Ford, help me stop this. (silence) Please!"
Buffy,"People, listen to me! (Ford comes after her) This is not the  mothership, people! This is ugly death come to play!"
Spike,Take them all. Save the Slayer for me.
Buffy,Spike!
Spike,Everybody STOP!
Buffy,"Good idea. Now you let everyone out, or your girlfriend fits in  an ashtray."
Drusilla,(frightened) Spike?
Spike,"It's gonna be alright, baby. Let them go!"
Buffy,Down the stairs.
Spike,"Uh, where's the doorknob?"
Buffy,You guys are just in time.
Willow,Are there vampires?
Buffy,"They're contained. They'll get out eventually, though. We should  probably go. We can come back when they're gone."
Xander,Come back for what?
Buffy,(looks back at the entrance) For the body.
Ford,What happened?
Spike,We're stuck in a basement.
Ford,Buffy?
Spike,(comes down to him) She's *not* stuck in the basement.
Ford,"Hey, well, I delivered. I handed her to you."
Spike,"Yes, I suppose you did."
Ford,So? What about my reward?
Buffy,I don't know what I'm supposed to say.
Giles,You needn't say anything.
Buffy,It'd be simpler if I could just hate him. I think he wanted me  to. I think it made it easier for him to be the villain of the piece.  Really he was just scared.
Giles,"Yes, I suppose he was."
Buffy,"Nothing's ever simple anymore. I'm constantly trying to work it  out. Who to love or hate. Who to trust. It's just, like, the more I  know, the more confused I get."
Giles,I believe that's called growing up.
Buffy,"I'd like to stop then, okay?"
Giles,I know the feeling.
Buffy,Does it ever get easy?
Giles,You mean life?
Buffy,Yeah. Does it get easy?
Giles,What do you want me to say?
Buffy,(looks up at him) Lie to me.
Giles,"(considers a moment) Yes, it's terribly simple."
Giles,"The good guys are always stalwart and true, the bad guys are  easily distinguished by their pointy horns or black hats, and, uh, we  always defeat them and save the day. No one ever dies, and everybody  lives happily ever after."
Buffy,Liar.
