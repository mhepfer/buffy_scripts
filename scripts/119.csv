"<blockquote>GILES VOICEOVER",Previously on <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>...
SPIKE,Why won't you sleep with me again?
BUFFY,Because I don't love you.
SPIKE,Like hell.
BUFFY,I thought you were gonna go see Tara.
WILLOW,She's ... seeing someone else.
WILLOW,They're probably just friends.
WILLOW,We should have some coffee some time.
TARA,I'm free tomorrow.
WILLOW,Whoa.
WARREN,"Shut it down, shut it all down!"
WARREN,Is that the camera in the Magic Box?
JONATHAN,Oh my god.
XANDER,Oh god. What is she...
BUFFY,That's enough.
ANYA,"You left me, Xander. At the altar! I don't owe you anything!"
XANDER,So you go out and bang the first body you can find?
SPIKE,It's good enough for Buffy.
XANDER,Shut up and leave her out of-
WILLOW,Tara?
TARA,You can't just ... have coffee and expect-
WILLOW,I know.
TARA,"There's just so much to work through. Trust has to be built again on both sides. Can we just skip it? Can, can you just be kissing me now?"
WILLOW,When did morning happen?
TARA,After the moon went down.
WILLOW,"Mmm, I forgot how good this could feel. Us. Together. (pause) Without the magic."
TARA,There was plenty of magic.
WILLOW,It's getting late.
TARA,(small frown) Wanna get up?
WILLOW,"No! (Tara laughing) Oh god, no. (quietly) I was just thinking about Buffy."
TARA,(frowns) Oh. She still isn't back?
WILLOW,I didn't hear her. She wouldn't talk about what happened at the magic shop when she got home last night. She just wanted to know how close I was to tracing the camera signal back to the Empire of the Nerds. And then she left again.
TARA,I'm sure she'll be okay.
WILLOW,"Yeah, I'm not really worried about her going up against Warren and the others. I know this is going to sound crazy, but ... I think something might be going on. With Spike and Buffy. (Pause) I mean, she looked so hurt when she saw him with Anya. I think maybe-"
TARA,They've been sleeping together.
WILLOW,(laughs) No. I wouldn't go that far.
TARA,"No, I mean she told me they've been sleeping together."
WILLOW,Sleeping together? You mean like the naked kind of together?
TARA,"(sighs) I'm sorry I didn't say anything, but I, I promised her I wouldn't."
WILLOW,(shocked) Does everybody else know? Am I the only one she didn't-
TARA,"God, no. She, she didn't even mean to tell me, it just came out."
WILLOW,(still shocked) How could she hide something like this from me?
TARA,I think she was afraid of the look you'd get on your face. (Willow staring at her) Kinda like the one you're wearing now.
WILLOW,"Oh, no, I'm not ... I'm just trying to understand."
TARA,So is she.
WILLOW,"Wow, she probably really needs someone to talk to."
TARA,Probably.
TARA,"We've been kinda busy, maybe we didn't hear her come home."
WILLOW,Buffy?
DAWN,(OS) She back yet?
WILLOW,"(nervously) Uh, not yet. I'm sure she'll be home soon. Everything's fine, just go back to bed."
DAWN,It's ten o'clock.
WILLOW,(surprised) Oh. Uh...
DAWN,"(comes closer) You don't think she's ... gonna hurt Spike, do you?"
WILLOW,She told you about Spike?
DAWN,It was kinda obvious after last night.
WILLOW,"(covering) Yeah, I totally knew."
DAWN,"It must have hurt so much. To see him and, and, and Anya like that? And poor Xander. Everything is so screwed up."
WILLOW,"It's gonna be all right. It's just ... complicated. You know, when, when people have such strong feelings for each other, sometimes-"
TARA,Is she back yet?
TARA,Oh. Hey.
D,"(starting to smile, delighted) Oh! You and-"
TARA,"(smiling) Uh, that's my cue to put some clothes on. (turning back toward the bedroom)"
DAWN,"No! No no no! I'm totally not here! You guys, you do whatever you want. Um ... I'll go watch TV. (Giggles) Downstairs, really loud! In the basement. Where I can't hear anything. (Squeals) Oh my god!"
DAWN,I love you guys!
Cut to,"Some door somewhere. It explodes inward (toward the camera) and Buffy appears in the doorway, wearing a red leather jacket."
BUFFY,(calls) All right. Let's make this quick.
BUFFY,Fine. But I'm not leaving till we have a little chat.
BUFFY,"Very little, considering the pummeling that needs to occur."
BUFFY,"I mean, guys, helloooo. Slayer here. Did you honestly think I wouldn't find you..."
She discovers the white-board on which the Nerd Herd had written their evil plans. Buffy turns it on its squeaky axle to reveal the surface. All it says now is,"""TOO LATE!"""
BUFFY,"(frowns) Well, that can't be good."
BUFFY,(annoyed) Okay. That's gonna cost ya.
Note,Amber Benson (Tara) appears in the opening credits for the first time.
"Guest Starring Danny Strong, Adam Busch, Tom Lenk, Amy Hathaway, and Nichole Hiltz. Written by Stephen S. DeKnight, directed by",Michael Gershman.
WILLOW,"Okay, we're here, ready for action! Uh, bad guy fighting action. (Giggles)"
BUFFY,"Guys, you didn't have to ... You know, if you still wanna be alone-"
WILLOW,"No. No, we're good. (still with the amorous looks)"
TARA,We're better than good.
BUFFY,Great.
WILLOW,(softly) Super.
BUFFY,Awww.
WILLOW,"Okay, all right, we'll stop."
DAWN,"Oh, you better not!"
TARA,"So, um, nerds. How are them? They?"
BUFFY,"Well, I found their lair, but they obviously knew we were tracing their signal. They left in a hurry. Van was gone, but everything else was still there."
WILLOW,"We should go back, uh, Tara and I can Sherlock around-"
BUFFY,"There's nothing left there now. Giant buzz saw. It was a thing. (indicating papers) This was all that I could save. I, I know it's not much, but we need to go through it and see if we can find anything that might tell us what, what they're doing, where they're going...."
TARA,"Um, (chuckling) this might take a while."
BUFFY,Anything we can do to fast forward? We really need to find Warren and the others before anyone else gets hurt.
WILLOW,Should we call Xander?
BUFFY,(grimaces) I don't think he's really in the Scooby space. We need to give him some time.
DAWN,"Maybe they've heard something in the demon bars about those guys. (tentatively, looking at Buffy) Spike-"
BUFFY,(quickly) Spike .... Spike's not part of the team.
DAWN,(softly) So he's not ... going to be around anymore? (Willow and Tara looking concerned)
BUFFY,"Uh ... I don't know, Dawn. Not, not for a while."
TARA,What about Anya? She might be able to help with some of the demon texts.
BUFFY,I'm guessing she's not feeling real researchy right now.
Cut to,"a restaurant, day. A blonde woman sits at the bar with a martini glass in front of her. She's crying and has her head down so we can't see her face, but her hair and build and clothing resemble Anya's. But as the camera pulls out we see that Anya is actually sitting next to the crying woman."
ANYA,I know how you feel. Maybe I can help.
CRYING WOMAN,How could Carl do that to me? That bastard!
ANYA,He's a man. Look no further.
CRYING WOMAN,But with my sister? She's not even pretty.
ANYA,(taken aback) Well ... it isn't always about looks. (Crying woman looking skeptical) Or a beating heart. Sometimes  intimate sweaty relations with the wrong person just seems like a good idea at the time.
CRYING WOMAN,(angrily) She's fat! He cheated on me with my fat ugly sister! (continues crying)
ANYA,"Likes 'em fleshy, huh? Bet you wish he'd bloat up a coupla thousand pounds and pop like a big ol' meat zeppelin, don't you?"
CRYING WOMAN,He said he loved me.
ANYA,"Oh, gee, then he must have meant it, 'cause hey, guys never say anything they don't really mean, do they?"
CRYING WOMAN,But we-
ANYA,"They say, ""I love you,"" and, and you think it's true. (crying woman staring at her) They say, ""Oh, Anya, I want to be with you for the rest of my life,"" and, and you believe them, you believe they feel the same way about you, because that's the way love's supposed to be, right?"
CRYING WOMAN,Who's Anya?
ANYA,"And then you get all excited with the tingly anticipation, but wait! Not so fast! There's the apocalypse, a-and the back from the grave, and the blah blah blah blah blah, and by the time you're finally standing there in that beautiful expensive white dress you've dreamed about ever since you became human, he's gets all heebie-jeebie and decides, ""you know, I'd rather just go steady."""
CRYING WOMAN,Men suck. I wish Carl's flesh would-
ANYA,"And you know, he said it isn't me, but how can I believe him? I mean ... he knew he didn't want to get married! Deep down he knew, but he lied to me every day for months!"
CRYING WOMAN,I wish-
ANYA,"He lied and lied and then lied some more, 'cause hey , who's gonna notice with all the other lies flying around like little monkeys? And then he thinks he can just sweep the carnage  underneath the rug by saying , ""oh-"""
Cut to,some sort of underground cavern. A looming shapeless shadow moves across the wall.
VOICE,I'm sorry. Sorry.
ANDREW,"Sorry, please! I'll never try to desecrate your chamber again!"
ANDREW,Just don't hurt me! Please!
JONATHAN,Hit him again! Hit him again!
WARREN,"Wow. These things are tougher than I thought. (as Andrew gets up and joins them) You know, one jolt from this should have dropped an elephant ."
ANDREW,"You want a piece of this? Huh? (zapping the demon repeatedly) Not so tough, are you now, Puff 'N Stuff?!"
WARREN,"Hey, hey! We need him fresh, all right, not smoke house."
ANDREW,(stops zapping)  I'm done being the bait. Next time one of you can wiggle on the hook.
WARREN,If this works ... then next time we'll be the thing that everyone's afraid of.
JONATHAN,"Okay, so ... what now?"
WARREN,"Well, now it's your turn, Sparky."
Cut to,"Spike's crypt, night. Spike holds a glass of blood in one hand and a bottle of liquor in the other. He pours liquor into the blood, puts the bottle down, takes a slow sip."
DAWN,(OS) Does it help?
SPIKE,Doesn't hurt.
SPIKE,"Not planning a camp-out, are we?"
DAWN,"No. I'm sleeping over at Janice's. Figured Willow and Tara might want some time to, uh..."
SPIKE,"(smiles slightly, staring into his glass) Oh, so the birds are flying again, eh? (bitterly) Ain't love grand."
DAWN,"I wanted to stop by on my way and, you know. (beat) Everybody's pretty mad at you."
SPIKE,Yeah. Kinda picked up on that.
DAWN,(softly) You're not going to be coming aroundanymore. Are you?
SPIKE,"(staring into the distance) It's complicated, Nibblet."
DAWN,(small laugh) Everybody's been saying that.
SPIKE,Must be true then. (drinking)
DAWN,Was it worth it? What you did with Anya?
SPIKE,Buffy told you?
DAWN,(shrugs) Kinda caught the show. There was a camera somewhere in the Magic Box. (Spike looking shocked) Warren and Jonathan and that other guy have been watching Buffy.
SPIKE,(sighing angrily) Wankers!
DAWN,(pained) Do you love her?
SPIKE,"Oh, no. No. It was just a ... It was a bad day. For both of us. And we just had a few drinks and, things just-"
DAWN,No. Not Anya. Buffy.
DAWN,(OS) Do you really love her?
DAWN,Then how could you do that to her?
SPIKE,"(still not looking at her) Oh, right , 'cause Big Sis was treating me so well up until that point. (Dawn sighing in exasperation) Must still be a bit of the evil left in me after all."
DAWN,"I don't know what happened betweenyou two. But what you did last night  ... If you wanted to hurt Buffy, congratulations. (quietly) It worked."
Cut to,a different part of the underground tunnel. It's lit with candles. Across the tunnel at one point there's a shimmery magical barrier.
WARREN,This is it. We found it.
ANDREW,You sure it's in there?
WARREN,Careful! Only Nezzla demons can pass through the barrier.
WARREN,Everything else gets curly-fried.
JONATHAN,(OS) This sucks.
WARREN,Just make sure all your skin's covered.
JONATHAN,(whining) Why can't I just use a glamor?
ANDREW,You can't Siegfried and Roy the barrier. It's gotta be the real deal.
JONATHAN,"Ahh! (muffled, disgusted) It's still wet. (The head is also too big and Jonathan's eyes barely show through the eye-holes)"
WARREN,Good. Then it should still be fresh enough.
JONATHAN,"(muffled) Should be? Wait a minute, what do you mean, what do you mean, should be?"
WARREN,"(chuckling, to Andrew) Huh. Wasn't sure that would work."
JONATHAN,"(muttering, muffled) Jackass."
ANDREW,You think he knows?
WARREN,"Well, if he did, why would he be here?"
ANDREW,"Why is he? Our mojo's tight, bro. We could've pulled this ourselves."
WARREN,"Well, somebody had to guinea pig the meat suit. Were, were you gonna volunteer?"
ANDREW,No. (looks nervously toward the barrier) I don't trust the leprechaun.
WARREN,"Okay, just stay frosty. This works the way we planned it, by the end of the evening Jonathan won't be a problem."
WARREN,You got it?
JONATHAN,"(muffled) Yeah, I got it."
ANDREW,That's it?
JONATHAN,(muffled) It better be.
JONATHAN,No way I'm going back through there. Thing stings like a mother.
ANDREW,"Dude, unholy hair gel. (reaching out to touch Jonathan's slimy hair)"
JONATHAN,Get off.
ANDREW,"Make me, skin job."
WARREN,Shut up.
WARREN,Ohh.
WARREN,Gentlemen...
WARREN,...the Orbs of Nezzla'khan. (gazing at them) Strength. Invulnerability. The deluxe package.
ANDREW,They're everything I've ever dreamed of.
JONATHAN,"You know, those things have been down here for like a zillion years. How do we know they still work?"
WARREN,"Ohh, they work."
ANDREW,You don't look any different. I thought they were supposed to make us all huge and veiny. Are you sure they're working right?
WARREN,Let's find out.
JONATHAN,Mahatma!
WARREN,"Welcome to the show, boys."
ANDREW,That was so hot! (Warren nodding)
JONATHAN,Lemme try 'em!
WARREN,"Watch the paws, little man. (lets go)"
JONATHAN,Ow. (cradling his wrist) We're supposed to share.
WARREN,"Oh, relax. All right, you'll each get a whirl. (nodding) As soon as I'm done playing with 'em."
Cut to,"exterior shot of Xander's apartment building, day. Sound of knocking."
BUFFY,Hey.
XANDER,Hey.
XANDER,I think there's still a cold one in the fridge.
BUFFY,"Thanks, but, uh, I think it's still a little early for me."
BUFFY,"(softly) She loves you. You know that. Anya was just ... She was hurting. She was ... hurting and, and she did this really stupid thing."
XANDER,With your boyfriend.
BUFFY,He's not my boyfriend.
XANDER,"I know why Anya ... I understand, I do. (shaking his head) But you..."
XANDER,(still shaking head) All those times I told Spike to get lost ... that he didn't have a chance with a girl like you. (laughs bitterly)
BUFFY,You don't know how hard it's been.
XANDER,"What, lying to me?"
BUFFY,(angrily) Being here. After I was brought back.
BUFFY,You have no idea how hard it is just being here.
XANDER,You could have told me.
BUFFY,You didn't want to know.
XANDER,So you went to him instead?
BUFFY,"Xander, what I do with my personal life is none of your business."
XANDER,(softly) It used to be.
BUFFY,"It just happened, okay?"
XANDER,"(chuckles bitterly) Oh, like, uh, ""Say, you're evil. Get on me""?"
BUFFY,You fought side by side with him when I was gone. You let him take care of Dawn.
XANDER,"But I never forgot what he really is. (Buffy looking hurt) God, what were you thinking?"
BUFFY,"(laughs) You're asking me that? Oh, 'cause your decision making skills have really sparkled lately."
XANDER,"I'm not saying I didn't make any mistakes. But last time I checked, slaughtering half of Europe wasn't one of them. He doesn't have a soul, Buffy. Just some leash they jammed in his head. You think he'd still be all snuggles if that chip ever stopped working? Would you still trust him with Dawn then?"
BUFFY,(resigned) It doesn't matter. I'm not seeing him anymore. It's over.
XANDER,Yeah. There's a lot of that going around.
Fade to,"Sunnydale street, night. People walking around. Sad music. Xander walks down the street looking sad."
Fade to,"Magic shop, night. Anya wanders around dusting things at random."
Cut to,"Willow and Tara's bedroom. The floor and bed are strewn with papers. Willow lies on the bed on her stomach, working on her computer. Tara reclines on the bed propped up by pillows, reading papers. Both are covered by blankets (naked underneath?)."
WILLOW,It's all a mess.
TARA,These things take time. We'll figure it out.
WILLOW,"Sure. We'll decipher codes, foil evil schemes..."
TARA,Finally get out of bed...
WILLOW,I was with you up until there. (Tara laughing) Whoa.
TARA,(sitting up) What is it?
WILLOW,"Uh, one of their data CDs. It's filled with encrypted blueprints, schematics..."
TARA,To what?
WILLOW,I'm not sure. The designations have been stripped.
TARA,Maybe we can cross-reference them with the county clerk's office.
WILLOW,(makes a face) Would that involve getting up?
TARA,(smiling) Eventually.
WILLOW,Then I'm coming out firmly against it.
TARA,(mock-frowning) What about the Trio's evil scheme?
WILLOW,"(grinning) Well, I'm kinda busy working on my own."
WOMAN,You're all wet.
XANDER,It's a good thing I'm part fish. (wiping his hand with the napkin)
WOMAN,(smiling) Which part?
XANDER,The part with the hook in it.
WOMAN,Careful. Someone might reel you in.
XANDER,"Yeah, but then there'd be the flopping and the ... gasping, and ... sure, maybe it'd work out, but chances are I'd up and leave you at the helm in your white dress. Then find you spawning with another fish who turns out to be spawning my very good friend night and day behind my back. (woman looking confused) Then comes the fighting and again with the flopping and the gasping, 'cause hey , Chicken of the Sea here's not doing too good with the women these days."
WOMAN,Huh?
XANDER,"Sorry, I'm just looking to curl up with the quiet alone tonight."
JONATHAN,(irritated) We don't have time for this.
ANDREW,"Ease up, twitchy."
WARREN,All right.
WARREN,Let's make some noise.
Cut to,close on a vampire face. Someone punches him and he grunts.
Cut to wider shot,"the cemetery. Buffy fighting the vamp. He throws a punch which she blocks. Then he spins around, blocks her punch, kicks her in the chest. She does a spin-kick that sends him sprawling."
BUFFY,Not bad. How hard you gonna hit when you're blowin' in the wind?
BUFFY,(pouty) That was rhetorical.
BUFFY,Ow.
Cut to,"exterior shot of the Summers house, night."
SPIKE,(OS) You hurt? You're not moving so well.
BUFFY,"(standing by the sink, not looking at him) Get out."
SPIKE,We have to talk. (closing the door)
BUFFY,(turns to look at him) I really don't.
SPIKE,"Well, this isn't just about you... (pushes the door the rest of the way shut) as much you'd like it to be."
BUFFY,You spoke. I listened. Now leave.
SPIKE,"(softly) I'm sorry. Not that it matters any more, but I needed you to know that."
BUFFY,Why?
SPIKE,Because I care about you.
BUFFY,Then you might want to try the not sleeping with my friends.
SPIKE,I didn't go to Anya for that. I was looking for a spell.
BUFFY,(outraged) You were going to use a spell on me?
SPIKE,"(sighs, exasperated) It wasn't for you! I wanted something . (puts hand on his chest) Anything to make these feelings stop. (angrier) I just wanted it to stop!"
SPIKE,(softly) You should have let him kill me.
BUFFY,(softly) I couldn't do that.
SPIKE,Why?
BUFFY,(moving back toward the tub) You know why.
SPIKE,Because you love me.
BUFFY,(annoyed) No. I don't.
SPIKE,Why do you keep lying to yourself?
BUFFY,(whirls around to face him again) How many times-
BUFFY,(calmer) I have feelings for you. I do. But it's not love. I could never trust you enough for it to be love.
SPIKE,"(laughing) Trust is for old marrieds, Buffy. (Buffy rolling her eyes) Great love is wild ... and passionate and dangerous. It burns and consumes."
BUFFY,Until there's nothing left. Love like that doesn't last.
SPIKE,(pacing) I know you feel like I do. You don't have to hide it anymore.
BUFFY,"(rolling her eyes) Spike, please stop this."
SPIKE,(whispers) Let yourself feel it.
BUFFY,No....
SPIKE,You love me.
BUFFY,"Ow, no, stop it."
BUFFY,"Spike, no - ow - what are you do-"
BUFFY,(yelling) Ow!
SPIKE,Let it go. Let yourself love me.
BUFFY,"(yelling) No, stop it!"
SPIKE,I know you felt it ... when I was inside you...
BUFFY,"No, ow, ow! (sobbing) Please, please, Spike, please..."
SPIKE,"You'll feel it again, Buffy..."
BUFFY,Please don't do this...
SPIKE,I'm gonna make you feel it.
BUFFY,Stop!!!
SPIKE,"Buffy, my god, I didn't-"
BUFFY,(angrily) Because I stopped you. (quieter) Something I should have done a long time ago.
JONATHAN,"(looks around nervously) What are we doing here? Somebody might recognize us. (spotting something, sighing in exasperation) Oh, oh, that's just great."
ANDREW,"Warren's the boss. He's Picard, you're Deanna Troi. Get used to the feeling, Betazoid."
WARREN,"...the clothes, the cars, and the money  ... see, it's all just window dressing."
WARREN,"Baby, this is what's really important. (holding her hand) Two souls, coming together ..."
FRANK,(OS) Hey!
FRANK,"She only comes together with me. So get lost, shrimp. (girlfriend looking amused)"
WARREN,"Frankie? Oh my god, is that you? How long has it been?"
FRANK,(grinning) That was you?
WARREN,"(big fake grin) Yeah, that was me! (quieter) But hey, no hard feelings. I mean, I know you were just fooling around. (Frank nodding)  Like I'm gonna be with your girl in about five minutes."
FRANK,(threateningly) What'd you say?
WARREN,"You heard me, meathead. Take a walk."
FRANK,"Oh, you're dead, you little-"
WARREN,This ain't high school.
GUY,Frankie!
WARREN,"Oh, don't worry about the tab, now, ladies. It's on daddy tonight."
WARREN,"Don't worry, babies. (moves toward the women) Daddy's gonna give you some too."
XANDER,"(walking up) See now, I think it's the daddy thing that's throwing her. (Jonathan hiding his face) 'Cause incest , not that sexy."
JONATHAN,"Aw, crap."
XANDER,"So, uh, why don't we leave the ladies to their impending nausea and move the freakshow outside, whaddaya say?"
WARREN,(nodding) Okay. But lemme ask you something first. (quietly) You think maybe you could put in a word for me with that Anya chick? 'Cause if she's taking it from a vamp ... (smirking) I think I might have a chance .
WARREN,No wonder she's screwing a dead guy. You hit like a girl.
XANDER,"(painfully) Well, at least I know how to get one."
WARREN,Let's see how popular you are without a face.
JONATHAN,"Warren, we have to go."
WARREN,We go when I'm ready.
JONATHAN,"(very nervous) Hey, it's your call, but ... (showing Warren his watch) we're gonna miss that thing you wanted to do tonight (Warren sighing, exasperated) if we don't leave right now. That's all I'm saying."
WARREN,"It's your lucky night, Shemp."
ANDREW,We're just gonna leave him there? What if he sics the Slayer on us?
WARREN,Bring her on.
Cut to,"Summers house, foyer. The door opens and Xander enters, his face still bloody."
XANDER,(calls) Buffy? I found Warren.
XANDER,This what you call not seeing Spike anymore-
XANDER,What did he do?
XANDER,Did he hurt you?
BUFFY,"(sighing, shaking her head) He tried. He didn't..."
XANDER,Son of a bitch. (turns to storm out)
BUFFY,(softly) Don't.
BUFFY,"(tearfully) Please, just ... don't."
WILLOW,"Hey, I think we finally have something-"
WILLOW,What happened?
BUFFY,Nothing.
BUFFY,What'd you find out?
WILLOW,We were able to decipher pretty much everything except these.
TARA,It isn't written in any ancient language we could identify.
XANDER,"(chuckling) It's Klingon. They're love poems. (catching himself, embarrassed) Which has nothing to do with the insidious scheme you're about to describe."
BUFFY,What do you got for me that doesn't rhyme?
TARA,"Um, this. (holding up a CD-ROM)"
WILLOW,It was filled with encoded blueprints and schematics. (handing Buffy a pile of papers)
BUFFY,To what?
TARA,"Um, banks, armored car routes, corporate vaults ... This is big."
WILLOW,They're looking to score some serious dinero. We don't think they're planning just one job.
XANDER,"Spree, anyone?"
BUFFY,"I, I can't cover all of these at once."
WILLOW,You don't have to. We think there's one they may hit tonight.
TARA,It's time sensitive.
XANDER,Be careful. Warren's gone all Mighty Mouse. Emphasis on the might.
BUFFY,Good. Then I won't have to hold back.
SPIKE,I'm gonna make you feel it.
CLEM (OS),Uh ... knock knock?
CLEM,"I was just in the neighborhood so I thought, you know..."
CLEM,"...there's a Nightrider marathon on the TV, so, uh... (holding up bucket) I got hot wings!"
SPIKE,(shakily) What have I done?
SPIKE,"Why *didn't* I do it? (looks up at the ceiling, sighs) What has she done to me?"
CLEM,"She done who? (Spike waves his hand dismissively) Ohh. The Slayer, huh? Gosh. (shaking head) She break up with you again?"
SPIKE,We were never together. Not really. She'd never lower herself that far.
CLEM,"She's a sweet girl, Spike, but hey. Whew. Issues. (Spike giving a sarcastic grin) And no wonder, with the whole coming back from the grave and whatnot. Hey, I had this cousin, who got resurrected by some kooky shaman... (chuckles) Whoo-boy! Was that a mess."
SPIKE,(desperate) Why do I feel this way?
CLEM,(shrugs) Love's a funny thing.
SPIKE,Is that what this is? (Clem looking uncertain) I can feel it. Squirming in my head. (puts hand to his head)
CLEM,Love?
SPIKE,The chip. Gnawing bits and chunks.
CLEM,Uhh ... maybe a wet cloth?
SPIKE,"You know, everything used to be so clear. Slayer. Vampire. Vampire kills Slayer, sucks her dry, picks his teeth with her bones. It's always been that way. I've tasted the life of two Slayers. But with Buffy... (grimacing in anguish) It isn't supposed to be this way!"
SPIKE,(angrily) It's the chip! Steel and wires and silicon. (sighs) It won't let me be a monster. (quietly) And I can't be a man. I'm nothing.
CLEM,"Hey. Come on now, Mr. Negative. You never know what's just around the corner. Things change."
SPIKE,"Yeah, they do."
SPIKE,If you make them.
Cut to,"an amusement park, shut down for the night. A banner reads ""Opening Weekend!"" Pan across closed concession stands, to a large stone gate with lettering over the archway reading ""WILD RIVER ADVENTURE."""
GUARD #1,"All right, that's the last one."
SUIT,Always the biggest gate of the year.
GUARD #1,Yeah.
SUIT,Don't lose any.
GUARD #1,Yeah.
GUARD #2,Wanna grab a bite after? (Guard #1 nodding) I think Ruby's is still open.
GUARD #2,What the hell?
GUARD #1,There's something back there!
ANDREW,"Man, I can't wait to get my hands on his orbs."
JONATHAN,"(sarcastic) Yeah, I'm sure he'll be giving 'em up any second now."
BUFFY,(OS) Hey.
BUFFY,Is this your bank?
BUFFY,"'Cause if not, there's gonna be a fee for that."
WARREN,(striding toward her) I was wondering when Super Bitch would show up.
BUFFY,"You really got a problem with strong women, don't you?"
WARREN,Nothing I can't handle.
BUFFY,(gets up) It's getting better.
WARREN,That all you got?
ANDREW,(screams) No!
BUFFY,There's two ways this can end. And right now? I'm thinking they're both gonna hurt.
ANDREW,I think you're right.
WARREN,What's the matter baby? You never fight a real man before?
WARREN,"Wow. That almost hurt, kitten."
ANDREW,Kill her! Kill her!
WARREN,"You know who I am? Huh, Slayer?"
BUFFY,You're a murderer. (getting up)
WARREN,"Well, that too, but more to the point-"
WARREN,"And it's not the muscles, baby."
WARREN,It's the brains.
BUFFY,I'll remember that when I knock 'em clean out of your-
WARREN,"(amused) Whoa! Sparky, I didn't think you had it in you."
JONATHAN,(quietly to Buffy) The orbs! Smash his orbs.
WARREN,"Say good night, bitch."
BUFFY,"Good night, bitch."
BUFFY,"(advancing) You're nothing but a sad little boy, Warren. But it's time you grow up, and pay for what you've done."
WARREN,(panting) Get away from me!
BUFFY,"(sighing, almost whining) Oh, come *on.*"
ANDREW,"Well played, Slayer!"
JONATHAN,(whines) Why didn't I get one of those?!
ANDREW,(to Buffy) This round to you. But the game is far from over.
Cut to,"exterior police station. A car with its siren wailing and lights flashing pulls up and stops. The driver and his partner get out, open the rear doors and take out Andrew and Jonathan, both handcuffed. The cops begin leading them inside."
JONATHAN,(furious) Jet packs. You jerks were setting me up to take the fall.
ANDREW,(upset) He left me. He flew away and left me.
JONATHAN,Oh god. The Big House.
AUDREW,"(crying) How could he do this to me? He promised we'd be together, but ... he was just using me. He never really loved- (catching himself) ...hanging out with us."
ANDREW,"You think he'll come back for us? I mean ... he wouldn't just take off, would he?"
Cut to,"a highway somewhere, night. The lights of Sunnydale are visible in the distance. Spike rides up on his motorcycle, cigarette in his mouth. He stops and looks over at the city."
SPIKE,"Get nice and comfy, Slayer. I'll be back. And when I do ... things are gonna change."
Cut to,"exterior shot of the Summers house, day."
WILLOW,Hey. Clothes.
TARA,Better not get used to 'em.
WILLOW,"Hmm, yes ma'am."
TARA,Mmmm... Xander!
WILLOW,"(pulling out of the hug) Okay, not quite the response I was fishing for."
TARA,"No, he's here."
WILLOW,(opening a dresser drawer) Think they're making up?
TARA,"(turning from the window, smiling at her) I hope so, that's the best part."
XANDER,Time for the Spring Poking already?
BUFFY,(turns to see him) Just making sure there are no more Evil Trio cameras. Or Evil Uno.
XANDER,The sinister yet addictive card game?
BUFFY,"Warren. Jonathan and Andrew got clinked, but ... Warren pulled a Rocket Man."
XANDER,You'll find him. He won't be much good without his friends.
BUFFY,"(softly) No, he won't."
XANDER,How did we get here?
BUFFY,Scenic route. Long drive.
XANDER,The past few weeks...
BUFFY,I know.
XANDER,"I thought I hit bottom, but ... it hurt. That you didn't trust me enough to tell me about Spike. (pauses, softly) It hurt."
BUFFY,I'm sorry. I should have told you.
XANDER,"(small smile) Maybe you would have, if I hadn't given you so many reasons to think I'd be an ass about it."
BUFFY,Guess we've all done a lot of things lately we're not proud of.
XANDER,(slightly larger smile) I think I've got you beat.
BUFFY,Wanna compare?
XANDER,Not so much.
BUFFY,(teary) Let's not find out.
XANDER,Buffy!
WARREN,You think you can just do that to me? You think I'd let you get away with that? (laughs crazily) Think again.
TARA,(frowning) Your shirt.
WILLOW,"(shocked, rushing forward) Tara?"
XANDER,Sweet fancy Moses! Where the hell did he-
XANDER,Oh god!
WILLOW,(desperate) Tara?! Baby?
WILLOW,"(sobbing) Baby, come on! Get up!"
XANDER,(desperate) Oh god. Buffy? Buffy! Buffy!
WILLOW,No... no.... (crying)
