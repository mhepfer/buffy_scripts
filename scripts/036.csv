Buffy,Mom?
Joyce,Oh!  Buffy.
Joyce,Um . . .
Buffy,Sorry.
Joyce,"No, no.  Don't worry about it.  I-I guess I just got used to all  the quiet while you were gone. (smiles) But it's no problem."
Joyce,"Uh, look! (hangs the mask on its hook) It's, uh, Nigerian.  (faces Buffy again) We got a very exciting shipment in at the Gallery.  (glances around the room) I, um, thought I'd hang a few pieces in here.  It cheers up the room."
Buffy,"(looking at the mask) It's angry at the room, Mom. It wants the  room to suffer."
Joyce,(nods) You have no appreciation of primitive art. (sees that  Buffy is holding a sweater) You going out?
Buffy,"(looks down at the sweater) Oh. Um . . . well, i-if it's okay. I,  um . . . I'd like to find Willow and Xander."
Joyce,Will you be slaying?
Buffy,Only if they give me lip. (smiles weakly)
Joyce,"Uh, can I make you a sandwich or something before you go?  You  must be starving."
Buffy,I was un-until that four-course snack you served me after  dinner.
Joyce,"Well, then, um . . . (goes to her dresser) You know, w-why don't I  drive you? (grabs her keys) Uh, I mean, they could be anywhere."
Buffy,"Mom . . . if you don't want me to go, just say so."
Joyce,"No, no. (looks down at her keys briefly) I-I just want to put  this whole thing behind us, get back to normal. (inhales deeply) You go.  Have a good time."
Buffy,Okay.
Buffy,(lowers the stake) Didn't anyone ever warn you about playing  with pointy sticks? (shakes it at him) It's all fun and games until  somebody loses an eye.
Xander,You shouldn't sneak up on people like that!
Xander,"Jeez, Buff!"
Cordelia,"Come in, Nighthawk!  Everything okay?"
Buffy,(taken aback) Nighthawk?
Buffy,Ooh!
Cordelia,"(recognizes) Oh, hey, Buffy."
Buffy,"Hey, guys."
Buffy,"You know, I--maybe it's too late.  Maybe we should just come back  tomorrow."
Buffy,What if he's mad?
Xander,Mad? Just because you ran away and abandoned your post and your  friends and your mom and made him lay awake every night worrying about  you? (to Oz and Willow) Maybe we should wait out here.
Xander,"(to Giles) Check it out.  The Watcher is back on the clock.  (Giles slips on his glasses) And just when you were thinking career  change, maybe becoming a . . . a looker or a . . . a seer."
Giles,"Thank you, Xander."
Giles,"Welcome home, Buffy."
Buffy,"I got in a few hours ago, but I wanted to go see my mom first."
Giles,"Yes.  Yes, of course.  How, how did you find her?"
Buffy,"Well, I pretty much remembered the address."
Giles,"Ah, eh, I mean, uh . . ."
Giles,How are things between you? (notices the whistling) Ah.  Excuse  me. (goes into the kitchen)
Oz,"Hey, so you're not wanted for murder anymore."
Buffy,Good.  That was such a drag.
Xander,So where were you?  Did you go to Belgium?
Buffy,(gives him an odd look) Why would I go to Belgium?
Xander,I think the relevant question is why wouldn't you? (smiles  hugely and giggles) Belgium!
Buffy,"What about you, Xander?  What's up with you?"
Xander,"Oh, you know, same old, same old."
Cordelia,Hardly.
Xander,"Okay, I lied, a whole lot is new."
Buffy,"Well, that's good, isn't it?  New is good."
Xander,"Oh, yeah, absolutely, except for the obvious.  It's not too  much . . . (inaudible)"
Cordelia,"Yeah, 'cause you weren't at the hotel."
Xander,Cordelia's parents dragged her onto a luxury vacation.
Buffy,I feel for you.
Giles,Here we are then. (sets the tray on the coffee table) Cheer us  up.
Cordelia,"So were you, like, living in a box, or what?"
Buffy,"Well, it's a long story."
Xander,So skip the heartwarming stuff about kindly old people and  saving the farm and get right to the dirt.
Giles,(pours several cups) Perhaps Buffy could use a little time to  adjust before we grill her on her summer activities.
Buffy,What he said.
Xander,"Fair enough.  In fact, you can leave the slaying to us while you  settle in.  We got you covered."
Buffy,"I noticed.  You guys seem down with the slayage, all tricked out  with your walkies and everything."
Cordelia,"Yeah, but the outfits suck.  This whole Rambo thing is so  over.  I'm thinking more sporty, like Hilfiger maybe."
Willow,"Still, we were getting good.  We dusted (nods) nine out of ten."
Oz,(whispers to Willow) Six out of ten.
Willow,Six out of ten.
Xander,"Whatever, we were kicking a little undead booty."
Buffy,"Well, thank you for the offer, but I think I just wanna get back  to my normal routine.  You know, school, slaying . . . kid's stuff.  In fact,  I'm jonesing for a little brainless fun. (to Xander) What are you doing  tomorrow?"
Xander,"Oh, I would, but, uh, (reaches his hands around Cordelia's arm)  I'm kind of tied up. (smiles)"
Cordelia,You wish. (pushes him away)
Buffy,(to Willow) Will?
Willow,"Um, tomorrow I--"
Buffy,"Oh, come on. Friends don't let friends browse alone."
Willow,"Okay. I had some schoolwork, but . . . I can change my plans."
Giles,"(raises his cup) As for school, Buffy, uh, you know you'll have  to talk to Principal Snyder before--"
Buffy,On it. Mom is making an appointment with His Ugliness.  I know  she can break him.
Snyder,Absolutely not.  Under no circumstances.
Joyce,But you can't keep her out of school.  You don't have the right.
Snyder,"I have not only the right, but also a nearly physical sensation  of pleasure at the thought of keeping her out of school.  I'd describe  myself as tingly."
Joyce,Buffy was cleared of all those charges.
Snyder,"Yes.  And while she may live up to the not-a-murderer  requirement for enrollment, she is a troublemaker, destructive to school  property and the occasional student.  And her grade point average is  enough to . . . (his eyes glaze over for an instant) I'm sorry.  Another  tingle moment. (smiles smugly)"
Joyce,(with controlled anger in her voice) I don't see how you can be  so cavalier about a young girl's entire future!
Snyder,"I'm quite sure that a girl with the talents and abilities of  Buffy will land on her feet.  In fact, (leans toward Buffy) I noticed as  I came in this morning that Hot Dog on a Stick is hiring. (Buffy gives  him an angry stare) You will look so cute in that hat."
Buffy,"Let's go, Mom."
Joyce,"This isn't over.  If I have to, I'll go all the way to the Mayor.  (follows Buffy out)"
Snyder,Wouldn't that be interesting.
Joyce,"Don't worry about school, honey.  If we can't get you back into  Sunnydale, maybe we can swing private school."
Buffy,"Private school?  You mean, like jackets and kilts?  You want me to  get field hockey knees?"
Joyce,(smiles) It's not that bad.
Buffy,"What about home schooling?  You know, it's not just for scary  religious people anymore."
Joyce,We'll work something out.  Okay?
Joyce,Say hi to Willow?
Pat,"Oh, my word!  Oh, you must be Buffy! (steps down from the porch)  Look at you.  Aren't you a picture?"
Buffy,(unsure) Thank you.
Pat,"Oh, I'm Pat, (offers her hand) from your mom's book club. (they  shake hands) I'm sure she mentioned me."
Buffy,Actually--
Pat,"I, um, I sort of took it upon myself to look after her while you  were, (rolls her eyes) you know, off and away or what have you, and . . ."
Pat,"(inhales) Well, between, uh, (exhales) your situation and reading  'Deep End of the Ocean', she was, uh, she was just a wreck. You can  imagine."
Pat,"Anyway, I'm off.  We're-we're making empanadas in my Spanish class  tonight. (giggles) You go be with your mom.  You two need to rebond."
Buffy,Pat wishes us quality time. (goes to the cupboard)
Joyce,Oh. I met her in a--
Buffy,Book club. (gets out a glass)
Joyce,Yeah.
Buffy,Got it.
Joyce,"(looks up) Oh, uh, before I forget, uh, Willow just called."
Buffy,(suddenly attentive) Where was she?
Joyce,"Uh, she, she got held up, but she said she tried to call."
Buffy,(confused) Was there a message?
Joyce,No.  But I had a thought.  What if I invited Willow and Mr. Giles  and everybody over for dinner tomorrow night? (smiles) Don't you think  that would be nice?
Joyce,"Since I sort of already did, I was hoping for a yes."
Buffy,It'll be fun. (loses her smile)
Joyce,"Great.  Uh, do me a favor?  Run down and get the company plates."
Buffy,"Mom, Willow and everybody aren't company-plate people.  They're  normal-plate people."
Joyce,We never have guests for dinner.  Indulge your mother?
Buffy,Oh!
Buffy,Eww.
Buffy,"Next time, I get to pick the mother-daughter bonding activity."
Joyce,Do you wanna say something?
Buffy,Like what?  Thanks for stopping by and dying?
Joyce,"How about, um . . . good-bye, stray cat, who lost its way.  We hope  you find it."
Buffy,I thought they'd be here.
Angel,They are.  They're waiting for you.
Buffy,(looks at him) Am I dreaming?
Angel,(smiles and chuckles) I'm probably the wrong person to ask.  (Buffy looks ahead again) You'd better go.
Buffy,(looks at him) I'm afraid.
Angel,(shrugs and looks at her) You should be.
Joyce,"I've been on the phone with the, uh, Superintendent of Schools.  At least he seems more reasonable than that nasty little horrid, bigoted,  rodent-man."
Buffy,Mom . . .
Joyce,"Anyway, um, I'm going in to speak with him this afternoon.  Uh,  as for private schools, uh, Miss Porter's accepts late admissions."
Joyce,"I, uh, I wrote the information down for you."
Buffy,"A girls' school? (goes to the island to read the slip of paper)  So now it's jackets, kilts, and no boys? (looks back at her mom) Care to  throw in a little foot-binding?"
Joyce,"Buffy, you made some bad choices.  You just might have to live  with some consequences."
Joyce,"Nothing's settled yet. (looks for something to do and spies the  trash) I just wish you didn't have to be so secretive about things.  (ties off the trashbag) I mean, it's not your fault you have a special  circumstance.  They should make allowances for you."
Buffy,"Mom, I'm a slayer.  It's not like I need to ride a little bus to  school."
Joyce,"(walks to the door with the trash) Couldn't you just tell a few  people, like Principal Snyder . . . and maybe the police?"
Joyce,"I mean, I would think they would be happy to have a . . . a  superhero."
Joyce,"Is that the right term?  I mean, it's not offensive, is it?"
Buffy,Welcome to the Hellmouth Petting Zoo.
Giles,"Oh, my God, what a stench!"
Buffy,"You know, I wanted Forest Pine or April Fresh, but Mom wanted  Dead Cat."
Giles,"I'll, uh . . ."
Giles,"Ugh!  I'll get it back to the library, see if we can determine  its exact origins."
Giles,"It's, uh . . . striking and . . . Nigerian."
Joyce,"Oh. Yes. I-I-I have this wonderful dealer who specializes in  ancient artifacts, I don't know if you--"
Buffy,"(interrupts) You know, I love art talk as much as the next very  dull person, but we have work to do, Giles.  Research mode. (heads for  the door)"
Giles,"Sh-sh-shouldn't you stay with your mother, perhaps, Buffy?  I  mean, you must have--"
Joyce,"Please, no.  I, it's fine. She can go with you."
Giles,"A-actually, she can't.  Um . . . (to Buffy) you're not allowed on  school property."
Buffy,Oh. (smiles ironically)
Giles,"I'm sorry. Um, uh . . . I'll, I'll call as, as soon as I know  something."
Joyce,"Oh, we'll see you tonight?"
Giles,"Tonight, then.  Yes."
Oz,It looks dead.  It smells dead. (Xander nods in agreement) Yet it's  movin' around.  That's interesting.
Cordelia,"Nice pet, Giles.  Don't you like anything regular?  Golf, USA  Today, or anything? (sits opposite Willow to help research)"
Giles,(comes down from the stacks) I'm trying to find out how and why  it rose from the grave.  It's not as if I'm going to take it home and  offer it a saucer of warm milk.
Oz,"Well, I like it.  I think you should call it Patches."
Willow,What about Buffy's welcome home dinner tonight?  I had told her  mom we'd help out.  Bring stuff.
Cordelia,I'm the dip.
Xander,"Uh, you gotta admire the purity of it. (chuckles)"
Cordelia,"(looks up at everyone) What?  Onion dip.  Stirring, *not*  cooking.  It's what I bring."
Oz,"(leans back in his chair) We should figure out what kinda deal this  is.  I mean, is it a-a gathering, a shindig or a hootenanny?"
Cordelia,What's the difference?
Oz,"Well, a gathering is brie, mellow song stylings; shindig, (nods to  Cordelia) dip, (Cordelia smiles) less mellow song stylings, perhaps a  large amount of malt beverage; and hootenanny, well, it's chock full of  hoot, just a little bit of nanny."
Xander,"Well, I hate brie."
Cordelia,I know.  It smells like Giles's cat.
Giles,It's not my--
Xander,"(interrupts) And what'll we talk about at a gathering anyway?  'So, Buffy, did you meet any nice pimps on your travels?  And oh, by the  by, thanks for ruining our lives for the past three months.'"
Willow,Xander . . .
Xander,"You know what I mean.  She doesn't want to talk about it, we  don't want to talk about it, so why don't we just shut up and dance?"
Willow,"Well, Buffy said she did want to loosen up, you know, have some  kid time. (to Oz) Aren't you guys rehearsing tonight?  Why don't you play  at the party?"
Oz,"Yeah, I think I could supply some Dingo action."
Giles,"Uh, I-I'm not sure that, a, a, um . . . shindig . . ."
Oz,Hootenanny.
Giles,"H-hootenanny i-i-is really the order of the day.  Uh, uh, it  should . . . maybe something a little more intimate.  I-I-I mean, Buffy has  just got home.  I'm, I'm sure she's still feeling a little disoriented."
Willow,"All the more reason to make her feel welcome, a-and a big party  says, 'Welcome, Buffy.'"
Xander,"Okay, so one vote from the Old Guy for a Smelly Cheese Night,  and how many votes for actual fun, huh?"
Giles,"Alright, alright.  Have it your way.  I'm just glad to have her  home."
Giles,Now things can get back to normal.
Pat,"Hey, there you are! (comes in) Not thinking about any more flights  of fancy, I hope."
Pat,"Joyce said there was room for one more, so I said forget facial  night and let's party! (smiles) I bet you like empanadas."
Buffy,Do you want to see my mom?
Pat,Please.
Buffy,(whining loudly and frantically) MOM!
Joyce,"Oh, Pat!  Good.  Buffy, I hope you don't mind."
Pat,Hi!  You look great!
Devon,"Hey, Buffy.  So where do you want the band to set up?"
Buffy,Wh-the band?
Buffy,Hey!
Willow,(smiling) Hey! (listens to the band)
Lyrics,<I>You can send me a savior</I>
Buffy,This is large!
Willow,(looks at Buffy) You like?
Lyrics,<I>That lives till the end of time</I>
Buffy,Yeah.  It's great. (looks back at the band) I-I was just sort of  hoping it would be . . . us.
Lyrics,<I>Time</I>
Willow,Sorry.  What? (indicates that it's too loud to hear)
Lyrics,<I>The promise of heaven</I>
Buffy,"(louder) This is amazing, but I was sort of hoping we could just  hang together, the gang."
Lyrics,<I>But that only leaves me dry</I>
Lyrics,<I>Dry</I>
Lyrics,<I>Too many saviors / And I won't die</I>
Lyrics,"<I>I never cried, but I needed more from you</I>"
Lyrics,<I>I found my life without you now</I>
Lyrics,<I>And I never mind / I'm only half as blind</I>
Buffy,Is everything okay?
Lyrics,<I>Cause I needed more from you</I>
Buffy,"You . . . You seem to be avoiding me, i-in the one-on-one sense."
Willow,(looks surprised) What?
Lyrics,<I>And I never mind</I>
Willow,"This isn't avoiding.  See?  Here you are, here I am."
Lyrics,<I>I'm only half as blind</I>
Buffy,So we're cool?
Lyrics,<I>Cause I needed more from you</I>
Willow,"Way! That's why, with the party, 'cause we're all glad you're  back."
Buffy,Okay.
Willow,Okay.  Good.
Lyrics,<I>You say my reflection never fades from your eyes</I>
Lyrics,<I>I got another rope over me / But I won't hang / I can feel you  covet my faith</I>
Lyrics,<I>I said another lie / I know why / I don't wanna sway</I>
Xander,"Hey, Buff, uh . . . what are you doing?"
Buffy,I was just taking a break from all this wacky fun.
Lyrics,<I>I don't wanna sway</I>
Xander,"Some kind of party, huh?  I guess a lot of people are glad to  have you back."
Buffy,It seems like people I didn't even know missed me.
Buffy,Did Giles say he was going to be late?
Lyrics,<I>Seize these worlds / Or never live again</I>
Xander,"Uh, he was Library Man last time I saw him.  But he'll be here.  He wants to celebrate your homecoming.  We all do.  I mean, it's great to  have the Buffster back. (smiles)"
Lyrics,<I>Seize these worlds</I>
Xander,(tries to get Cordelia's attention) Isn't it?
Cordelia,(smiles) Totally! (nods)
Lyrics,<I>Or never live again</I>
Cordelia,(to Xander) Except you were kinda turning me on with that  whole Boy Slayer look.
Xander,Was I now?
Cordelia,"You bet, Nighthawk."
Buffy,"Well, I'll just be, uh . . . (gives up) oh, yeah. (leaves)"
Doctor,Breathe.  Breathe.
Doctor,"Alright, look.  These burns are too extensive.  It's 7:43.  Let's  call it."
Nurse,"Oh, my God!"
Lyrics,<I>You know I roll it over in my head</I>
Lyrics,<I>I won't feel you covet my faith</I>
Lyrics,<I>You've said another lie / I know why</I>
Stoner,This party?  Heard it was for some chick that just got out of  rehab. (takes a drag from his joint)
Lyrics,<I>I don't wanna sway</I>
Lyrics,<I>I don't wanna sway</I>
Joyce,Whew!
Lyrics,<I>Seize these worlds</I>
Pat,"Now, how you holding up, Joyce, hmm?  Really."
Lyrics,<I>Or never live again</I>
Joyce,Really?  I'm . . . I don't know.
Lyrics,<I>Seize these worlds</I>
Joyce,"While Buffy was gone, all I could think about was getting her  home."
Lyrics,<I>Or never live again</I>
Joyce,"I just knew that if I could put my arms around her and tell her  how much I loved her, everything would be okay."
Lyrics,<I>Seize these worlds</I>
Pat,But?
Lyrics,<I>Or never live again</I>
Joyce,"Having Buffy home, I-I thought it was gonna make it all better,  but in some ways, it's almost worse."
Lyrics,<I>Seize these worlds / Or never live again</I>
Giles,"Oh, Lord!"
Stoner,"Party Villa, can I rock you?"
Giles,"(cut to him) I-I-I need to speak with Buffy.  Um, immediately!    I have some information that is extremely important."
Lyrics,<I>Feeling I've been lost for years</I>
Lyrics,<I>You can never understand me</I>
Stoner,Yeah!  Fiesta foul!  You gotta do a shot!
Lyrics,<I>Unless you've seen those tears</I>
Giles,(cut to him) I need to speak to Buffy!  Now!
Stoner,(cut to him) Bunny?
Lyrics,<I>But you never get to sleep</I>
Stoner,"(to his friend, pointing) See?  That guy's gotta do a shot."
Lyrics,<I>When I'm away</I>
Giles,Buffy!
Stoner,(holds the phone out to the crowd) Hey!  I need to talk to a  Buddy!
Lyrics,<I>I don't mind</I>
Stoner,(to the room) Is there a Buddy here?
Lyrics,<I>The deeper that you lay</I>
Stoner,"(into the phone) Sorry.  He's not here.  You got the wrong casa,  Mr. Belvedere. (hangs up)"
Lyrics,"<I>Out of time / Pain, I can't sleep</I>"
Giles,(cut to him) H-hello?  Hello?
Willow,You're leaving again?
Willow,"(upset) What, you just stopped by for your lint brush and now  you're ready to go?"
Buffy,It's not like anyone will mind.
Willow,"(heavy with sarcasm) Oh, no.  Have a great time.  Oh, oh, and  don't forget to *not* write."
Buffy,"(faces Willow, sobbing) Why are you attacking me?  I'm trying."
Willow,"Wow, and it looks so much like giving up!"
Buffy,I'm just trying to make things easier.
Willow,For who?
Buffy,You guys were doing just fine without me.
Willow,We were doing the best we could!  It's not like we had a lot of  choice in the matter.
Buffy,"Sorry that I had to leave, but you don't know what I was going  through."
Willow,"Well, I'd like to."
Buffy,You wouldn't understand.
Willow,"(considers) Well, maybe I don't need to understand.  Maybe I . . .  I just need you to talk to me."
Buffy,How could I talk to you when you were avoiding me?
Willow,"This isn't easy, Buffy!  I know you're going through stuff,  but . . . so am I."
Buffy,"I know that you were worried about me, but--"
Willow,"No!  I don't just mean that. I mean, my life!  You know?  I, um . . .  I'm having all sorts of--I'm dating, I'm having serious dating with a  *werewolf*, a-and I'm studying witchcraft and killing vampires, and I  didn't have anyone (starts sobbing) to talk to about all this scary life  stuff.  And you were my best friend."
Giles,Unbelievable. (mocks Joyce) 'Do you like my mask?  Isn't it  pretty?  It raises the *dead*!' Americans.
Giles,Jesus!
Giles,My God.
Giles,Are you alright?
Giles,Are you hurt?
Giles,Good God.
Buffy,You have no idea how much I missed you.  Everyone.  I wanted to  call every day.
Willow,"That doesn't matter, Buffy.  It doesn't make it okay that you  didn't."
Joyce,What is this?  Is this some sort of a joke?
Buffy,"Mom, please, could you, could you just--"
Joyce,"(interrupts) No, I can't just!  Buffy, what is this?"
Willow,She was running away again.
Buffy,"No, I wasn't. (pauses, very confused) I'm not sure."
Joyce,"Well, you better *get* sure and explain yourself right away!  If you think you can just-just take off any time you feel like it--"
Buffy,Stop it!  Please!  I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing.
Joyce,"Don't you leave this house, young lady!"
Joyce,You know what?  That's it.
Joyce,You and I are going to have a talk.
Buffy,"(implores) Mom, please--"
Joyce,"(interrupts, mad) You know what?  I don't care.  I don't care what  your friends think of me, or you for that matter, because you put me  through the wringer, Buffy. (inhales) I mean it. (exhales and inhales)  And I've had schnapps. (exhales) Do you have *any* idea what it's been  like?"
Buffy,"Mom, this isn't the time--"
Joyce,"(interrupts again) You can't imagine *months* of not knowing.  Not knowing whether you're lying dead in a ditch somewhere or, I don't  know, living it up--"
Buffy,"(interrupts in turn) But you told me!  You're the one who said I  should go.  You said if I leave this house, don't come back.  You found  out who I really was, and you couldn't deal.  Don't you remember?"
Joyce,"Buffy, you didn't give me time.  You just dumped this thing on me  and you expected me to get it.  Well, guess what?  Mom's not perfect,  okay?  I handled it badly.  But that doesn't give you the right to punish  me by running away."
Buffy,Punish you?  I didn't do this to punish you!
Xander,"Well, you did.  You should've seen what you put her through."
Buffy,Great.  Thanks.  Anybody else want to weigh in here? (sees  Jonathon) How about you by the dip?
Jonathon,"No, thanks.  I'm good."
Xander,"You know, maybe you don't want to hear it, Buffy, but taking  off like you did was incredibly selfish and stupid."
Buffy,"Okay!  Okay.  I screwed up.  I know this.  But you have no idea!    You have, you have no idea what happened to me or what I was feeling!"
Xander,Did you even try talking to anybody?
Buffy,There was nothing that anybody could do.  Okay?  I just had to  deal with this on my own.
Xander,"Yeah, and you see how well *that* one worked out.  You can't  just bury stuff, Buffy.  It'll come right back up to get you."
Giles,"Oh, good show, Giles."
Giles,Like riding a bloody bicycle!
Buffy,"As if I even could've gone to you, Xander.  You made your  feelings about Angel and I perfectly clear."
Xander,"Look.  I'm sorry that your honey was a demon, but most girls  don't hop a Greyhound over boy troubles."
Cordelia,"Time out, Xander.  Put yourself in Buffy's shoes for just a  minute.  Okay?  I'm Buffy, freak of nature, right?  Naturally I pick a  freak for a boyfriend, and then he turns into Mr. Killing Spree, which  is pretty much my fault--"
Buffy,(interrupts) Cordy!  Get outta my shoes!
Cordelia,"I'm just trying to help, Buffy."
Willow,"Buffy, you never--"
Buffy,"(nears the breaking point) Willow, please. I can't take this  from you, too."
Xander,Let her finish!  You at least owe her that.
Buffy,"God, Xander!  Do you think you could at least stick to annoying  me on your own behalf?"
Xander,"Fine!  You stop acting like an idiot, I'll stop annoying you!"
Buffy,"(steps up to Xander) Oh, you wanna talk acting like an idiot,  Nighthawk?"
Oz,"Okay. I'm gonna step in now, (gets between them) being Referee Guy."
Willow,"No, let them go, Oz. (gets a look from him) Talking about it  isn't helping.  We might as well try some violence."
Willow,I was being sarcastic!
Buffy,"Xander, kitchen!"
Xander,I got your back!
Joyce,Are these vampires?
Buffy,"Uh, I don't think so."
Willow,"Buffy, heads up!"
Buffy,"No, not vampires."
Xander,"Man, this sucker wobbles, but he won't fall down!"
Buffy,We got to get 'em back outside!
Joyce,On three!
Joyce,One . . . Two . . . Three!
Buffy,Okay! We're gonna have to barricade this door!
Buffy,We need some help out here!
Xander,I got him.  Go help Buffy.
Oz,Grab that table!
Buffy,Upstairs!
Joyce,"Oh, Pat!"
Joyce,"Oh, God . . ."
Buffy,Careful!
Pat,Oh . . .
Xander,"(watches the stairs) Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry."
Joyce,(to Pat) I got you. Okay.
Cordelia,Oz!
Oz,GO! GO!
Willow,She's--
Joyce,"Oh, God! Pat! She's dead!"
Joyce,What do we do if they get in?
Xander,I kind of think we die.
Cordelia,I don't hear anything.  Should we check?
Oz,(exhales) Let's go for it.
Cordelia,Here.
Oz,Thanks.
Giles,"Cordelia, it's me! It's me!"
Cordelia,How do we know it's really you and not zombie Giles?
Giles,"Cordelia, do stop being tiresome."
Cordelia,It's him.
Oz,I think the Dead Man's Party's moved upstairs.
Giles,That makes sense.  It's the mask in Joyce's bedroom they're  after.
Cordelia,Mask?
Giles,"The mask holds the power of a . . . zombie demon, called Ovu  Mobani--Evil Eye. I don't think we can get past them."
Oz,"Well, what happens if they get the mask?"
Giles,"If one of them puts it on, they become the demon incarnate."
Cordelia,Worse than a zombie.
Giles,"Yes, worse."
Joyce,"Oh, God! We thought you were--"
Xander,"(to Joyce) Generally speaking, when scary things get scared:  not good."
Mobani,"I live, you die."
Buffy,"Willow, don't look!"
Giles,Out back!
Buffy,Not looking.
Buffy,Not looking!
Giles,Tell Buffy Mobani's power lies in his eyes!
Giles,She has to go for the eyes to defeat him!
Oz,Buffy!
Buffy,"Hey, Pat!"
Buffy,Made you look.
Oz,Never mind.
Joyce,Honey!
Joyce,Oh!
Joyce,Are you all right?
Buffy,Yeah.
Joyce,"(panting) So, is this a typical day at the office?"
Buffy,No.  This was nothing.
Xander,(to Buffy) Nice moves.
Buffy,"You, too."
Snyder,Do we have an appointment?
Giles,I'd like to have a word with you.
Snyder,"If that word is Buffy, then I have two words for you: 'good'  and 'riddance'.  Now, if you don't mind, I have an appointment with the  Mayor."
Giles,You can't keep her out of this school.
Snyder,(pulls on his jacket) I think you'll find I can.
Giles,You had no grounds for expelling her.
Snyder,"I have grounds, I have precedent, and a tingly kind of feeling."
Giles,"Buffy Summers is a minor, and is entitled to a public education.  Your personal dislike of the girl does not legally entitle you to--"
Snyder,(interrupts) Why don't you take it up with the city council?
Giles,I thought I'd start with the State Supreme Court.
Giles,"You're powerful in local circles, but I believe I can make life  very difficult for you, professionally speaking. (confidently) And Buffy  will be allowed back in."
Snyder,Sorry.  I'm not convinced.
Giles,(grining) Would you like me to convince you?
Willow,"I mean, I'm not a full-fledged witch. That takes years.  I just  did a couple pagan blessings and . . . a teeny glamour to hide a zit."
Buffy,Does it scare you?
Willow,"It has.  I tried to communicate with the spirit world, and I  *so* wasn't ready for that.  It's like being pulled apart inside.  Plus I  blew the power for our whole block.  Big scare."
Buffy,I wish I could've been there with you.
Willow,"Me, too.  I really freaked out."
Buffy,I am sorry.
Willow,"It's okay.  I understand you having to bail.  I can forgive that.  Mm, I have to make allowances for what you're going through a-and be a  grownup about it. (gives Buffy a slightly smug look)"
Buffy,"(smiles) You're really enjoying this whole moral superiority  thing, aren't you?"
Willow,(smiles) It's like a drug!
Buffy,Fine!  Okay.  I'm the bad. I can take my lumps . . . for a while.
Willow,All right.  I'll stop giving you a hard time. (pauses) Runaway.
Buffy,(gives her a surprised look) Will!
Willow,(smiles and giggles) I'm sorry!  Quitter.
Buffy,(widens her eyes at her) Whiner.
Willow,Bailer.
Buffy,Harpy.
Willow,Delinquent.
Buffy,Tramp.
Willow,(takes mock offense) Bad seed.
Buffy,Witch.
Willow,Freak.
