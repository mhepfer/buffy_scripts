GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
GLORY,"Did you know your sister took my key, Dawnie, and she won't give it back. I bet you know where she put it, don't you?"
SPIKE,"(reading) They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the key to her, in the form of a sister."
BEN: Let Glory understand this,I won't help her find the key. I would never do that to an innocent-
JINX,An innocent?
BEN,It's not a person.
GLORY,What about the key?
JINX,He indicated that it was a person.
SPIKE,"Oh God, no."
SPIKE,I love you.
BUFFY,The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
APRIL,You are not my boyfriend!
BUFFY,I kinda got the impression that she was a-
TARA,Robot.
XANDER,"Oh yeah, robot."
WARREN,She's a robot.
WARREN,I made her to love me. I didn't make a toy. I made a girlfriend.
SPIKE,I'm placing an order.
WARREN,"No, I'm not making any more girls."
SPIKE,Sure you are. (giving Warren the box full of Buffy pictures) Here's your specs.
BUFFY,Mom? What are you doing?
BUFFY,Mommy?
MINISTER,"We commend to almighty God our sister, Joyce Summers."
BUFFY,It's tomorrow that I'm worried about.
ANGEL,What's tomorrow?
BUFFY,That's exactly what I don't know.
BUFFY,"Giles, you don't have to help. You cooked."
GILES,"Oh, come on, I quite like to cook. Helping you two out makes me feel useful. (wiping a dish)"
DAWN,Wanna clean out the garage on Saturday? You can feel indispensable.
GILES,"(sarcastic) Hmm, how tempting."
BUFFY,"Dawn, if there are any plates in your room, let's have them before they get furry and we have to name them."
DAWN,"Hey, I was like five then."
GILES,How's she doing? (Buffy gives him a look) And you?
BUFFY,"I'm okay. Well, some minutes are harder than others."
GILES,I'm so sorry. All I can say is i-it will get better.
BUFFY,"It has to. (stops washing dishes, begins drying her hands) We're holding up though, you know, getting into a routine."
GILES,"Good, routine's good. In fact I was thinking that we might ... return to our training schedule."
BUFFY,"(pauses) I don't know. I was, um, thinking about ... maybe ... taking a break or something."
BUFFY,Just ease off for a while.  Not get into full slay mode.
GILES,But you were doing so well.
BUFFY,"A-and you were great, helping me with everything. (They sit on the sofa) I'm just ... starting to feel ... uneasy about stuff."
GILES,Stuff?
BUFFY,Training. Slaying. All of it. It's just  ... I mean ... I can beat up the demons until the cows come home. And then I can beat up the cows ... but I'm not sure I like what it's doing to me.
GILES,"But you've mastered so much. I mean, your strength and resilience alone-"
BUFFY,"Yeah. Strength, resilience ... those are all words for hardness. (pause) I'm starting to feel like ... being the Slayer is turning me into stone."
GILES,Turning you into stone? Buffy-
BUFFY,"Just ... think about it. (gets up, paces) I was never there for Riley, not like I was for Angel. I was terrible to Dawn."
GILES,At a time like this-
BUFFY,No.
GILES,You're bound to feel emotionally numb.
BUFFY,Before that. Riley left because I was shut down. He's gone. And now my mom is gone ... and I loved her more than anything ... and ... I don't know if she knew.
GILES,"Oh, she knew. (gets up, puts his hand on Buffy's shoulder) Always."
BUFFY,"I don't know. To slay, to kill ... i-it means being hard on the inside. Maybe being the perfect Slayer means being too hard to love at all. I already feel like I can hardly say the words."
GILES,Buffy...
BUFFY,"Giles ... I love you. Love ... love, love, love, love, Giles, it feels strange."
GILES,"Well, I shouldn't wonder. (frowns, sits on the coffee table) How serious are you about this?"
BUFFY,"(walks past him, sits on sofa) Ten. I'm serious to the amount of ten."
GILES,There is something ... in the Watchers' diaries ... a quest.
BUFFY,A quest? Like finding a grail or something?
GILES,"Not a grail. Maybe answers. It would take a day, perhaps two."
BUFFY,I'm not leaving Dawn. Not with Glory looking for her.
DAWN,Sure you can. (sits next to Buffy) What's the deal?
GILES,"Some Slayers before Buffy found it helpful in ... regaining their focus, learning more about their role. There's a sacred place in the desert. It's, it's not far."
BUFFY,"But I can't go. (to Dawn) I'm not leaving you, Dawn."
DAWN,"If you have to go learn ... I mean, if it'll help you out ... I think you should do it. (shot of Giles smiling) I can hang with the gang. I'll be okay."
BUFFY,"I love you, Dawn. You know that, right?"
DAWN,Yeah. I love you too.
BUFFY,I love you ... (intensely) *really* love you.
DAWN,(nervous grin) Gettin' weird.
BUFFY,Sorry. But it's important that I tell you. Weird love's better than no love.
Cut to,Spike staring at something. We see Warren in the background.
SPIKE,Some say it's better'n the real thing.
WARREN,(nervous) Better than the real thing.
SPIKE,"(OS) She looks good, but what about the rest?"
SPIKE,"A little walk, a little talk..."
SPIKE,...perhaps a zippy cartwheel...
WARREN,"Hey, she's, uh, great. You'll be real happy, I swear, she's got everything you asked for. All the extra programming, tons of real-world knowledge, the profiles you gave me about her family and friends."
SPIKE,"*All* the extra programming, right?"
WARREN,"Ah, the, the stuff that you wanted, the, uh, scenario responses, you know, the, uh, uh, special ... skills ... (nervous laugh) All of it. Now, you said that I could leave-"
SPIKE,"Wait. I'm not sure I'm a satisfied customer. She looks a little shiny to me, you know, uh..."
SPIKE,(OS) ...touch of plasticine...
BUFFYBOT,Spike?
BUFFYBOT,"Oh, Spike!"
SPIKE,She'll do.
GLORY,"(annoyed) He's getting stronger. I'm losing him, I'm losing control of him."
JINX,"You're speaking of Ben, most glamorous yet tasteful one?"
GLORY,He stabbed you in your body.
MURK,"Jinx is all right, your highness. And we do have the new knowledge that the key is a human being."
GLORY,(sits up) If time runs out on us and all we're left with is info? Then we're screwed.
JINX,"Oh, surely not!"
GLORY,"(leans back) No, we're screwed!"
MURK,But you are a god. The sacred Glorificus!
GLORY,"I'm a god in exile. Far from the hellfires of home and ... sharing my body with an enemy that stabs my boys in their (pokes Jinx in the stomach, he groans and winces) fleshy little stomachs."
GLORY,Uhh! I'm in pain.
JINX,How can we help? We'll lay down our lives.
GLORY,"The Slayer and the key are connected. She's going to have contact with it. Find out who's new in her life, who's ... special, who's different. Watch her."
MURK,"We can do that, O ... thou."
GLORY,I want to hear about everyone she has contact with! That girl has my key ... (the monks bow their heads) and I'm trusting you boys to get it for me. If you love me ... (they both look up) get it for me.
Cut to,"a slice of desert. There are sandy dunes with some scraggly bushes, and one tree. Heat waves shimmer in the air. Giles' convertible comes around the dune, pulls up and stops. Giles and Buffy get out. Giles goes to open the trunk. Buffy follows. She wears a long brown coat over brown pants and a brown turtleneck. Giles wears jeans, a black shirt and a brown suede jacket."
BUFFY,What's in the trunk?
GILES,Supplies. (leans into the trunk)
BUFFY,"Supplies? I was wondering about that. Like, food, water, maybe a compass?"
GILES,"(straightens up holding stuff) What about a book, a gourd, and a bunch of twigs?"
BUFFY,I don't think I'll be that hungry.
GILES,"They're for me. Come on, this way."
GILES,"You see, the location of the sacred place is a guarded secret. I can't take you there myself. (They begin to climb up a dune) I'll have to perform a ritual to ... transfer my guardianship of you, temporarily, to, to a guide. This'll do."
BUFFY,"A guide but no food or water. So it leads me to the sacred place, and then a week later it leads you to my bleached bones?"
GILES,"Buffy, please. It takes more than a week to bleach bones."
BUFFY,"So, how's it start?"
GILES,"I, uh, jump out of the circle and then jump back in it, and then,  um ... (embarrassed) I shake my gourd."
BUFFY,I know this ritual! The ancient shamans were next called upon to do the hokey-pokey and turn themselves around.
GILES,"(straightens up, gives her a sour look) Go quest."
BUFFY,And that's what it's all about.
Cut to,"Spike in his crypt, dancing around in sparring mode."
SPIKE,"What you searching for, Slayer, a weak spot? Hmm?"
SPIKE,"Try me, give me the best you've got."
BUFFYBOT,Ooh!
BUFFYBOT,Oh... (panting)
SPIKE,"Is that your best, Slayer?"
BUFFYBOT,No.
SPIKE,Why not?
BUFFYBOT,"I, I wanna hurt you, but I can't resist the sinister attraction of your cold and muscular body."
SPIKE,Maybe I should repay you for your gentleness. Maybe I should let you go.
BUFFYBOT,"No! No, Spike. Never let me go."
SPIKE,You know you should be afraid of me. I'm bad.
BUFFYBOT,"(seductively) You are. You're very, very bad."
SPIKE,Are you gonna do it that way?
BUFFYBOT,(grinning) No.
BUFFYBOT,This way.
SPIKE,(raises his eyebrows) You can't do it.
BUFFYBOT,"I could never do it. (drops the stake) I'm helpless against you, you fiend."
BUFFYBOT,(smiling) Oh!
SPIKE,(whispers) Buffy...
Cut to,Giles sitting on the sand in the middle of the circle of sticks. He has the book open and reads aloud in Swahili.
BUFFY,"Hello, kitty."
BUFFY,I know this place.
"Cut to: Tara closing a door. She turns away and we see there's a vial in her hand. She walks away from the door, into the room. We see Xander behind a counter",it's his apartment. He comes out from behind the counter.
TARA,Okay. Warning spell's all set.
XANDER,So that's it? We're all protected up for the night?
TARA,"Well, i-it's probably not as good as Willow could do. She's a natural with magic. In just the time I've known her, she's already blown right past me."
XANDER,"So, when the whiz kid gets back from chem lab, can you have her ... you know, bulk up the spell a little? If you want, maybe, while Anya and I go do a quick patrol?"
ANYA,"I don't see why we have to patrol just 'cause Buffy's away. (gets up, walks over to them) I'd rather stay home and watch television."
TARA,"(OS) Oh yeah, Willow wants to watch this thing on the history channel tonight, (Dawn gets up, walks over to the table) Salem Witch Trial stuff, which is only gonna get her all upset."
ANYA,"(OS) Oh, I was there, it really wasn't that bad. (Dawn picks up the earrings and puts them in her pocket) See, if you were really a witch, you could do a spell to escape."
ANYA,"...so really it was only bad for the falsely accused, and, well, they never have a good time."
XANDER,No.
DAWN,"So, guys, if this is a real slumber party, where's the pizza?"
Cut to,"Spike's crypt. Pan across the pillars and the armchair to find Spike and the Buffy Bot lying on the floor, on their sides. She lies in front with Spike behind her, his arm around her waist, both covered with a pink sheet. Spike's hair is all disarrayed and spikey."
BUFFYBOT,You're evil.
SPIKE,And that excites you?
BUFFYBOT,"It excites me, it terrifies me ... I try so hard to resist you and I can't."
SPIKE,Yeah? (grins)
BUFFYBOT,Darn your sinister attraction.
SPIKE,(seriously) Are you afraid of me?
BUFFYBOT,(big smile) Yes.
SPIKE,(quietly) You know I can't lie to you.
BUFFYBOT,"I think you can. I think you can if I let you, and I want to let you. I want you to bite me and devour me until there's no more."
SPIKE,(smiles) Like this?
BUFFYBOT,"(smiling) Oh, Spike, devour me!"
SPIKE,All right.
BUFFYBOT,"Spike, I can't help myself. I love you."
SPIKE,"You're mine, Buffy."
BUFFYBOT,Should I start this program over?
SPIKE,Shh! (frowns) No programs. Don't use that word. Just be Buffy.
Cut to,"Willow and a bunch of other students coming out of a UC Sunnydale building, night."
WILLOW,It's got last week's notes too. Just get it back to me by Thursday.
WILLOW,"And, uh, don't write in it or, or, uh, put a coffee mug down on it, or anything. (The student walks offscreen) And, and, just don't spill. Okay. Oh, oh, and don't fold the page corners down. Bye!"
Cut to,"Spike lying in his bed asleep. Pan across to the Buffy Bot standing next to the bed, putting on her jacket."
BUFFYBOT,Time to slay.
SPIKE,Yeah... (mumbling in his sleep)
BUFFYBOT,"Vampires of the world, beware."
Cut to,"the Buffy-Bot walking through the graveyard, twirling her stake. Xander and Anya come around a corner."
BUFFYBOT,Hey there!
XANDER,Buffy!
BUFFYBOT,Xander!
At the bottom is a readout that identifies Xander with attributes,
BUFFYBOT,(OS) And ...
The point of view shifts to Anya. Her attributes are,
BUFFYBOT,(OS) Anya!
BUFFYBOT,How is your money?
ANYA,(laughs in surprise) Fine. Thank you for asking. (smiles at Xander)
BUFFYBOT,(smiling) Isn't it a beautiful night for killing evil things?
XANDER,I guess.
ANYA,You're back very early.
XANDER,"Yeah, how was the whole vision-quest experience?"
BUFFYBOT,I don't understand that question. But thank you for asking.
BUFFYBOT,"You're my friend, and a carpenter."
XANDER,Are you all right? You're all...
SPIKE,(OS) Hey! Wait up!
BUFFYBOT,(happily) Spike! (to Xander and Anya) It's Spike. And he's wearing a coat.
SPIKE,(panting) Yes. Uh ... hello all.
SPIKE,"Uh, Buffy's back early, I see. Lots of patrolling all around tonight, then, is it?"
SPIKE,"Ow! Hey. Give a fella a break there, Slayer."
SPIKE,"Uh, I'm glad you're all here, uh, 'cause, uh, 'cause ... the place is crawling with vamps tonight. Uh, tons of 'em. I, uh, think we oughta split up."
XANDER,"We haven't seen any vamps, are you sure there's..."
ANYA,You're right.
SPIKE,"Yep, guess so."
BUFFYBOT,"Spike, be careful!"
BUFFYBOT,"No, get away from him."
SPIKE,I think that was probably the big action for the night. You two can toddle on home if you want.
XANDER,Uh ... Buffy?
BUFFYBOT,(smiling) Yes. Spike and I will do it alone. You guys head home.
BUFFYBOT,Hmm. I don't understand this. I-I did the slaying. I should be...
SPIKE,(leering) Satisfied?
BUFFYBOT,"(nods, pouts) But I'm not. I-I'm all ... (wiggles her shoulders) my skin is all hot. (Spike grinning) Do I look hot to you?"
SPIKE,Always.
BUFFYBOT,(suggestively) You better feel me to make sure.
SPIKE,I can do that.
ANYA,(coughs) I breathed in like a quart of vampire dust. That can't be good. (putting her stake away in a coat pocket)
XANDER,I wish Giles told us they were back from the desert. I wish I knew what went on there.
ANYA,"Oh, you know, Slayer-Watcher stuff. Probably some silly ritual with an enchanted prairie dog or something."
XANDER,"(shakes head) Whatever it was, I think she's still a little spacy."
ANYA,(shrugs) She fought okay.
XANDER,"Yeah. (stops walking) Hey, she never asked about Dawn."
ANYA,That's true.
XANDER,Something's wrong.
XANDER,(softly) I hear something.
BUFFYBOT,Oh Spike. You're the big bad.
BUFFYBOT,(OS) You're the BIG bad!
WILLOW,Those darn Salem judges. With their less-satanic-than-thou attitude.
TARA,"Oh, honey, let's change it. The Discovery channel has koala bears."
XANDER,Where's Dawn?
TARA,"She, she's in the bedroom, she fell asleep."
XANDER,Good.
WILLOW,What's goin' on?
XANDER,Buffy's gone insane. (Anya nods)
WILLOW,What? What'd she do?
XANDER,Brace yourself. You're not gonna believe it.
TARA,"Everyone, before we jump all over her, people do strange things when someone they love dies. When I lost my mother, I-I did some pretty dumb stuff, like lying to my family and staying out all night."
ANYA,Buffy's boinking Spike.
WILLOW,"(pause) Oh ... well, Ta-Tara's right. Grief can be powerful, and we shouldn't judge-"
TARA,"What are you, kidding? She's nuts!"
WILLOW,"Well, it's not healthy, we're all agreeing there."
TARA,What can we do?
ANYA,Sometimes in the movies when they go crazy they slap 'em.
XANDER,"I'm gonna go find her and talk to her. If she's losing it, we gotta help her before she gets herself hurt."
TARA,"You aren't really gonna slap her, are you?"
XANDER,"No, but if I have to see her straddle Spike again, I will definitely knock myself unconscious."
Cut to,Buffy asleep on a rock. There's a fire burning nearby. She sits up.
BUFFY,Hello? Who's there?
Cut to,"Spike leaning against a pillar, smoking a cigarette. His hair is again messy. Rustling noises. Spike looks toward the door as the Buffy Bot rises from the floor in front of him. They both look over at the noise."
BUFFYBOT,Who's that?
SPIKE,"(begins fastening his pants) Uh ... Down there. (points to the trapdoor leading down to the cavern) And, uh, no matter what, don't come out till I get you, okay?"
BUFFYBOT,(nods) Okay.
SPIKE,"Oh, it's you."
XANDER,(closes door) I saw you ... in the cemetery with Buffy.
SPIKE,Yeah? (with bravado) Can't see how it's any business of yours.
XANDER,"It is my business because Buffy's my friend .. and she's gone through some stuff lately that ... well, it's affected her, and you're taking advantage of her."
SPIKE,"(sighs) She's upset about her mum. (takes a drag on his cigarette) And if she turns to me for comfort, well, I'm not gonna deny it to her. I'm not a monster."
XANDER,Yes. You are a monster. Vampires are monsters. They make monster movies about them.
SPIKE,"(sarcastic) Well, yeah, you got me there."
XANDER,"Spike, Buffy has lost of friends, and we love her very much, and we'll do whatever it takes to protect her. Now if that means killing you, then, well, that's just a bonus."
JINX,"Gentlemen! (begins to enter, followed by more demons) I'm so sorry to intrude, but I wondered if I might beg a moment of your time."
SPIKE,(to Xander) Friends of yours?
SPIKE,Guess not.
JINX,Tie his hands! Glory will want him restrained.
SPIKE,(struggling) Let me go!
JINX,Careful with him. She will want the key intact.
SPIKE,Key? Who's a key? I'm not the-
BUFFY,I know you. You're the first Slayer.
FIRST SLAYER,This is a form. I am the guide.
BUFFY,I have a few questions ... about being the Slayer. What about ... love? Not just boyfriend love.
FIRST SLAYER,You think you're losing your ability to love.
BUFFY,I-I didn't say that. (sighs) Yeah.
FIRST SLAYER,You're afraid that being the Slayer means losing your humanity.
BUFFY,Does it?
FIRST SLAYER,You are full of love. You love with all of your soul. It's brighter than the fire ... blinding. That's why you pull away from it.
BUFFY,(surprised) I'm full of love? I'm not losing it?
FIRST SLAYER,"Only if you reject it. Love is pain, and the Slayer forges strength from pain. Love ... give ... forgive. Risk the pain. It is your nature. Love will bring you to your gift."
BUFFY,(pause) What?
BUFFYBOT,"Spike? (looks around) I waited like you said, but then I missed you. Spike?"
Cut to,"darkness, sound of someone knocking on a door."
WILLOW,"Xander, did you-"
BUFFYBOT,Spike's gone!
WILLOW,"Bu-Buffy. Uh, come in. Shh! It's late!"
WILLOW,Wait.
WILLOW,(whispers) We can talk out here.
WILLOW,Did Xander find you? He-he was looking for you.
Shot of Willow from the bot's perspective. Her attributes are,
WILLOW,He hasn't come back. Anya sat up waiting.
BUFFYBOT,"I don't know where Xander is. I haven't seen him. And when I came out of the tunnel, Spike was gone. I need to find him."
WILLOW,"(winces) Um ... Buffy, this thing with Spike, i-i-it isn't true, is it? You didn't, you know, sleep with Spike?"
BUFFYBOT,No.
BUFFYBOT,I had sex with Spike. (Willow winces again) I'm sorry if it bothers you. You're my best friend.
WILLOW,"I-I am. And I, I always will be, no matter what you do. I, I'm just trying to figure out why this happened, and I, I think with ... your mom and everything ... everyone was being all sympathetic, and, and making you feel weak. A-and Spike wasn't like that. So, just this one time, you just ... did something kinda ... crazy."
BUFFYBOT,(shakes head) It wasn't one time. It was lots of times. And lots of different ways. I could make sketches.
WILLOW,"(disgusted) No! Buffy, there is something seriously wrong here! I ... (the bot looks confused) Okay, yeah, you've been with a vampire before, but Angel had a soul."
BUFFYBOT,"Angel's lame. His hair grows straight up, and he's bloody stupid."
WILLOW,"(confused) Okay ... look, I just wanna help you. Let me help you."
BUFFYBOT,You're my best friend.
WILLOW,"Yeah. Again, I ... really am, but..."
BUFFYBOT,You're recently gay.
WILLOW,Um...
XANDER,"(inside) Guys! Guys, wake up."
ANYA,"Oh, Xander, I was scared, are you hurt? What happened?"
XANDER,Guys ... demony kinds of guys. Buffy.
BUFFYBOT,"Yes, that's me."
XANDER,"The guys that work for Glory, you said they're kind of like hobbits with leprosy? Well this was a whole flock of hobbits, and they just grabbed Spike. I think they're taking him to Glory."
WILLOW,"But he, he knows about Dawn. (Xander nods)"
BUFFYBOT,We have to get him back. (Willow gives her a disturbed look)
XANDER,So how do we find him?
BUFFYBOT,I fight with weapons.
XANDER,"Yeah. I got nothin'. Let's hit your place, we'll stock up."
WILLOW,"Uh, Tara, can you stay here a-and watch Dawn?"
TARA,Of course.
BUFFY,"I-I'm sorry, I, I'm just a little confused. I'm full of love, which is nice, and ... love will lead me to my gift?"
FIRST SLAYER,Yes.
BUFFY,"I'm getting a gift? Or, or do you mean that, that I have a gift to give to someone else?"
FIRST SLAYER,Death is your gift.
BUFFY,Death ...
FIRST SLAYER,Is your gift.
BUFFY,"Okay, no. Death is not a gift. My mother just died. I know this. If I have to kill demons because it makes the world a better place, then I kill demons, but it's not a gift to anybody."
FIRST SLAYER,Your question has been answered.
Cut to,"Glory's apartment. The door bursts open and the two main demons enter with Spike, whose hands are tied behind him. Glory gets up from the sofa where she was reading a magazine."
GLORY,"What the hell is that, and why is his hair that color?"
MURK,"Stunning one, we believe he is..."
MURK AND JINX,(unison) The key!
GLORY,"Really? That's fantabulous! (comes forward, shoves Murk away) And impossible. (walks in a circle around Spike) He can't be the key, because, see, the key ... has to be pure."
GLORY,"This is a vampire. (Spike looks at her in alarm) Lesson number one, vampires equal impure."
SPIKE,"(a little scared) Yeah, damn right I'm impure. I'm as impure as the driven yellow snow. Let me go."
GLORY,You can't even brain-suck a vampire. (pats Spike on the chest) He's completely useless.
SPIKE,"So, I'm just gonna let myself out."
JINX,"But, your holiness, we observed the Slayer. She protected this one above all others. (Glory looks over his shoulder at Spike) She treated him as precious."
GLORY,Really? Precious-ss-ss?
GLORY,"Let's take a peek at you, precious. (looks him up and down)"
SPIKE,Sod off.
GLORY,Oh... (laughs)
GLORY,He doesn't look very fancy to me. (grabs Spike by the lower lip and pulls him upright)
SPIKE,"Hey, watch the lip!"
GLORY,"But if the Slayer protects him, maybe appearances are deceiving."
GLORY,Maybe there's something on the inside.
GLORY,"Shhh. What do you know, precious? What can I dig out of you?"
Cut to,"Summers house, day. Xander opens the door for the Buffy Bot, who enters followed by Xander, Anya, and Willow. They walk into the living room."
BUFFYBOT,(smiling) This is my house.
XANDER,"If we're gonna stop Spike from blabbing about Dawn, we're gonna need these."
ANYA,"Ooh, the big guns."
ANYA,Saddling up. Shouldn't we have guns?
BUFFYBOT,Those are my weapons. Give me something big and sharp.
WILLOW,"Um, Buffy, where do we go? Where should we look for Glory?"
BUFFYBOT,She's a god. She wants the key.
XANDER,"Yeah, so we should look..."
BUFFYBOT,I don't know. Why are you all looking at me? (They all look confused)
XANDER,"Okay, Buff, it's okay, you're right, you shouldn't have to know everything."
BUFFYBOT,We need to rescue Spike.
WILLOW,"Um ... Buffy, I, I think you have more weapons upstairs. Why don't you go get those?"
ANYA,"And maybe change your clothes, you know, something more ... fighty."
BUFFYBOT,I can do that. I'll be right back.
XANDER,"Okay, this has gone way too far. She thinks we're going to rescue Spike."
WILLOW,What *are* we gonna do?
XANDER,"Find him, keep him from talking, whatever it takes."
ANYA,What do we do with Glory?
WILLOW,"Whatever we do, we're gonna need Buffy's help."
XANDER,Then we're gonna have to talk to her.
WILLOW,Intervention time again?
XANDER,"Yeah, 'cause what we need right now is a sane Buffy."
BUFFY,Whoa. Group hang time?
WILLOW,Tha-that was quick.
BUFFY,Didn't seem like it to me. Death is my gift. (scoffs)
XANDER,"Buffy, we need to talk."
BUFFY,(alarmed) What's wrong? Is Dawn okay?
WILLOW,Dawn's fine.
XANDER,"Buffy, we care about you, and we're worried about you. The way you're acting, the things you're doing-"
ANYA,It's wrong.
WILLOW,Wait. This shouldn't be about blame.
BUFFY,Blame? There's blame now?
WILLOW,"No, there's only love. And ... some fear."
ANYA,Which is kind of thrown by the you having sex with Spike.
BUFFY,The ... who whating how with huh?
ANYA,"Okay, that's denial. That usually comes before anger."
BUFFY,(angrily) I am not having sex with Spike!
ANYA,Anger.
XANDER,No one is judging you. It's understandable. Spike is strong and mysterious and sort of compact but well-muscled.
BUFFY,(firmly) I am not having sex with Spike! But I'm starting to think that you might be.
XANDER,"(scoffs) Buffy, I saw you. Anya too. (Anya nods) We saw you and Spike ... (gestures vaguely) with the straddling."
BUFFYBOT,Spike's mine. Who's straddling Spike?
BUFFY,Oh my god.
XANDER,(amazed) And so say all of us.
BUFFYBOT,"Say, look at you. You look just like me! We're very pretty."
WILLOW,Two of them!
XANDER,"Hey, I know this! They're both Buffy!"
BUFFY,"(annoyed at him) No, *she*'s a robot. She acts just like that girlfriend-bot that Warren guy made. You guys couldn't tell me apart from a robot?"
BUFFYBOT,"Oh, I don't think I'm a robot."
ANYA,She's very well done.
XANDER,Spike must have had her built so he could program her t-
BUFFY,(horrified) Oh god.
WILLOW,Yikes. Imagine the things-
BUFFY,"No! No, no imagining. Any of you."
XANDER,(raises his hand) Already got the visual.
BUFFYBOT,People. Friends of mine. You're forgetting the most important thing. Glory has Spike and she's going to harm him.
BUFFY,(softly) Glory has Spike?
XANDER,(nervous laugh) We were gonna bring that up.
ANYA,We were getting weapons.
BUFFY,Grab 'em. We're going now. I have to kill him.
WILLOW,We don't even know where to look.
BUFFY,(ponders) I know where to start.
Cut to,Glory's apartment. Spike's hands are tied together over his head. He stands in the middle of the room with the demons around the edges. His shirt is torn partly off and his facc is bloody.
GLORY,"I have a riddle for you, precious. How is a vampire that won't talk ... like an apple?"
GLORY,Think I can do you in one long strip?
SPIKE,(weakly) Enough. No more. I'll tell you who the sodding key is.
BUFFY,(OS) Glory's key-sniffing snake was about here when I killed it. It was headed back to her.
WILLOW,(OS) Do you think she lives around here?
XANDER,It's not a lot to go on.
BUFFY,(shrugs) It's all we got.
GILES,(staring at the bot) Quite extraordinary really.
BUFFYBOT,"Thank you. But I really think we should be listening to the other Buffy, Giles. (She pronounces it with a hard G like ""guy"") She's very smart and she's gonna help us save Spike."
GILES,Guy-les? (turns to address the real Buffy) Spike didn't even bother to program my name properly.
BUFFY,"Listen, skirt girl, we are not going to save him. We're going to kill him. He knows who the key is, and there's no way he's not telling Glory."
BUFFYBOT,You're right. He's evil. (smiles) But you should see him naked. I mean really.
BUFFY,"Okay, guys, split up and spread out. Check the priciest-looking places first. Xander, you come with me. Willow, Anya, stick together, and Guy-les ... Giles- (Giles looks annoyed) you can watch ... it."
Cut to,Glory holding a glass of water to Spike's lips. He drinks it all. Blood from the wound above his eye and the wound in his lip is trickling down his cheeks making him look quite battered.
GLORY,Is that better? (Spike coughs) Do you think you can try to talk again now? (Spike nods) Good. Because I'm tired of these games!
GLORY,"(turns away) ""I need time, I need a drink,"" you're a very needy little bloodsucker, (sits on the sofa) and it's not very attractive."
GLORY,So start talkin'.
SPIKE,Yeah. Okay. The key. Here's the thing...
SPIKE,It's that guy... on TV ... what's his name?
GLORY,(frowns) On the television?
SPIKE,That show ... the prize show ... where they guess what stuff cost?
MURK,The Price Is Right?
JINX,"Oh, Bob Barker!"
MURK,We will bring you Bob Barker! We will bring you the limp and beaten body of Bob Bark-
GLORY,"(jumps up) It is not Bob Barker, scabby morons! The key is new to this world ... (turns back to face Spike) and Bob Barker is as old as grit. (smiles) The vampire ... is lying to me."
SPIKE,"(giggles weakly) Yeah ... but it was fun. And guess what, bitch. (Shot of his hands still trying to twist free) I'm not telling you jack. You're never gonna get your sodding key, 'cause you might be strong, but in our world, you're an idiot."
GLORY,I am a god.
SPIKE,"The god of what, bad home perms?"
GLORY,"Shut up! (takes a few steps toward him, pats her hair) I command you, shut up!"
SPIKE,"Yeah, okay, sorry, but I just had no idea that gods were such prancing lightweights. (Glory scoffs in disbelief) Mark my words, the Slayer ... is going to kick your skanky, lopsided ass (Glory checks out her ass in dismay) back to whatever place would take a (sizing her up) cheap, whorish, fashion victim ex-god like you."
SPIKE,"(mutters) Good plan, Spike."
GLORY,Bring him back.
Cut to,"Spike bloodied and limping, dragging himself down the hall toward the elevator. The elevator doors close before he reaches them. One of Glory's demons comes around the corner and sees him."
DEMON,Here!
SPIKE,"Oh, god."
MURK,You do not insult Glory by escaping.
MURK,Slayer!
GILES,"Buffy, we're here."
BUFFYBOT,Spike! Spike's in there!
GILES,Buffy!
Cut to,Glory's apartment. Jinx and Murk attempt to explain to Glory what happened.
JINX,The Slayer was there.
MURK,A lethal fighter.
JINX,She seemed to be everywhere at once.
MURK,She had friends. With many weapons!
JINX,They may have been demons.
GLORY,(smiles) And where's my vampire?
Cut to,shot of the Buffy Bot's back. A flap of skin is peeled back revealing her inner workings. Willow is poking at the machinery with tools. It makes sputtering noises.
TARA,(looks across the table) Is it weird?
BUFFY,Oh yeah. (walks closer) At least it's not a very good copy. (sits in the chair next to the bot) I mean...
BUFFY,...look at it.
WILLOW,Uh ... yeah. (looks up at Tara)
BUFFY,What'd you guys do with Spike? And please let the story have a dusty ending.
XANDER,We dumped him back in his crypt.
GILES,"Tried to find out if he'd ... told her anything, but he was too badly beaten to make much sense."
ANYA,"Well, even if he told her, he'd just lie to us about it anyway, right?"
BUFFY,"Yeah, you can count on it. But I have to know. Now. If he did give us up, Dawn and I need to get out of town. I mean, she could be on her way right now."
GILES,"(to Dawn) But, uh, not to worry, you know, I'm sure we'll all be perfectly safe."
DAWN,"(smiles) We're safe, right. And, uh, Spike built a robot Buffy to play checkers with."
TARA,I-it sounded convincing when I thought it.
WILLOW,Hey! I-I think I found somethin'.
ANYA,"Uch! Looks very complicated in there. Personally, I'd rather look at guts."
WILLOW,(to Buffy) I found where she's broken. Some of these wires got fried extra crispy. (smiles) It's an easy fix.
WILLOW,I mean ... not that I would.
XANDER,"God, I feel ... kind of bad for the guy. Gets all whupped and his best toy gets taken away."
BUFFY,Xander. Please don't be suggesting what I'd have to kill you for suggesting.
XANDER,"No, no, travesty, completely on board, it's just ... the guy was so thrashed."
Cut to,"Spike lying in his crypt, daylight outside. His facial bruises have swelled up and his hair is still messy."
BUFFYBOT,Spike! You're covered in sexy wounds.
SPIKE,Yeah. (starts to sit up) I feel real sexy. (slowly pulls himself upright) Where you been?
BUFFYBOT,I fell down and got confused. Willow fixed me. She's gay.
SPIKE,Will fixed you? I thought they'd melt you into scrap.
BUFFYBOT,They were confused too. (smiles) Do you wanna ravage me now?
SPIKE,(weakly) Give us a minute. Got some bones need mending.
BUFFYBOT,Why did you let that Glory hurt you?
SPIKE,She wanted to know who the key was.
BUFFYBOT,"Oh, well, I can tell her, and then you'll-(turns to leave)"
SPIKE,No! (coughs as she turns back) You can't ever. Glory never finds out.
BUFFYBOT,Why?
SPIKE,"(quietly) 'Cause Buffy ... the other, not so pleasant Buffy ... anything happened to Dawn, it'd destroy her. I couldn't live, her bein' in that much pain. Let Glory kill me first. Nearly bloody did."
SPIKE,And my robot?
BUFFY,(turns back) The robot is gone. The robot was gross and obscene.
SPIKE,(lowers his head) It wasn't supposed to-
BUFFY,"Don't. That ... thing, it ... it wasn't even real."
BUFFY,"What you did, for me, and Dawn ... that was real."
BUFFY,I won't forget it.
