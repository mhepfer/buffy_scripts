WILLOW,"<br>    Yes, absolutely."
GILES,"<br>    (paces) &quot;M&quot; plus glottal stop is represented by a picture that's     commonly thought to symbolize a sickle or a scythe. It's in thousands of carvings.     In Egypt, throughout the ancient world."
WILLOW,"<br>    Carvings like you'd have on a pagan temple?"
GILES,"<br>    Go back. See what else we can find out about this temple. (picks up the weapon)     The scythe is a symbol of death. Let's see where these pagans buried their     dead."
