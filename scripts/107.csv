GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer...</I>
SPIKE,I love you.
BUFFY,Oh my god.
WILLOW,Here lies the warrior of the people. Let her cross over.
BUFFY,"I think I was in heaven. I was torn out of there, by my friends. They can never know."
GILES,We can't ignore this kind of behavior.
GILES,Something needs to be done before it spins out of control.
BUFFY,I'm glad you're here to take care of it.
XANDER,We're getting married.
TARA,Congratulations.
TARA,"Willow, you are using too much magic."
TARA,Can we not do this now?
WILLOW,Just ... forget it ever happened.
WILLOW,Forget.
"Open in Buffy's bedroom, morning. The words ""<I>Once More, With Feeling</I>"" splash across the screen in the style of an old movie musical. Pan down to reveal an old-fashioned alarm clock (the kind with actual bells). The clock hits 7",00 and the alarm goes off.

BUFFY,"(distracted) What? Oh, uh, yeah. I think so."
XANDER,Respect the cruller. And tame the donut!
ANYA,"That's still funny, sweetie."
BUFFY,"So, uh, no research? Nothing going on? Monsters or whatnot?"
BUFFY,"Good! Good. (awkwardly) Uh, so, did anybody ... uh ... last night, you know, did anybody, um ... burst into song?"
XANDER,Merciful Zeus!
WILLOW,We thought it was just us!
GILES,"Well, I sang but I had my guitar at the hotel..."
TARA,It was bizarre. We were talking and then it was like-
BUFFY,Like you were in a musical!
TARA,Yeah!
GILES,That would explain the huge backing orchestra I couldn't see and the synchronized dancing from the room service chaps.
WILLOW,We did a whole duet about dish washing.
ANYA,"And we were arguing and, and then everything rhymed and there were harmonies and the dance with coconuts."
WILLOW,There was an entire verse about the cous-cous.
XANDER,It was very disturbing.
GILES,(to Buffy) What did you sing about?
BUFFY,(pauses) I don't remember. But i-it seemed perfectly normal.
XANDER,"But disturbing. And not the natural order of things, and do you think it'll happen again?"
GILES,I don't know. I should look into it.
WILLOW,With the books.
TARA,Do we have any books on this?
XANDER,"Well, we just gotta break it down. Look at the factors before it happens again. Because I for one-"

XANDER,"(sits) See, okay, that was disturbing."
WILLOW,(sits) I thought it was neat.
BUFFY,So what is it? What's causing it?
GILES,I thought it didn't matter.
BUFFY,"Well, I'm not exactly quaking in my stylish yet affordable boots, but there's definitely something unnatural going on here. And that doesn't usually lead to hugs and puppies."
ANYA,"Well, is it just us? I mean, is it only happening to us? (Buffy turns away) 'Cause that would probably mean a spell or-"

DAWN,Oh my god. You will never believe what happened at school today.
BUFFY,Everybody started singing and dancing?
DAWN,I gave birth to a pterodactyl.
ANYA,"Oh my god, did it sing?"
DAWN,"So, you guys too, huh? (walks closer)"
XANDER,So what'd you guys sing about?
DAWN,(sighs) Math.
TARA,"(loudly) Tha-That's right! The, the volume. The text."
GILES,What text?
WILLOW,"The volume-y text. You know? The, the (mumbles) report."
XANDER,The what now?
TARA,"Oh, there's just a few volumes back at the house that deal with mystical chants, bacchanals."
TARA,It might be relevant.
WILLOW,"Yeah, we could, um-"
GILES,"Well, I'm a hair's breadth from investigating bunnies at the moment, so I'm open to anything."
WILLOW,"Great, we'll, uh, go check it out and uh, we'll give you a call."
TARA,"Yeah, this could blow the whole thing wide open."
TARA,Do we have any books at all at home?
WILLOW,"Well, who wants to be cooped up on a day like this? The sun is shining, there's songs going on..."
WILLOW,...those guys are checking you out.
TARA,What? (turns to look) Wh-What are they looking at?
WILLOW,"The hotness of you, doofus."
TARA,Those boys really thought I was hot? (looks back at them again)
WILLOW,Entirely.
TARA,Oh my god. I'm cured! I want the boys!
WILLOW,Do I have to fight to keep you? 'Cause I'm not large with the butch.
TARA,I'm just ... not used to that. They-they were really looking at me?
WILLOW,(fondly) And you can't imagine what they see in you.

GILES,I'm sure Willow and Tara are making every effort.
XANDER,"Oh, yeah."
BUFFY,Xander.
DAWN,"Buffy, it's okay. I do know about this stuff. Besides, it's all kinda romantic."
BUFFY/XANDER,No it's not!

SWEET,That's entertainment.
XANDER VOICEOVER,"You want some breakfast, baby?"
ANYA,You don't have to go to work?
XANDER,"Nah, I shut the crew down for the day. My guys start dancing around me, I don't know if I can deal. It's a flab thing. So, waffles?"
ANYA,Will you still make me waffles when we're married?

MARTI,
XANDER,As in burnt up? Somebody set people on fire? That's nuts!
ANYA,I don't know. One more verse of our little ditty and I would've been looking for a gas can.
GILES,"Well, clearly emotions are running high. (We see people in background dancing together) But as far as I can tell these people burnt up from the inside, spontaneously combusted. (Three street sweeper men in background dancing with brooms) I've only seen the one. I was able to examine the body while the police were taking witness arias."
"XANDER: Okay, but we're sure that the things are related","the singing and dancing, and burning and dying."
GILES,"We're not sure of much. Buffy's looking for leads at the local demon haunts, at least ... in theory she is, but ... she doesn't seem to-"
XANDER,She's easing back into it. We pulled her out of an untold hell dimension. Ergo the weirdness. The important thing is to be there for her.
GILES,"(shakes head) I'm helping her as much as I can, but, uh..."
SPIKE,The sun sets and she appears. (climbs up the rest of the way) Come to serenade me?
BUFFY,So you know what's going on.
SPIKE,"Well, I've seen some damn funny things in the last two days. A 600 pound Chirago demon making like Yma Sumac, that one will stay with you. I remain immune, happy to say. (holds up a bottle of whiskey) Drink?"
BUFFY,A world of no. (sits) So any idea what's causing this?
SPIKE,(disappointed) Oh. So that's all. You've just come to pump me for information.
BUFFY,"What else would I wanna pump you for? (cringes) I really just said that, didn't I?"
SPIKE,"Yeah, well ... don't wanna bore you with the small talk."
SPIKE,Don't know a thing.

DAWN,"Ah, math. It seemed cool when we were singing about it."
TARA,"(smiles) Willow said they have a lead on the whole musical extravaganza evil. This demon that can be summoned, some sort of Lord of the Dance. (grins) Oh, but not the scary one. Just a demon."
DAWN,Um ... do they know who summoned it?
TARA,They don't even know its name yet. But Willow will find out. She's the brainy type. (smiles)
DAWN,Hm. (smiles at Tara) I'm glad you guys made up.
TARA,What?
DAWN,That fight you guys had about magic and stuff? It gives me belly rumblings when you guys fight.
TARA,"(confused) Dawn, Willow and I never fought about-"
DAWN,It's okay. It's just ... you guys are so great together. I just hate it when you-
DAWN,But that was the only fight I've seen you guys have anyway. But I'm still glad it's over.
TARA,"(staring at the herb) Dawn, I, um ... there's something I need at the shop. Will you be okay for a little while?"
DAWN,Yes. The fifteen-year-old can spend a half an hour alone in her locked house.

BUFFY,"(puts one leg up on the horse, stretches) Oh, you'll figure it out. I'm just worried this whole session's gonna turn into some training montage from an 80's movie."
GILES,"Ah. Well, if we hear any inspirational power chords, we'll just lie down until they go away. (picks up a towel) Anyway, I don't think we need to work that much on your strength."

MINION,My master has the Slayer's sister hostage at the Bronze because she summoned him and at midnight he's going to take her to the underworld to be his queen.
GILES,What does he want?
MINION,(indicates Buffy) Her.
SPIKE,"(scoffs) If that's all you've got to say, then-"
SPIKE,(surprised) Strong. Someday he'll be a real boy.
BUFFY,So. Dawn's in trouble. Must be Tuesday.

BUFFY,"Oh, it's not your fault. So what's the plan?"
XANDER,"Plan, schman. Let's mount up."
GILES,No.
ANYA,"Uh, Dawn may have had the wrong idea in summoning this creature, but ... I've seen some of these underworld child bride deals and, and they never end well. Well, maybe once."
WILLOW,We're not just gonna stay here.
GILES,Yes we are. (looks intently at Buffy) Buffy's going alone.
SPIKE,(disgusted laugh) Gah! Don't be a stupid git. There is no-
GILES,"If I want your opinion, Spike, I'll- (pauses to consider) I'll never want your opinion."
WILLOW,A little confusion spell could-
TARA,"No! (Willow looks surprised) I mean, I don't think it'll help."
SPIKE,"(to Buffy) Look, forget them, Slayer. I've got your back."
BUFFY,I thought you wanted me to stay away from you. Isn't that what you sang?
XANDER,Spike sing a widdle song?
ANYA,Would you say it was a breakaway pop hit or more of a book number?
