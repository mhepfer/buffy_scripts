Giles walks down the hall toward her     room and stops at the doorway.","</p><p><b>GILES</b><br>  You know this is very dangerous."
BUFFY,"<br>  Ah, you just heard the horror stories. Wear hoops, they'll catch on something,   rip your lobe off. Lobes flying everywhere."
GILES,"<br>  (rolls eyes) That's not what I'm talking about."
BUFFY,"<br>  You mean Spike not having a chip. Free range Spike?"
GILES,"<br>  I have to ask&#151;why on Earth did you make that decision?"
BUFFY,"<br>  Guess it was instinct, like you were talking about."
GILES,"<br>  I made that up! (walks into the room) I knew the Bringer was there because his   shoes squeaked. (sits on her vanity) Buffy, it's crucial that we keep these   girls safe. I can't count the dangers&#151;the First, the Bringers, random demons,   and now Spike?"
BUFFY,"<br>  And the Principal."
GILES,"<br>  What?"
BUFFY,"<br>  Oh, nothing much. He was in the school basement, holding a shovel, acting evasive.   Plus, he's got that whole &quot;too charming to be real&quot; thing going on.   I'm looking into it."
GILES,"<br>  (stands) Oh, well that sounds very responsible of you. Balances out the vampire-on-the-loose   issue."
BUFFY,"<br>  (stands, walks across the room to fold laundry) Nothing's changed, Giles. Spike   had a chip before, remember? When the First had him kill and sire all those   people."
GILES,"<br>  We have no idea if his chip was working then. (takes off glasses) A new chip   might restrain him should the First attempt to activate him again."
BUFFY,"<br>  (turns to face Giles) Spike has a soul now. That's what's gonna stop him from   hurting people."
GILES,"<br>  Buffy..."
BUFFY,"<br>  He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it. But he's never gonna get there if we   don't give him the chance. (walks to her closet to put the clothes away)"
GILES,"<br>  (walks up to Buffy) Buffy, I want more for you. Your feelings for him are coloring   your judgement. I can hear it in your voice. (Buffy sighs) And that way lies   a future filled with pain. I don't want that for you."
BUFFY,"<br>    We haven't&#151; (looks uncomfortable) Things have been different since he     came back."
GILES,"<br>  It doesn't matter if you're not physical with each other anymore. There's a   connection. You rely on him, he relies on you. That's what's affecting your   judgment."
BUFFY,"<br>  You think I'm losing sight of the big picture, but I'm not. When Spike had that   chip, it was like having him in a muzzle. It was wrong. You can't beat evil   by doing evil. I know that. (walks out of the room)"

XANDER,"<br>  Hi, can I help? You seem kind of confused."
WOMAN,"<br>  (holding a rope, looks at his clothes) You aren't wearing a green apron."
XANDER,"<br>  Confused, but sort of randomly observant."
WOMAN,"<br>  Sorry, I just mean... you don't work here, right?"
XANDER,"<br>  No. Right. Just helpful. I'm Xander."
WOMAN,"<br>  Lissa. (they shake hands) And I guess I could use some advice. I can't even   figure out if I've got the right kind of rope."
XANDER,"<br>  That depends on what you need it for. Something like functional around the house,   or, you know, recreational. (Lissa raises her eyebrows and grins) By which I   mean, for example, boating or mountain climbing&#151;not for tying someone up for   sexy, funky fun. (Lissa giggles) In conclusion, rope can be useful in various   ways."
WOMAN/LISSA,"<br>  I have a kayak."
XANDER,"<br>  Again with the random. I like it."
LISSA,"<br>  Sorry. I need to store my kayak. So I was thinking maybe I could sorta suspend   it from the ceiling in the garage with ropes and a pulley or a winch thing."
XANDER,"<br>  Not a bad plan. You'll need stronger rope than that. Wanna have coffee with   me later?"
LISSA,"<br>  What?"

PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Um, what're you doing tonight?"
BUFFY,"<br>  Preparing for tomorrow's counseling sessions."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  No, really."
BUFFY,"<br>  Watching a reality show about a millionaire."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>    Well, then, I'd, um&#151; I'd like to take you out to dinner, if that's all     right with you. I mean, you don't have to. I'm certainly not saying come to     dinner if you enjoy having a job. (chuckles then realizes what he said) You     know, I may have to make up a document saying I didn't just say that and have     you sign it."

WILLOW,"<br>  (folding socks) So, he asked you out to dinner?"
BUFFY,"<br>  Yeah. Isn't that weird? I mean, he's a Principal. He's a young, hot Principal   with earrings, but he's a Principal. Why do you think he asked me out? I mean,   he could be interested, right?"
WILLOW,"<br>  Yeah, sure. You're a frisky vixen."
BUFFY,"<br>  Or, it could be work-related. Maybe I'm getting promoted for doing such a good   job."
WILLOW,"<br>  (laughs, then notices Buffy's hurt look and gets serious) Oh, right, that&#151;that   makes sense too."
BUFFY,"<br>  Or, maybe he knows that I suspect he's up to something, and he's taking me out   to kill me."
WILLOW,"<br>  (shrugs) Well, you'll have to dress for the ambiguity."
BUFFY,"<br>  You know, it's not even that he's acting that suspicious. It's just&#151;there he   is. On the hell mouth. All day, every day. That's got to be like being showered   with evil. Only from underneath."
WILLOW,"<br>  Not really a shower."
BUFFY,"<br>  A bidet. Like a bidet of evil."
WILLOW,"<br>  Buff, if he's really interested, (smiles) are you interested back?"
BUFFY,"<br>  (blushes) I don't know. He's good-looking, and he's&#151;he's solid, he's smart,   he's normal. So, not the wicked energy, which is nice 'cause I don't want to   only be attracted to wicked energy. Or what if he is wicked, in which case,   is that why I'm attracted to him?"
WILLOW,"<br>  I'm gonna wait for that sentence to come around again before I jump on."
BUFFY,"<br>  (grins) You know what? Yeah, I mean I think I like him. And he'd be good for   me."
WILLOW,"<br>  (nods) Right. Help you move on."
BUFFY,"<br>    (defensively) Why does everybody in this house think I'm still in love with     Spike?"
WILLOW,"<br>  No, I-I meant move on from this imposed super-self-reliance. Let somebody get   close."
BUFFY,"<br>  Oh. (the front door opens) Hey, someone's here."
XANDER,"<br>  (comes in through the front door, giddy) Guys, guess what happened."
WILLOW,"<br>  (grins) Buffy got a date!"
XANDER,"<br>  (excited) No, I did. (looks at Buffy, frowning) Fine. Way to steal my thunder."
BUFFY,"<br>  Sorry. If it makes you feel better, it's Principal Wood, and I think he's aligned   with the First."
XANDER,"<br>  Also, like ten years older than you, right?"
WILLOW,"<br>    (teasing) Which is like 100 years younger than your type!"
BUFFY,"<br>  Yay. Someone who doesn't remember the Industrial Revolution."
WILLOW,"<br>  I think they're gonna end up making out. (mocking, holds a pair of socks to   her chest lovingly) &quot;Oh, Principal Wood,&quot; she'll gasp, &quot;I love   your lack of wicked energy.&quot;"
BUFFY,"<br>  (throws a pair of socks at Willow) Watch it, or I'm gonna make you talk about   your new girlfriend who you hold hands with under the dinner table and think   we don't notice."
WILLOW,"<br>  How 'bout yours, Xander. Is she evil?"
XANDER,"<br>    Well, she's interested in me, so there's a good chance, but I'm hoping for     the best. We're going for coffee. She has a kayak&#151;"
GILES,"<br>    (putting down the shopping bags) Dear lord, I hate that mall. The shop assistants     are rude. And everything in the Food Court is sticky."
WILLOW,"<br>  Looks like you found her some stuff."
GILES,"<br>  Oh, hello. Yes."
XANDER,"<br>  That's gotta be rough. Getting just like pulled out of your home, being told   you're a potential slayer, not being able to bring anything."
GILES,"<br>  Yes, and the language barrier is formidable. I was concerned that my Mandarin   is a little thin, but as it turns out, she speaks Cantonese, which is thinner.   But we muddled through, and, as I suspected, ice cream is a universal language."

BUFFY,"<br>  (smiling, nodding, talking through her closed teeth) What'd she say?"
GILES,"<br>  She's grateful to be in the land of plenty. (to Chao-Ahn, slowly) Let's, um,   go and put away your new clothes. (picks up bags and walks upstairs; Chao-Ahn   nods and follows)"
BUFFY,"<br>  Hey, Will, do you think you can do a computer check on Principal Wood. See if   you can find anything out."
WILLOW,"<br>  Yeah, sure. Want me to check your girl out while I'm at it, Xand?"
XANDER,"<br>  Nope. I'm going in blind. I'm gonna be an optimist about this. Why go looking   for trouble? If it's gonna find you, it's gonna find you."

ANDREW,"<br>  Yeah."

ANDREW,"<br>  That sounds nice."
JONATHAN/FIRST,"<br>  Your assignment won't be hard. They're just little girls."
ANDREW,"<br>  You want me to hurt the girls?"
JONATHAN/FIRST,"<br>  Uh, no, not all of them. Not Dawn, not Anya, not Willow, and not your friend   Buffy. Just the potential slayers."
