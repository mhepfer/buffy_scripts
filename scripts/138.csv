There's a fire in     the fireplace beneath an elaborate mantelpiece, over which hangs an anime     poster and tribal masks.

ANDREW,"<br>    The world's gonna want to know about Buffy. It's a story of ultimate triumph     tainted with the bitterness for what's been lost in the struggle. It's a legacy     for future generations."
ANYA,"<br>    If there are any. Buffy seems to think that this apocalypse is going to actually     be, you know, apocalyptic. I think your&#151;your story seems pretty pointless."
ANDREW,"<br>    Oh, (looks away) I was gonna interview you later today, (stands close to Anya,     looking in her eyes) 'cause, you know, your whole perspective on the whole     thing. Give it editorial balance and, uh, (cocks his head to the side, looks     at her) glamour..."

ANDREW,"<br>    Let's explore the world of our story, shall we? This&#151;uh, Buffy lives     in Sunnydale, California. (moves to the side so the whole board can be seen,     uses the remote to zoom the camera in as he points to the building with a     marker) Um, this is the local high school."
ANDREW,"<br>    There's a hellmouth&#151;hellmouth&#151;underneath the high school. See, weird     things happen on the hellmouth (zoom out) that attracts all sorts of, uh,     bad people and demons and vampires. And now there's this thing in the basement     of the high school called the-the seal of Danzal&#151;Danzalthar, and it's     sort of a door to the hellmouth. (stands in front of the board, nervously)     Uh, due to some circumstances it got opened up... a little bit... recently...uh,     and this, uh, nasty, nasty vampire thing came out of it. It was, uh, it was     just awful, awful. This whole thing&#151; (gestures in a circle with the marker)     whole thing&#151;is being orchestrated by something called &quot;The First&quot;.     It's made up of all the evil in the whole world. Oh, there's also these guys.     (points to the harbingers) They work for the First. We don't know much about     them except that they're very ugly and they're very mobile for blind people.     Is that all clear?"

ANDREW,"<br>    It's morning in Sunnydale, and the women of command central take the time     to fortify themselves for the day ahead. (Kennedy and Willow pours themselves     each a bowl of cereal)"
XANDER,"<br>    (eating cereal from the box, scowls at Andrew) Hey!"
ANDREW,"<br>    Women and Xander. (puts the camera down for a moment) Hey, I'm gonna do your     special intro later. &quot;The man who is the heart of the slayer machine.&quot;"
XANDER,"<br>    (smiles) Yeah? The heart? (blushes)"
ANDREW,"<br>    (recording again, walks around the room) Things are tense in command central     this morning. Buffy is clearly concerned with some unknown danger, and the     air is filled with foreboding."
DAWN,"<br>    (drying dishes) Oh, um, we're out of Raisin Bran."
ANYA,"<br>    I'll put it on the list."
ANDREW,"<br>    That's probably not the unknown danger."
SPIKE,"<br>    (walks into the kitchen) Look at this place. Damn girls' dorm is what it is.     (lights up a cigarette)"
DAWN,"<br>    That's nice. Second-hand stinkiness."
ANDREW,"<br>    Full house. I think it's a good time to do some introductions, don't you,     gentle viewers?"
AMANDA,"<br>    (standing in front of Andrew, she waves and talks into the camera) I'm Amanda,     and I grew up right here&#151;"
ANDREW,"<br>    (looks up from the camera) Not you, sweetheart. (mouths &quot;sorry&quot;     to Amanda) Let's start from the top."
ANDREW (V.O.),"<br>    You've already met Buffy. (Buffy gracefully pours herself a bowl of cereal,     and shakes her hair sexily in the breeze that comes from nowhere, and looks     directly into the camera) She's beautiful, with a lion's heart and&#151; (Buffy     winks) and the face of an Angel. She's never afraid 'cause she knows her side     will always win. (a shirtless Spike enters view, walking up to Buffy; they     look as if they will kiss, but don't; instead, he touches her waist, and Buffy     touches his arms as they nearly embrace) Buffy and Spike have some kind of     history&#151;you can feel the heat between them. Although, technically, as     a vampire, he's room temperature. (flits sexily into view, crossing in front     of Spike and Buffy, twirling and eating from a bunch of grapes, then smiling     into the camera) Anya, a feisty waif with a firey temper and a vulnerable     heart that she hides, even from herself. (camera pans over to a blonde girl     eating from a bowl of cereal) This lovely girl&#151;I don't remember her name&#151;"
BUFFY,"<br>    (to Xander) Oh, for God's sake. Is he doing that again? Can't we make him     stop?"
RONA,"<br>    I don't know, if we save the world, it will be kind of nice to have a record     of it. (Buffy rolls her eyes)"
AMANDA,"<br>    If we don't save the world, then... nothing matters."
KENNEDY,"<br>    (pauses in her breakfast, spoon still in hand) That's catchy, Amanda. Let's     make that our slogan."
XANDER,"<br>    Yeah, it is kinda strange, how you keep saving the world, and there's not     any proof."
ANYA,"<br>    Yeah, you know, for future generations."
WILLOW,"<br>    And it does help the girls with training&#151;you know, viewing the tapes."
BUFFY,"<br>    Come on. No one else thinks this is idiotic?"
XANDER,"<br>    Or is it important? I mean, Buff, I don't get why this is bothering you so     much."
BUFFY,"<br>    Because it's a waste of time. Come on, someone has to agree with me. Spike?"
SPIKE,"<br>    Long as you're not pointing that thing at me, seems like a fine way to keep     the boy busy."
BUFFY,"<br>    This isn't about keeping busy. This is about war. I'm sorry to jump all over     you guys, but... I have to tell you what's really going on. There's something     new. (Andrew walks around behind Buffy) Amanda, Dawn&#151;you're gonna stay     home from school today. We can survive what's coming, but not like this.

ANDREW,"<br>    Honestly, gentle viewers, these motivating speeches of hers tend to get a     little long. I'll take you back in there in&#151;in a little while, but in     the in-between time, I thought you might want to know a little about me, your     humble host. You see, I am a man with a burden.

Willow and Kennedy     have been in kind of a bad place lately, but things are looking up.

ANDREW,"<br>    (narrating) She's like a woman fighting for more than life. She fights like     fighting is her life. It's like the air she breathes, and she knows she will     win because there is no alternative."
BUFFY,"<br>    (knocks out the last Bringer) It's your turn, Andrew. (pulls out the knife,     and walks toward Andrew)"
ANDREW,"<br>    (walks away from Buffy, around the seal) So, you figure, what? I, uh... (puts     down the camcorder) I stand on the seal, and hold the knife, and command it     to stop glowing in Tawarick?"
BUFFY,"<br>    Or we could do this?"
ANDREW,"<br>    What?"
BUFFY,"<br>    Doesn't really make sense, does it? Bringing you here to talk to it. This     thing doesn't understand words, it understands blood."
ANDREW,"<br>    (nervous) Blood opens it. You don't want to open it. Opening it would be bad."
BUFFY,"<br>    (flips the knife) Yeah, Willow did a little research. Turns out, the blood     of the person that awoke it&#151;you&#151;different kind of deal. It reverses     the whole thing."
ANDREW,"<br>    So, how much blood...are you gonna&#151;"
BUFFY,"<br>    I don't know. Maybe not enough to kill you."
ANDREW,"<br>    (faces her, but still backs away) So, this is my redemption at last? I buy     back my bruised soul with the blood of my heart. But-but not enough to kill&#151;"
BUFFY,"<br>    (standing right in front of him now, pointing the knife at him) Stop! Stop     telling stories. Life isn't a story."
ANDREW,"<br>    (frightened) Sorry. Sorry."
BUFFY,"<br>    Shut up. You always do this. You make everything into a story so no one's     responsible for anything because they're just following a script."
ANDREW,"<br>    Please don't kill me. Warren said Jonathan would be OK. I trusted him, and     I lost my friend."
BUFFY,"<br>    (angrily) You didn't lose him. You murdered him."
ANDREW,"<br>    (softly, sincerely) I know, but you don't need to kill me. You said we could     all get through this."
BUFFY,"<br>    I made it up. I'm making it all up. What kind of hero does that make me?"
ANDREW,"<br>    (shakes his head) No, you're doing great. Really. Kudos."
BUFFY,"<br>    Yeah? Well, I don't like having to give a bunch of speeches about how we're     all gonna live, because we won't. This isn't some story where good triumphs     because good triumphs. Good people are going to die! Girls. Maybe me. Probably     you. Probably right now."
ANDREW,"<br>    (shakes his head, frightened) Don't! Please! Don't, please!"
BUFFY,"<br>    When your blood pours out, it might save the world. What do you think about     that? Does it buy it all back? Are you redeemed?"
ANDREW,"<br>    (crying) No."
BUFFY,"<br>    Why not?"
ANDREW,"<br>    (sobbing, his face is tear-streaked) Because I killed him. Because I listened     to Warren, and I pretended I thought it was him, but I knew&#151;I knew it     wasn't. And I killed Jonathan. And now you're gonna kill me. And I'm scared,     and I'm going to die. And this&#151;this is what Jonathan felt."
ANDREW,"<br>    It stopped."
BUFFY,"<br>    Didn't want blood. It wanted tears."
ANDREW,"<br>    (stands) Thanks."
BUFFY,"<br>    Sorry, I had to&#151;"
ANDREW,"<br>    You&#151;you weren't really going to stab me, were you?"
BUFFY,"<br>    I wasn't going to stab you."
