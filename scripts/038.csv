character,dialogue
Buffy,"'One night after supper, the lead dog turned up a snowshoe  rabbit. The dog lay down low to the race, his body flashing forward,  leap by leap.'"
Willow,"'He was sounding the deeps of his nature and the parts of his  nature that were deeper than he, going back into the wombs of time. The  rabbit could not...'"
Willow,"Okay. Uh, maybe we should try a less stimulating passage."
Xander,Private Harris reporting for Oz watch.
Willow,"(looks up from the book) Xander! Oh, good."
Xander,Oh! 'Call of the Wild.' Aren't we reading the Cliff Notes to  this for English?
Willow,"Some of us are. (takes back the book) Anyway, it'll help you  stay awake. It's good and, and very wolfy. (looks at Oz) Seems to soothe  the savage beast."
Willow,(quietly) Except for the parts about... (whispers) rabbits.
Xander,(snags the book) Rabbis? (looks it over)
Willow,"(takes the book back again) It... seems to make him a little  overexcited. (puts it on the table) Okay. Now, he's had his 2:00  feeding, and, uh, after sunrise, if he forgets where his clothes are,  they're on top of the file cabinet in his cage. (indicates the cage) I  put those towels up for privacy."
Xander,"Uh, no worries. I can handle the Oz Full Monty. (smirks) I  mean, not 'handle' handle, like 'hands to flesh' handle."
Willow,"(nods) Mm, okay. (with lots of nervous gesturing) Well, it's  not for you. It's for me, 'cause I'm still getting used to half a Monty."
Xander,Oh. Good. (realizes) Half? You and Oz? Which half?
Willow,"(with a big smile) Wouldn't *you* like to know? Anyway, he's  more manageable tonight and on the third night. Tomorrow night, the  total full moon, that's when he's a real wolfer. (reaches across the  table) But in case there's trouble... there won't be, but if..."
Xander,Sleepy time. Gotcha.
Willow,"Thanks again for doing this. I wouldn't have asked, but I have  this test."
Xander,"No big. You can count on me. (looks at his things) I got my  coffee, magazines. Figured I'd read, maybe (points with the gun) run the  stairs over there a little bit. (chuckles) I'm good."
Willow,Bye.
Faith,Nice place. Do you ever catch kids doing the diddy out here?
Buffy,No. There's a smooch spot up by the woods. That's usually where  kids go.
Faith,Yeah? Bet you and Scott have been up there kicking the  gearshift. (grins)
Buffy,(gives her a look) Hardly. Only been on a few dates.
Faith,"But you like him. And when you think about him, you get that  (inhales) good, down-low tickle, right?"
Buffy,"(smiles) Yeah, I guess, but... (realizes what she may have  meant, and gives her the eye) How low?"
Faith,(grins broadly) You tell me.
Buffy,"How about not? (looks around dreamily) But he is... (sighs)  nice, and he's funny."
Faith,And quite a muffin.
Buffy,"Blueberry. That crunchy, munchy stuff on top. But my most  favorite thing so far (sighs) is that he doesn't seem to be any kind of  Hell Beast."
Faith,"All men are beasts, Buffy."
Buffy,"Okay, I was hoping to not get that cynical till I was at least  forty."
Faith,"It's not cynical. I mean, it's realistic. Every guy from...  Manimal down to Mr. I-Love-The-English-Patient has beast in him. And I  don't care how sensitive they act. They're all still just in it for the  chase."
Willow,"I don't think that's true, that every guy is in it only for the  chase."
Buffy,I know. It is an awful generalization.
Scott,Hey Buffy!
Scott,"That's what I stopped you for, basically. Hey."
Buffy,Okay. (smiles) Hey.
Oz,"How do, Debbie?"
Debbie,"Hi, Oz. Hey, you're not doing jazz band this year?"
Oz,"Oh, can't take the pressure. It's not the music that's hard, it's  the marching."
Buffy,We have a marching jazz band? (looks at Scott inquisitively)
Oz,"Yeah, but, you know, since the best jazz is improvisational, we'd  be going off in all directions, banging into floats... Scary."
Willow,(smiles at everyone) He's just being Oz.
Oz,Pretty much full-time. (smiles at Willow)
Buffy,(sees Debbie's bouquet) Those are pretty flowers.
Debbie,Thanks. Pete brought them for me. (smiles at him)
Pete,"(smiles) Yeah. Well, I-I'm sure Scott does that kind of stuff for  you, too, Buffy."
Scott,"Oh, well, we're not up to flowers. (to Buffy) Are we? Up to  flowers? Did I miss flowers?"
Buffy,(reassuringly) No. We're pre-posy. Definitely.
Buffy,"What time is it? (grabs Scott's watch) Oh, I have to go see Mr.  Platt today."
Debbie,Platt? The school counselor?
Buffy,I get to convince him that I'm Little Miss Stable so I can stay  in school.
Debbie,"Platt creeps me out. I would totally quit going, but I'm  flunking senior bio, and my teacher says I have success issues.  (giggles)"
Oz,Senior bio? I kinda aced that final.
Willow,"(needles Oz) And how did you do that? Oh, right. You showed up."
Oz,"(to Debbie) If you want my notes, they're yours."
Debbie,Thanks! That'd be great!
Buffy,We'd better go. (to Scott) I'll see you.
Scott,Yep.
Giles,We need to recheck every possible exit avenue.
Xander,"I'm telling you, it's a waste of time. I was here all night."
Giles,"Right. (smiles stiffly) It's good to see you. Um, no need to  panic."
Oz,Just a thought: poker: not your game.
Willow,"(worried) What's the deal, Giles?"
Giles,"(starts to pace) Now, uh, bear in mind, uh, most likely, there,  there, there is no deal, (stops and looks at Xander) but um, if, if, if  there was a deal, then it, um, would concern murder... last night. A  male student was, was found i-i-in the woods."
Willow,Which student?
Giles,Jeff Orkin.
Oz,Jeff? He was...
Oz,I knew him.
Giles,"I'm afraid he was, he was, um, terribly mauled. Now, uh, much as  I hate to think it, i-i-it could be the handiwork of, of..."
Oz,Me.
Willow,"(very concerned) Wolf you, not you you."
Xander,"But it's not. Not wolf you, not you you. The room was secured,  the gate was locked, (heads into the cage) and the window unbreakable,  and... (looks up at the window) open!"
Willow,"(upset) Oh, God."
Xander,Not to freak. I rested my eyes now and then. That's all.
Giles,(looks down from the window) How long... *exactly* did you...  rest your eyes for? (glares at him)
Xander,"A little now, uh, a little then. But I never heard Oz leave,  and he was here in the morning when I, um... (searches for words) when  I..."
Giles,(angrily) WOKE UP!
Xander,"You could put it that way if you want to, Mr. Technical."
Willow,"Oh, God."
Buffy,"(smiles) Buffy Summers, reporting for sanity."
Buffy,"Look... I know that I have to do this, and I-I'll cooperate, and  I'll look at your ink blots and everything, but... I don't wanna talk  about my life or my childhood or... anything, for that matter, actually.  And, uh... I don't wanna be friends here."
Buffy,Not too crazy? Those are your credentials?
Buffy,(averts her eyes) Gotta say I'm with you on that. (looks down at  her hands)
Buffy,(smiles weakly) That's a long story.
Buffy,"You know, I'm, I'm really over it. I-I'm moving on, I feel good,  I'm, I'm even dating someone new."
Buffy,"(awkwardly) I was dating someone. Uh, it-it ended badly. My mom  and I were fighting, and I... kinda freaked."
Buffy,"He was my first... I loved him, and then he..."
Buffy,Yeah.
Buffy,Yes.
Buffy,(considers) And if you can't?
Buffy,I'm afraid to ask. (crosses her arms)
Cordelia,Oz ate someone last night.
Willow,(glares) He did not!
Xander,"(annoyed) Oz does not eat people. (Cordelia rolls her eyes)  It's more werewolf play. (Buffy looks at Giles inquiringly) You know, I  bat you around a little bit, like a cat toy. I have harmless, wolf fun.  Is it Oz's fault that, (Oz lowers his head) you know, side effect,  people get cut to ribbons, and maybe then he'll take a little nibble  and... (Willow gives him a hurt look) I'm not helping, am I?"
Giles,No. Oz may have got out of his cage last night.
Oz,"Or maybe there's a, another werewolf roaming the woods."
Giles,Perhaps. Perhaps it's something else entirely.
Buffy,"It's okay. We'll work together, and we'll figure this out."
Giles,"Yes. Um... (thinks) Buffy. Uh, you, uh, you patrol the woods.  Uh, the others, um, check out the morgue."
Willow,(hopeful) Right! We can see if it's a werewolf kill or not.  (glances at Oz next to her) But what about Oz?
Giles,"Um... Well, I have some research materials at home I need to  look up. Uh... W-w-we could ask Faith to watch over him."
Oz,"What, you're having a Slayer watch me? Oh, good, we're not  overreacting."
Oz,"Okay. Uh, you know that thing where you bail in the middle of an  upsetting conversation? (inhales) I have to do that. (exhales) It's  kinda dramatic, I know, but... sometimes, it's a necessary guy thing."
Willow,"And I want you to... do the guy thing, but..."
Willow,Oz?
Oz,(unwilling to look at her) Get away from the cage.
Willow,(confused by his tone of voice) What?
Oz,(still not looking at her) It's gonna happen soon.
Oz,Get away from me.
Xander,"Oh, God."
Willow,Here. Hold this.
Xander,Aah!
Cordelia,God!
Xander,(to Cordelia) We're doing crime here. You don't sneak up during  crime.
Cordelia,"God, have a... (gets a look at Jeff's mauled body) Okay!  (covers her face) Scarred for life! Oh, God!"
Cordelia,"Willow, how can you stand it?"
Xander,"Yeah, Will. I mean, this guy *is* pretty barf-worthy. Can't we  be elsewhere? Like, you know, is Oz cleared or what, huh?"
Willow,"I'm not sure. I mean, there are a lot of incised wounds, but  they could be from anything."
Cordelia,"Anything with big, sharp teeth and vicious..."
Xander,(interrupts) Do you wanna go back to the car and wait?
Cordelia,"(stares, taken aback) No. God. I'm just saying..."
Willow,Almost done. Lemme just get a few stray hairs from the body.  They could be from the attacker.
Xander,Great. So we got everything we need?
Willow,Yep. That's it.
Cordelia,Oh!
Xander,Okay. Uh... little too much excitement for the Wilster here.
Xander,"Doesn't look good for Oz, does it?"
Cordelia,It really doesn't. (they look up at Jeff) This guy was ripped  apart by a big wild animal.
Buffy,Oh!
Faith,"Oh! Uh, Buffy! Are you okay? What are you doing here?"
Buffy,"(holds her jaw) Uh, bleeding internally, but I'll live."
Faith,"God, I'm sorry. (shrugs with the CD player) I guess I didn't  hear you."
Buffy,"Figured as much. Ow. Again. (takes a breath and arches her back)  Uh... Actually, I-I-I came to give you the rest of the night off."
Faith,"Get out of jail free, huh? How come?"
Buffy,"(shrugs) Couldn't sleep. (takes off her jacket) Figured I'd, uh,  cram for my French test."
Faith,"That's cool. I was going kinda crazy in here, but I can get in a  few stakings before sunrise."
Buffy,"Knock yourself out. Not literally, though."
Faith,Yeah. Later.
Buffy,Hey.
Giles,Hmm. Hello. (sips his coffee)
Buffy,Oh. Boy. (stands up) Faith and her nutty books.
Giles,(reads some book titles) 'Exploring Demon Dimensions' and  'Mystery of Acathla'.
Buffy,Yeah! And she still listens to heavy metal. (walks toward the  stairs) Freaky deaky.
Giles,Buffy...
Buffy,"What if... I told you that... I had a dream about Angel... and,  um... it brought up some questions?"
Giles,I'd say it was to be expected. Must have been some dream. I  didn't think you knew what a card index was for. (sips his coffee)
Buffy,I dreamt that he came back.
Giles,"Of course. After Jenny was killed, (sets the cup aside) I had  dreams that she was s-still alive, that I saved her."
Buffy,"This was vivid. Really vivid. Three-dimensional, sensurround,  the hills are alive..."
Giles,Do you believe it was a prophecy?
Buffy,No. I-I don't know. I... (inhales deeply) I guess it just... it  made me wonder.
Buffy,Is there a chance even? Could it happen?
Giles,"Well, there's no record of anyone returning from a demon  dimension once the... gate was closed. I-I-I can't imagine how it could  happen or-or why."
Buffy,Let's just pretend for a second that... Angel somehow found his  way back to Sunnydale. What would he be like?
Giles,"I really can't say. From what is known about that dimension, i- it would suggest a world of... brutal torment. And time moves quite  differently there, so..."
Buffy,I remember. So he would've been down there for hundreds of  years.
Giles,Yes. (looks up at her)
Buffy,Of torture.
Giles,"It would take someone of extraordinary... will and character to  survive that and, uh, retain any semblance of self. (swallows hard) Most  likely, he'd be, be a monster."
Buffy,(hopelessly) A lost cause.
Giles,"Maybe. Maybe not. In my experience, there are... two types of  monster. The first, uh, can be redeemed, or more importantly, wants to  be redeemed."
Buffy,And the second type?
Giles,"The second is void of humanity, cannot respond to reason... or  love."
Willow,I thought Faith was on duty.
Buffy,"Oh, hey. Change of plans. (comes down to her)"
Willow,"Glazed or cake? (smiles) It's fun to watch them make them.  (gestures) They use this spritzy thing, and they drop the batter into  this..."
Buffy,"Couldn't sleep, huh?"
Willow,(sighs) I've been at Mister Donut since the TV did that snowy  thing.
Willow,"How come *you're* the Wakey Girl? I mean, this time, it's not  your boyfriend who's the cold-blooded..."
Willow,Jelly doughnut? (offers the box)
Oz,(ignores the donuts) Everything all right?
Buffy,"Yeah. Uh, what happened with the inspection of the body?"
Willow,"(smiles, avoiding the issue) Anyone? They're yummy delicious!"
Buffy,"Willow, come on. Was it werewolf?"
Buffy,Was it a vampire?
Willow,I-it wasn't conclusive.
Buffy,How could it not be conclusive? What did it look like? Was he  bit?
Giles,"Let her finish, Buffy."
Buffy,"(looks back at him) No, it's just..."
Buffy,I'm sorry.
Scott,Buffy. Over here.
Buffy,Hey.
Scott,"Hey. Uh... I can't, I can't back you on that lunch. Nutritional  demerits."
Buffy,Oh. My stomach doesn't want hard food today. (points at the  green Jell-O) But there's fruit in it.
Scott,(whispers) Those are marshmallows.
Buffy,(looks at it) Oh.
Buffy,I'm... I'm really out of it today. I didn't sleep well last  night.
Debbie,Just don't tell Mr. Platt you have insomnia. He'll make you  start a dream journal.
Pete,"Oh, what's that, like, a Barbie thing? Dear Dream Journal, how  come Ken hasn't come around since he got that earring?"
Debbie,(giggles) I never did it. He's a quack.
Buffy,I kinda liked him.
Debbie,"Really? I guess, I guess he's kinda funny and stuff. It's  just... sometimes I just don't like the things he says."
Buffy,"Oh, he definitely... marches to the beat of his own drummer. A- actually, I think he makes his own drums."
Scott,"Well, my mom says that therapy can be completely helpful."
Pete,"Yeah, but your mom has the wattage of a Zippo lighter, Scott."
Scott,"(to Buffy) I hope you realize I don't actually know these  people. I just... I thought you would like me better if I had friends,  so I hired them."
Scott,"So... I, uh, I wanted to tell you that you look great today. But  now I wanna raise that to amazing because you didn't sleep well."
Buffy,"Uh... (smiles) That's really sweet. Um... And I-I wish I didn't  have to, (stands up) but I just remembered that I do, so, uh, I'll see  you later."
Scott,"Uh, yeah."
Pete,Check out Scotty liking the manic-depressive chick.
Buffy,Angel?
Buffy,Do you understand me?
Pete,"Debbie, come on. Just for a minute."
Debbie,"No, I can't. I have to meet a friend."
Pete,So you'll be late but happy.
Debbie,"No, no. Let's stay here."
Pete,"Relax, Debbie. What's wrong with you today?"
Pete,What is that?
Debbie,(giggles) Nothing. Kiss me. (kisses him)
Pete,"No. Debbie, you did not drink that, did you?"
Debbie,(looks at the jar) Drink it? (giggles) You know I didn't.
Pete,"(looks intensely at her) Debbie, what's going on?"
Buffy,"Two o'clock. Buffy Summers, right?"
Buffy,"Wait. Don't turn around. (realizes her useless gesture) Okay?  And don't say anything. (clutches her jacket) Just listen. (begins to  pace and breathe nervously) I mean, that's, that's your thing, right?"
Buffy,"There's something going on. (her voice shakes) I mean, th-this  whole entire story is probably gonna convince you that I'm loony-bin  material, but... (shrugs) there's nobody else that I can talk to.  (inhales nervously) Not Willow and... not Giles. Nobody. (starts to pace  again) If they, if they found out, they'd freak on me or they'd do  something, and... (stops and faces him) I need help. I just, I need to  talk to someone. (takes a few breaths) I'm so scared. (sheds a tear)  It's this guy. (steps up to the desk) H-h-he..."
Buffy,He's come back.
Pete,So the bottle just (faces Debbie) jumped out of the cabinet and  spilled on its own.
Debbie,(shakes her head) Of course not. I-I was trying to get rid of  it.
Pete,You were trying to get rid of it?
Debbie,To help you. You know how you get.
Pete,(exhales) You think this has (clenches his fist) *anything* to do  with how I get?
Debbie,"Well, when you drink it..."
Pete,"When I drink it, nothing, Debbie. Nothing! (Debbie flinches) I  don't need this anymore, okay? I am way, *way* past that now."
Pete,You see?
Pete,"You see?! (breaks another) No more. (breaks a third) You could  pour out everything I made, and it wouldn't help. And you wanna know  why?"
Pete,"You wanna know why?! Because all it takes now is you, Debbie.  (grits his teeth) You and your STUPID, GRATING VOICE!"
Pete,(angrily) *You're* the reason I started the formulas in the first  place: to be the man you wanted! And you pay me back how? (Debbie sobs  in fear) By whoring around with other guys and taunting me!
Debbie,No! I don't! I don't even look!
Pete,"Is that something your shrink taught you, Debbie? Huh? Huh? To  share? (approaches her) To communicate? To piss me off?!"
Pete,"Well, guess what? Even *he's* not going to listen to your  pathetic ramblings anymore. (she looks up at him frightened) I'm all  you've got now, Debbie! Do you hear me? (points at her) I AM ALL YOU'VE  GOT!"
Pete,"Oh, my God."
Pete,"(whispering) Hey, Debbie. (she turns away) Hey, listen. (quietly)  You know you shouldn't make me mad. Huh? You know what happens."
Pete,"Debbie, please. Are you all right?"
Debbie,It's okay.
Debbie,It's okay.
Giles,This creature is especially brutal. I believe the phrase coined  by the coroner when describing Mr. Platt was 'pureed'. But he did  confirm that Platt was killed shortly before Buffy found him.
Faith,Which means that he was killed during the day.
Willow,(elated) Yes! (raises her fist)
Willow,"Sorry. I got... (lowers her hand) I've just been... it's  horrible, horrible. (swallows)"
Buffy,"It's okay, Will. We're all glad Oz is off the hook."
Giles,Indeed. (checks his watch) Shouldn't he be here by now? The sun  sets at 5:30.
Debbie,Sorry I'm late. (smiles) Did you bring the notes?
Oz,(notices her black eye) Yeah. Um... You okay? (hands her the notes)
Debbie,"What? Oh, yeah! (laughs) I'm such a klutz! I, um, oh..."
Oz,Fell down? Hit your... eye?
Debbie,Doorknob. (laughs) Um... Thanks. (starts to go)
Oz,"(stops her with his hand) Hey, um... (concerned) If you wanna  talk..."
Debbie,(shakes her head and smiles) Thanks again for the notes.  (leaves)
Oz,Yeah...
Giles,"Our task now is to determine what sort of killer we *are*  dealing with. Clearly, we're looking for a depraved, sadistic animal."
Oz,(comes in) Present.
Oz,"Hey, I may be a cold-blooded jelly doughnut, but my timing is  impeccable."
Willow,"(touches him with both hands, smiling) But you aren't! I-i- it's-it's a kill-in-the-day monster! A hundred percent for sure."
Oz,(very relieved) Okay. (smiles)
Giles,"Uh, I wish we had time to celebrate properly. However, we have  two victims: Jeff Orkin and, uh, now Platt. Uh, maybe there's something  they had in common."
Faith,Missing internal organs.
Giles,Besides that.
Oz,"Debbie. (Giles looks at him) Well, victim number one, Jeff. He was  in jazz band with us. They used to horse around."
Faith,They were screwing?
Oz,"I don't think so, but he hid her music comp book once."
Buffy,"And we know that Debbie knew Platt. I mean, she was seeing him  and way vocal about not having love for the guy."
Oz,Add this and stir. I just saw Debbie a minute ago sporting a nasty  black eye.
Willow,"Okay, so pretend Debbie wanted Platt dead. Maybe he fought  back."
Buffy,"(shakes her head) No. Platt was dead in an instant. (exhales) He  didn't even drop his cigarette. (has a thought) Now, what if boyfriend  Pete's the one doling out the punishment?"
Giles,We should find them both immediately.
Oz,"Well, Debbie was in the quad a minute ago."
Giles,"All right. We'll split up. Um, Faith, you and I team. Willow,  stick with Buffy."
Oz,And I'll... go lock myself in the cage.
Buffy,"It's tricky, covering a fresh shiner like that. You know what  works?"
Debbie,What? (puts away her makeup)
Buffy,Don't get hit.
Buffy,"What's going on, Debbie? I'll bet the farm you know."
Debbie,(shakes her head) You're wrong. I don't know anything.
Buffy,"Normally, I'd say, you wanna play 'I have a secret'? Fine. But  people are dying here."
Debbie,"It... it's not his fault. I mean, he's not himself when he gets  like this."
Buffy,You mean Pete.
Debbie,(upset) It's me. I make him crazy. He-he just does what he does  because he loves me too much.
Willow,But weren't Mr. Platt and Jeff murdered by an animal?
Buffy,"Pete's not like other guys, is he, Debbie?"
Debbie,I-I've gotta go.
Buffy,You have to talk to us. (Debbie shakes her head) We can't help  you until you do.
Debbie,I didn't ask for your help!
Willow,"Well, when are you going to? I mean, if Pete kills you, it'll  pretty much be too late."
Buffy,"Debbie, we're running out of time."
Buffy,Where can we find him?
Debbie,I-I don't know.
Buffy,You're lying.
Debbie,What if I am? What are you gonna do about it?
Willow,Wrong question.
Buffy,Look at yourself. Why are you protecting him? Anybody who really  loved you couldn't do this to you.
Debbie,Would they take him someplace?
Buffy,Probably.
Debbie,"(shakes her head, sobbing) I could never do that to him.  (Willow sighs) I'm his everything."
Buffy,"(disgusted) Great. So what, you two live out your Grimm fairy  tale? Two people are dead."
Buffy,Who's gonna be next?
Pete,(angry) Since when do you touch my girl? (grabs the cage)
Oz,"Hey, Pete. This is kind of a bad time."
Pete,"Well, I guess you didn't think about that when you put the moves  on Debbie! (rattles the door)"
Oz,"We talked, yeah, but it was move-free."
Oz,About this cage? When that sun sets...
Pete,(whispers threateningly) You won't be alive to see it!
Oz,I'm serious. Something's gonna happen that you... probably won't  believe.
Oz,Or you might.
Debbie,He does love me. He does love me.
Buffy,This is useless. (exhales) We have to go. I have to find Pete.
Debbie,He does love me.
Willow,Come on.
Debbie,(resists) He does love me.
Willow,I think we broke her.
Debbie,He does love me. He does love me.
Buffy,(stops at the door) I think she was broken before this. (leaves)
Pete,(very angrily) Did you kiss that whore? Huh? Did she like it?
Oz,Time's up. Rules change.
Giles,What was that?
Giles,Get the dart gun!
Buffy,Got it!
Debbie,"Pete, watch out!"
Giles,Ow!
Buffy,Oh! Sorry!
Giles,"Oh, right. Bloody priceless."
Buffy,You get the wolf!
Faith,Got it!
Debbie,"Pete! You're all right! God, you're all right."
Debbie,She almost shot you. Did you see? I stopped her.
Debbie,"You have to leave, get out of Sunnydale. She knows."
Pete,"How did she know, Debbie? Did you run your big mouth?"
Debbie,(frightened) No! She just knew. It seemed like she just knew.
Pete,So you filled in the blanks!
Debbie,(screams) NO! (looks up at him) No!
Pete,But what did I expect from a screw-up like you?
Debbie,(Shakes her head) I-I didn't... Pete...
Pete,You're nothing but a waste of space.
Debbie,No!
Buffy,"Oh, God."
Faith,Where's the gun? (screams) WHERE'S THE GUN?!
Willow,Get off her!
Willow,Get the gun! Get the gun!
Willow,Hurry!
Pete,All the same! (punches again) You're all the same!
Angel,Buffy?
Angel,Buffy...
Willow,"It's all over school, what happened with Debbie and Pete.  Except for the Pete-was-a-monster part."
Oz,Yeah. A freshman told me that Pete had eight iced cafe' mochas and  just lost it.
Buffy,That's better than the estrogen theory. I heard he took all of  his mother's birth control pills.
Cordelia,He didn't? (to Xander) Pete was a monster? (Xander nods)  Where have I been?
Xander,"In your special place, Cor, which is why I adore you."
Cordelia,"So, what's the true story? What happened?"
Willow,"Well, we got ahold of, uh, Pete's lab books and stuff, and Mr.  Science was doing a Jekyll/Hyde deal. He was afraid Debbie was gonna  leave him, so he mixed this potion to become super mas macho."
Buffy,"The only thing was, after a while, he didn't need the potion to  turn into a bad guy. He did it just fine on his own."
Cordelia,So it was like a real killing. He wasn't under the influence  of anything?
Buffy,Just himself.
Buffy,Uh... (to the group) I'll see you guys later. (walks off)
Cordelia,Great. Now I'm gonna be stuck with serious thoughts all day.
Buffy,I don't know what to say that's (inhales) not gonna sound stupid  or obvious.
Scott,I've been friends with them both since before we started school.
Buffy,Is there anything I can do?
Scott,"Thanks. I'm gonna be okay. It's just that you never really know  what's going on inside somebody. Do you? I mean, you think... if you  care about them... But you never really do."
Buffy,"'Night came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees...'"
Buffy,'...lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And the  strain of the primitive remained alive and active.'
Buffy,"'Faithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof were  his...'"
Buffy,'...yet he retained his wildness and wiliness.'
Buffy,"'And from the depths of the forest, a call still sounded.'"
