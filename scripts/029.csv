Lyrics,"<I>I'm not losing yet / So don't forget me / I'll say it, replay  it...</I>"
Angelus,Passion.
Lyrics,<I>...and try tomorrow</I>
Angelus,It lies in all of us.

Angelus,Sleeping...
Lyrics,<I>...and live with sorrow</I>
Angelus,...waiting... And though unwanted...
Lyrics,<I>You'd think I'd learn by now</I>
Angelus,...unbidden... it will stir...

Lyrics,<I>You'd think I'd learn by now / There's never an easy way</I>
Lyrics,<I>I'll get through somehow...</I>
Angelus,It speaks to us... guides us... Passion rules us all. And we  obey. What other choice do we have?
Buffy,He was in my room.
Giles,Who?
Buffy,Angel. He was in my room last night.
Giles,Are you sure?
Buffy,"Positive. When I woke up, I found a picture he'd left me on my  pillow. (crosses her arms)"
Xander,A visit from the pointed-tooth fairy.
Cordelia,"Wait, I thought vampires couldn't come in unless you invited  them in."
Giles,"Yes, but, uh, once you've invited them in, thereafter they're,  they're always welcome."
Xander,"Y'know, I think there may be a valuable lesson for you gals  here about inviting strange men into your bedrooms."
Cordelia,"(realizes) Oh, God! (looks at Xander) I invited him in my car  once. (looks at Giles) That means he can come into my car whenever he  wants."
Xander,"Yep, you're doomed to havin' (Cordelia looks at him) to give  him and his vamp pals a lift whenever they feel like it. And those guys  never chip in for gas."
Buffy,"Giles, there has to be some sort of spell to reverse the  invitation, right? Like a barrier, a no shoes, no pulse, no service kind  of thing?"
Cordelia,"Yeah, that works for a car, too?"
Giles,"Yes, well, I-I-I could check on my..."
Xander,(hops up from his chair) Hello!
Xander,"Excuse me, but have you ever heard of knocking?"
Jonathon,(gestures to the library before him) We're supposed to get  some books. On Stalin. (nods)
Xander,(points at Jonathon) Does this look like a Barnes & Noble?
Giles,"This is a school library, Xander."
Xander,Since when?
Giles,"(to Jonathon) Uh, y-yes, yes, uh, third row. (gestures to the  stacks) Historical biographies."
Jonathon,Thanks.
Giles,What... (gets a look from Buffy) Oh!
Jonathon,"Hey, did you say that was the... (sees they're gone) Hello?"
Giles,So Angel has decided to step up his harassment of you?
Cordelia,By sneaking in her room and leaving stuff at night? Why  doesn't he just slit her throat or strangle her while she's sleeping or  cut her heart out? (gets looks from everyone) What? I'm trying to help.
Giles,"Yes. (to Buffy) Uh, uh, look, it's-it's classic battle strategy  to throw one's opponent off his game. He-he-he's just trying to provoke  you. Uh, to taunt you, to, to goad you into, uh, some mishap of some  sort."
Xander,(looks back at Giles) The (sing-song) nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah  approach to battle?
Giles,"Yes, Xander, once more you've managed to boil a complex thought  down to its simplest possible form. (Xander smiles)"
Buffy,"Giles, Angel once told me that when he was obsessed with  Drusilla, the first thing h-he did was to kill her family."
Xander,(stops and looks at her) Your mom.
Buffy,I know. I'm gonna have to tell her something. (sits on a wall  and looks at Giles) The truth?
Giles,"(approaches her, waving his finger) No. You-you-you-you can't do  that."
Xander,"Yeah. The more people who know the secret, the more it cheapens  it for the rest of us."
Buffy,"But I've gotta tell her something. I've gotta do something.  Giles, Angel has an all-access pass to my house, and I'm not always  there when my mother is. I can't protect her."
Giles,(flustered) I told you I will find a-a spell.
Buffy,What about *until* you find a spell?
Cordelia,"Until then, you and your mother are welcome to ride around  with me in my car."
Giles,"Buffy, I-I understand your concern, but it's imperative that you  keep a level head through all this."
Buffy,That's easy for you to say. You don't have Angel lurking in your  bedroom at night.
Giles,"I know how hard this is for you. (gets a look from Buffy) All  right, I don't. But as the Slayer, you don't have the luxury of being a  slave to your, your passions. You mustn't let Angel get to you. No  matter how provocative his behavior may become."
Buffy,"So what you're basically saying is, 'just ignore him, and maybe  he'll go away'?"
Giles,(exhales) Yes. Precisely.
Xander,"Hey, how come Buffy doesn't get a snotty 'once again you boil  it down to the simplest form' thing?"
Xander,Watcher's pet.
Jenny,"Don't forget, I need your sample spreadsheets by the end of the  week."
Jenny,"Oh, and I want both a paper printout and a copy on disk. Thank  you."
Jenny,Willow.
Willow,(approaches the desk) Yes?
Jenny,"Um, I might be a little late tomorrow. Do you think you could  cover my class till I show?"
Willow,(smiling brightly) Really? Me? Teach the class? Sure!
Jenny,Cool.
Willow,"(suddenly worried) Oh, wait. W-what if they don't recognize my  authority? What if they try to convince me that you always let them  leave class early? What if there's a fire drill? What if there's a fire?"
Jenny,"(reassuringly) Willow, you're gonna be fine. And I'll try not to  be too late, okay?"
Willow,(calmer) Okay. Good. Earlier is good. (smiles) Will I have the  power to assign detention? Or make 'em run laps?
Buffy,"Hey, Will."
Jenny,"Hi, Buffy. Rupert."
Buffy,"(ignoring Jenny) Willow, I thought I might take in a class.  Figured I could use someone who knows where they are."
Willow,"(to Buffy) Sorry. I have to talk to her. She's a teacher, and  teachers are to be respected, (they exit the room) even if they're only  filling in until the real teacher shows up, because otherwise chaos  could ensue..."
Jenny,How have you been?
Giles,"Uh, not so good, actually. Uh, since Angel lost his soul, he's  regained his sense of whimsy."
Jenny,"Well, that sounds bad. (crosses her arms)"
Giles,"He's been in Buffy's bedroom. I-I-I need to drum up a spell to,  uh, keep him out of the house."
Jenny,This might help. (hands it to Giles) I've been doing a little  reading since Angel changed. (crosses her arms again) I don't think you  have that one.
Giles,Thank you. (leafs through it)
Jenny,"So, how's Buffy doing?"
Giles,(closes and lowers the book) How do you think?
Jenny,(faces away) I know you feel betrayed.
Giles,"Yes. Well, that's one of the unpleasant side effects of  betrayal."
Jenny,"(looks down at her desk) Rupert... I was raised by the people  that Angel hurt the most. (looks up at Giles) My duty to them was the  first thing I was ever taught. I didn't come here to hurt anyone, (looks  away) a-and I lied to you because I thought it was the right thing to  do. I... I didn't know what would happen. I didn't know I was gonna fall  in love with you."
Jenny,"Oh, God. Is it too late to take that back?"
Giles,Do you want to?
Jenny,(looks at him) I just wanna be right with you. I don't expect  more. I just want so badly to make all this up to you.
Giles,I understand. But I'm not the one you need to make it up to.
Giles,Thank you for the book.
Joyce,Okay. What's wrong?
Buffy,(looks at her mom) It's nothing. (looks at her plate)
Joyce,Come on. You can tell me anything. (Buffy eyes her) I've read  all the parenting books. You cannot surprise me.
Buffy,Do you remember that guy Angel?
Joyce,"Angel, the, um... (thinks) the college boy who was tutoring you  in history?"
Buffy,"Right. Uh, he... I-I... (looks down and whispers) Oh, God. Um...  (looks back up) We're sort of dating, *were* dating, um, going through a  serious off-again phase right now."
Joyce,(smiles) Don't tell me. He's changed. He's not the same guy you  fell for?
Buffy,"(smiles nervously) In a nutshell. (loses the smile) A-anyway,  um... since he changed, he's been kinda following me around. He's having  trouble letting go."
Joyce,"(concerned) Buffy, has he done anything..."
Buffy,"No! No, it's not like that. He's just been hanging around... a  lot. Just sending me notes, that kind of thing. (gets a concerned look  from Joyce) I just don't wanna see him right now. I mean, if he shows  up, I'll talk to him. Just... don't invite him in."
Willow,"I agree with Giles. You need to just try and not let him get to  you. (heads for her desk) Angel's only doing this to try to get you to  do something stupid. (closes her laptop) I swear, men can be such jerks  sometimes. Dead or alive. (goes to her new aquarium)"
Buffy,I just hope Giles can find a keep-out spell soon.
Buffy,I know I'll sleep easier when I can... sleep easier.
Willow,"I'm sure he will. He's like book-man. (puts away the food)  Until then, try and keep happy thoughts and..."
Buffy,And what?
Buffy,Willow?
Buffy,Willow?
Willow,"Thanks for having me over, Buffy. Especially on a school night  and all."
Buffy,"No problem. Hey, sorry about your fish."
Willow,"Oh, it's okay. We hadn't really had time to bond yet. Although  for the first time I'm glad my parents didn't let me have a puppy."
Buffy,"(stares into space) It's so weird... Every time something like  this happens, my first instinct is still to run to Angel. I can't  believe it's the same person. He's completely different from the guy  that I knew. (looks at Willow)"
Willow,"Well, sort of, except..."
Buffy,Except what?
Willow,(looks at Buffy) You're still the only thing he thinks about.
Drusilla,"I brought something for you. (brings out the whining puppy)  Poor thing. She's an orphan. (reaches Spike) Her owner died... (smiles  at him) without a fight. Do you like her? (he looks at her) Hmm?  (reaches her hand into his jacket and rubs his chest) I brought her  especially for you... (pulls at his jacket) to cheer you up. (raises the  puppy) And I've named her... (sweetly) Sunshine! (offers the puppy to  Spike) Open wide. (he looks away) Come on, love. You need to eat  something to keep your strength up. Now, (waves the puppy around) rrrrr,  open up for mummy."
Spike,"I won't have you feeding me like a child, Dru. (wheels around  the table)"
Angelus,"(comes in) Why not? She already bathes you, carries you around  and changes you like a child."
Drusilla,"Why, Angel. (he smiles at her) Where have you been? The sun  is almost up, and it can be so hurtful. (looks at Spike) We were  worried."
Spike,"No, we weren't."
Drusilla,You must forgive Spike. He's just a bit testy tonight.  Doesn't get out much anymore.
Angelus,"Well, maybe next time I'll bring you with me, Spike. Might be  handy to have you around if I ever need a really good parking space."
Spike,Have you forgotten that you're a bloody guest in my bloody home?
Angelus,"(steps closer) And as a guest, (leans in) if there's anything  I can do for you... Any... responsibility I can assume while you're  spinning your wheels... (looks over at Drusilla) Anything I'm not  already doing, that is."
Spike,(shoves Angelus away angrily) That's enough!
Drusilla,Aww...
Drusilla,You two boys... fightin' over me and all. (stops between two  chairs) Makes a girl feel...
Spike,"Dru, what is it, pet?"
Drusilla,"(bent over in pain, breathing hard) The air. It worries.  Someone... an old enemy is seeking help... (Angelus throws Spike a look)  help to destroy our happy home. (leans against a chair) Ohhhh..."
Shopkeeper,(with a Rumanian accent) Welcome. How may I serve you  today?
Jenny,(faces him) Uh...
Shopkeeper,Love potion? Perhaps a voodoo doll for that unfaithful...
Jenny,(interrupts) I need an Orb of Thesulah.
Shopkeeper,"(drops the accent) Oh, you're in the trade. Sorry about the  spiel, but around Valentine's Day, I get a lot of tourists shopping for  love potions and mystical revenge of past lovers. (goes behind the sales  counter) Sad fact is, Ouija boards and rabbits' feet, that's what pay  the rent around here. (goes into the back) So how did you hear about us?"
Jenny,(checks out a few things) My Uncle Enyos told me about you.
Shopkeeper,"(looks out at her) So you're Janna, then. (she looks at  him) Sorry to hear about your uncle."
Jenny,Thank you.
Shopkeeper,"(comes back with a round wooden box) He was a good  customer. Well, no, there you go. (sets it down and opens it) One  Thesulan Orb. Spirit vault for the rituals of the undead. (Jenny reaches  into her purse) I don't get many calls for those lately. (she pulls out  her wallet) Sold a couple as new age paperweights last year. (she hands  him a credit card) Yeah, I just love those new-agers, boy. They helped  to (imprints the card) send my youngest to college. (fills in the form)  By the way, you do know that the transliteration annals for the ritual  of the undead were lost. (hands her the form and a pen) Without the  annals, the surviving text is gibberish."
Jenny,"And without a translated text, the Orbs of Thesulah are pretty  much useless. (signs) Yeah, I know. (hands him his copy)"
Shopkeeper,"Well, I only mention it because I have a strict policy of  no refunds. (puts the lid on the box)"
Jenny,It's okay. I'm working on a computer program to translate the  Rumanian liturgy to English based on a random sampling of the text.
Shopkeeper,Yecchh. I don't like computers. They give me the willies.
Jenny,"Well, (takes the box) thank you."
Shopkeeper,You're welcome.
Shopkeeper,"By the way... (she looks back) Not that it's any of my  business, really, but, uh, what are you planning on conjuring up? If you  can decipher the text?"
Jenny,A present for a friend of mine. (lifts the Orb)
Shopkeeper,Really? What are you gonna give him?
Jenny,His soul.
Buffy,"We'll be in hiding, probably... (inaudible)"
Willow,(inaudible)
Buffy,Siberia.
Xander,"(jumps up behind them) Well, good morning, ladies. And what did  you two do last night?"
Willow,We had kind of a 'pajama party sleepover with weapons' thing.
Xander,Oh. And I don't suppose either of you had the presence of mind  to locate a camera to capture the moment.
Willow,"I have to go. I have a class to teach in about five minutes,  and I have to arrive early to glare disapprovingly at the stragglers.  (sees Jenny arriving) Oh, darn. She's here. (walks off) Five hours of  lesson planning yesterday down the drain..."
Buffy,"(sees Jenny, too) You know what? I'll see you in class."
Buffy,Hey.
Jenny,Hi.
Jenny,"Uh, is there something that... Did you want something?"
Buffy,"Look... I know you feel badly about what happened, and I just  wanted to say..."
Buffy,Good. Keep it up.
Jenny,"(not surprised) Don't worry, I will."
Buffy,"(holds up her hand) Oh, wait. Um... (looks at her) He misses  you. He doesn't say anything, I mean, but I know he does. And I don't  want him to be lonely. I don't want anyone to."
Jenny,"Buffy, you know that if I have a chance to make this up..."
Buffy,(interrupts) We're... good here. Let's just leave it.
Giles,"I put it here somewhere. (finds the flyers)  Oh, yes, yes.  That's it. (hands the flyers to the students) Could you, um, hang those  up? (the students nod) Thank you. (sees Buffy arrive) Buffy. So, uh, so  how was your night?"
Buffy,"Sleepless, but no human fatalities."
Giles,I-I found a ritual to revoke the invitation to vampires.
Cordelia,"Oh, thank goodness. I actually had to talk my grandmother  into switching cars with me last night."
Giles,"Um, the-the-the, uh, the ritual's fairly basic, actually. It's  just the recitation of a few rhyming couplets, burning of, uh, moss  herbs, sprinkling of holy water... (turns down the hall)"
Buffy,(starts to follow) All stuff I have in my house.
Giles,Hanging of crosses...
Willow,I'm gonna have a hard time explaining this to my dad.
Buffy,You really think it'll bother him?
Willow,Ira Rosenberg's only daughter nailing crucifixes to her bedroom  wall? I have to go over to Xander's house just to watch 'A Charlie Brown  Christmas' every year.
Buffy,I see your point.
Willow,Although it is worthwhile to see him do the Snoopy Dance. (puts  down the hammer)
Cordelia,"Willow, (faces them, arms crossed) are you aware that there  are no fish in your aquarium?"
Buffy,"You know, Cordelia, we've already done your car. Call it a night  if you want."
Cordelia,Right. Thanks. And you know I'd do the same for you if you  had a social life.
Cordelia,Oh. (picks it up) This must be for you.
Willow,It's for you.
Buffy,Mom.
Angelus,"Mrs. Summers, I need to talk to you."
Joyce,(gets out with a bag of groceries) You're Angel.
Angelus,(pushes the door closed) Did Buffy tell you about us?
Joyce,She told me she wants you to leave her alone.
Angelus,I-I can't. I can't do that.
Joyce,You're scaring her.
Angelus,"You have to help me. (she starts toward the house) Joyce...  (follows her) I need, I need to be with her. Y-you can convince her. You  have to convince her."
Joyce,"Look, (Angelus gets in front of her) I'm telling you to leave  her alone."
Angelus,"You have to talk to her for me, Joyce. Tell her I need her."
Joyce,"(goes around him) Please, look, I-I just wanna get inside, okay?"
Angelus,"You don't understand, Joyce. (she finds her keys) I'll die  without Buffy. She'll die without me."
Joyce,Are you threatening her?
Angelus,Please... Why is she doing this to me?
Joyce,I'm calling the police now.
Angelus,I haven't been able to sleep since the night we made love.
Angelus,I need her. I know you understand.
Joyce,(opens the door) Just leave us alone. (rushes in)
Willow,'Hicce verbis consensus rescissus est.'
Translation,By these strong unanimous words [Angelus' permission to  enter] is rescinded.
Buffy,"(comes up to him) Sorry, Angel. Changed the locks. (slams the  door in his face)"
Giles,Hello.
Jenny,Oh! Hi.
Giles,(steps into the room) You're working late.
Jenny,Special project.
Giles,Oh.
Jenny,I spoke to Buffy today.
Giles,Oh! Yes? (sits on her desk)
Jenny,Mm. (looks away) She said you missed me. (plays with a pencil)
Giles,"Well, uh, she's... a meddlesome girl."
Jenny,"(looks at him) Rupert... Okay, I don't wanna say anything if I'm  wrong, but I may have some news. Now, I need to finish up here. Could I  see you later?"
Giles,"Y-yes, yes. You could stop by my house."
Jenny,Okay. (smiles)
Giles,"(smiles and gets up) Good. (smiles wider, then goes)"
Shopkeeper,"Sorry, honey. (blows out some candles) We're closed."
Shopkeeper,(nervous) W... What do you want?
Drusilla,(looks at the puppy) Miss Sunshine here tells me you had a  visit today. (stares up) But she worries. (looks at the shopkeeper) She  wants to know what you and the mean teacher talked about.
Jenny,"Come on, come on..."
Jenny,That's it! (exhales and smiles) It's gonna work! (saves the  result) This... will work.
Jenny,Angel... (slowly moves toward the door) How did you get in here?
Angelus,I was invited. The sign in front of the school... 'Formatia  trans sicere educatorum.'
Jenny,'Enter all ye who seek knowledge.'
Angelus,(giggles and gets up) What can I say? I'm a knowledge seeker.  (comes toward her)
Jenny,"(frightened) Angel, I-I-I've got good news."
Angelus,"I heard. You went shopping at the local boogedy-boogedy store.  (sees the Orb on her desk and picks it up) The Orb of Thesulah. If  memory serves, this is supposed to summon a person's soul... from the  ether... store it until it can be transferred."
Angelus,You know what I hate most about these things?
Angelus,"(smiles) They're so damn fragile. (loses the smile) Must be  that shoddy gypsy craftsmanship, huh?"
Angelus,I never cease to be amazed how much the world has changed in  just two and a half centuries.
Angelus,"It's a miracle to me. You, you put the secrets to restoring my  soul in here..."
Angelus,"It comes out here. (looks at the paper) 'The Ritual of  Restoration.' Wow. This, this brings back memories."
Jenny,Wait. That's your...
Angelus,"Oh, my cure? (finishes tearing) No, thanks. Been there, done  that, and deja vu just isn't what it used to be. (sees the fire) My...  Isn't this my lucky day. The computer... (holds the paper over the  flames) and the pages. (warms his hands) Looks like I get to kill two  birds with one stone."
Angelus,And teacher makes three.
Jenny,No!
Angelus,"Oh, good. I need to work up an appetite first."
Angelus,"Sorry, Jenny, this is where you get off."
Angelus,Ah... I never get tired of doing that.
Giles,"Willow, good evening. (steps in)"
Willow,"Hi. Come on in. (closes the door, hands him the book) Here's  the book."
Giles,Right. (looks the book over) I guess I should do my apartment  tonight. (looks up) The ritual go all right?
Willow,"Oh, yeah. It went fine. Well, it went fine until Angel showed  up and told Buffy's mom that he and Buffy had... (nervously) Well, you  know, that they had... you know. You do know, right?"
Giles,"Oh, yes. Yes. Sorry."
Willow,"(relieved) Oh, good, 'cause I just realized that being a  librarian and all, you maybe didn't know."
Giles,"Oh, thank you. I got it."
Willow,"You would have been proud of her, though. She totally kept her  cool. (smiles)"
Willow,"Okay, well, I'll tell Buffy you stopped by. (smiles)"
Giles,"(looks up the stairs) Would you, um... Perhaps I should  intervene on, on Buffy's behalf w-w-with her mother. Um, maybe... say  something?"
Willow,"Sure! Like, what would you say?"
Giles,(looks up the stairs again) W... Uh...
Giles,You will tell Buffy I dropped by? (goes out)
Willow,You bet. (closes the door)
Buffy,"That stuff with the Latins and the herbs, uh, he's just real  superstitious."
Joyce,(sits with her eyes closed) Oh.
Buffy,We just thought if...
Joyce,"Was he the first? (opens her eyes) No, wait. (stands up) I don't  wanna know. (paces) I don't think I want to."
Buffy,"Yeah. He was the first. I mean, the only."
Joyce,(stops and looks at her daughter) He's older than you.
Buffy,I know.
Joyce,"Too old, Buffy. And he's obviously not very stable. I really  wish... (sits again) I just thought you would show more judgment."
Buffy,(looks at her mother) He wasn't like this before.
Joyce,Are you in love with him?
Buffy,I was.
Joyce,Were you careful?
Buffy,"(looks away) Mom, this is no time..."
Joyce,"(gets up again) Don't 'Mom' me, Buffy. You don't get to get out  of this. You had sex with a boy you *didn't* even see fit to tell me you  were dating."
Buffy,(nods) I made a mistake.
Joyce,"Yeah, well, don't just say that to shut me up, because I think  you really did."
Buffy,I know that! (looks up at her) I-I can't tell you everything.
Joyce,"How about anything? Buffy, you can shut me out of your life, I  am pretty much used to that. But don't expect me to ever stop caring  about you, because it's never gonna happen. I love you more than  anything in the world. (sits next to Buffy on the bed) That would be  your cue to, uh, roll your eyes and tell me I'm grossing you out."
Buffy,You're not.
Joyce,"(inhales) Oh, well... (exhales) I guess that was the talk."
Buffy,So how'd it go?
Joyce,I don't know. It was my first.
Giles,Hello?
Giles,Jenny?
Giles,It's me!
Officer,"Mr. Giles, I need to ask you to come with us. Just to answer a  few questions."
Giles,(still staring blankly) Of course. Yes. Procedure. (looks at the  officer) I need to make a phone call... if that's all right.
Giles,(whispers) Yes. (goes to the phone)
Angelus,(narrates) Passion is the source of our finest moments. The  joy of love... the clarity of hatred... and the ecstasy of grief.
Buffy,"Hello. Giles, hey! We did the, the thing. It worked. What?"
Willow,Giles?
Willow,What? No! (puts the phone down) No! (begins to cry  uncontrollably) Noooo!
Buffy,Where's Giles?
Xander,"No luck. By the time we got to the station, (closes the door)  the cops said he'd already left. (Cordelia closes her door) I guess they  just wanted to ask him some questions."
Buffy,"Cordelia, will you drive us to Giles' house?"
Cordelia,Of course.
Willow,But don't you think he wants to be left alone?
Buffy,I'm not worrying about what he wants. I'm worried about what  he's gonna do.
Xander,Hello? Giles?
Xander,I guess Giles had a big night planned tonight.
Buffy,(picks up the sketch of Jenny) Giles didn't set this up. Angel  did. (hands Xander the sketch) This is the wrapping for the gift. (heads  upstairs)
Xander,"Oh, man. (exhales) Poor Giles."
Willow,"Look, all his weapons are gone."
Cordelia,But I thought he kept his weapons at the library.
Xander,"No, those are his, uh, everyday weapons. These were his good  weapons. The ones he, uh, breaks out when company comes to visit."
Willow,So he's not here.
Cordelia,"Well, then where is he?"
Buffy,He'll go to wherever Angel is.
Willow,"That means the factory, right?"
Cordelia,So Giles is gonna try to kill Angel then?
Xander,"Well, it's about time somebody did."
Willow,Xander!
Xander,"I'm sorry, but let's not forget that I hated Angel long before  you guys jumped on the bandwagon. So I think I deserve a little  something for not saying 'I told you so' long before now. And if Giles  wants to go after the, uh, (looks up at Buffy) fiend that murdered his  girlfriend, I say, 'Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!' (looks back at Willow  and Cordelia)"
Buffy,You're right.
Xander,Thank you.
Buffy,(takes the rest of the steps down) There's only one thing wrong  with Giles' little revenge scenario.
Xander,And what's that?
Buffy,It's gonna get him killed.
Spike,"Are you insane?! We're supposed to kill the bitch, not leave gag  gifts in the friends' beds."
Drusilla,"(cuddles her puppy) But, Spike, the bad teacher was going to  restore Angel's soul."
Spike,"What if she did? If you ask me, I find myself preferring the old  Buffy-whipped Angelus. This new, improved one is not playing with a full  sack. (gets a look from Angelus) I love a good slaughter as much as the  next bloke, but his little pranks will only leave us with one incredibly  brassed-off Slayer!"
Angelus,"Don't worry, roller boy. I've got everything under control."
Angelus,"Jeez, whatever happened to wooden stakes?"
Spike,Uh-uh. No fair going into the ring unless he tags you first.
Angelus,All right. You've had your fun. But you know what it's time  for now?
Buffy,My fun.
Angelus,Are you gonna let your old man just burn?
Giles,Why did you come here?! This wasn't your fight!
Buffy,Are you trying to get yourself killed?!
Buffy,You can't leave me. I can't do this alone.
Angelus,(narrates) It hurts sometimes more than we can bear.
Angelus,"(narrates) If we could live without passion, maybe we'd know  some kind of peace. But we would be hollow."
Angelus,"(narrates) Empty rooms, shuttered and dank..."
Angelus,"(narrates) Without passion, we'd be truly dead."
