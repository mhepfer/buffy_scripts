YOUNG ROBIN,"<br>    (from behind the bench) Mamma!"
NIKKI,"<br>    (goes up to Robin, squats down to be on eye-level with him) You did a good     job, baby boy. You stayed down just like mamma told you."
YOUNG ROBIN,"<br>    Can we go home now?"

BUFFY,"<br>    (puts her purse down) Well, no fires, no one's head's going kablooey. And     the swing choir and the marching band have gone back to their normal, healthy     seething resentment."
ROBIN,"<br>    (smiles) Yeah, it's been pretty quiet around here since you shut down that     seal. (walks up to Buffy) You just may have stopped this thing, Buffy."

ROBIN,"<br>    Yeah. Yeah, what I remember of her, anyway."
BUFFY,"<br>    Got to tell you, not a line every girl likes to hear, but&#151;in this case&#151;     (smiles) compliment taken. Maybe you're right. Maybe everything is fine."
GILES,"<br>    (walks up to Buffy) Everything's terrible. Total catastrophe."
BUFFY,"<br>    Giles, what's wrong?"
GILES,"<br>    Have you seen the new library? There's nothing but computers. There's not     a book to be seen. I&#151;I don't know where to begin, Buffy. I mean, who     do we speak to?"
ROBIN,"<br>    Uh, that would&#151;that would be me. (offers his hand to Giles) Hi. I'm Robin     Wood."
GILES,"<br>    Oh, sorry. (shakes Robin's hand) Rupert Giles. Sorry. Buffy tells me you're     something of a freelance demon fighter. (Robin points to his office door,     then closes it) Oh, yes, yes. I, um, I'm relieved. We're running dangerously     low on allies."
BUFFY,"<br>    So, we didn't stop it, then?"
GILES,"<br>    (leans forward on Robin's desk) Uh, no, the seers at the coven are certain     the First is continuing to gather its forces. I'm afraid war is inevitable.     (stands) So, we should go before the school board."
ROBIN,"<br>    (confused) What?"
GILES,"<br>    Well, I can have my backup library (Buffy rolls her eyes) sent from home in     the mean time. It's not much, but&#151;"
BUFFY,"<br>    Giles."
GILES,"<br>    Knowledge comes from crafted bindings and pages, Buffy, not ones and zeros."
BUFFY,"<br>    So, did you bring back any potentials?"
GILES,"<br>    Um, no. Actually, m-my, uh, (takes off glasses to clean them) my trip is about     something else...regarding Spike."
BUFFY,"<br>    Spike? What about him?"
GILES,"<br>    I told you my concerns when you recklessly chose (puts glasses on) to remove     the chip from his head."
ROBIN,"<br>    Wait, sorry, chip?"
GILES,"<br>    Uh, it's a long story."
BUFFY,"<br>    The military put a chip in Spike's head so he couldn't hurt anyone."
GILES,"<br>    And that would be the abridged version."
BUFFY,"<br>    But he wouldn't hurt anyone anymore because he has a soul now."
GILES,"<br>    Unless the First triggers him again."
ROBIN,"<br>    Triggers the chip?"
BUFFY,"<br>    No, the trigger's a post-hypnotic thing. The First put it in his head. It     was&#151;made him&#151; He was killing again."
ROBIN,"<br>    So, he has a trigger, a soul, and a chip?"
GILES,"<br>    Not anymore."
BUFFY,"<br>    (angrily) It was killing him, Giles."
ROBIN,"<br>    The trigger?"
BUFFY,"<br>    No, the chip. The trigger's not active anymore."
ROBIN,"<br>    Because the military gave him a soul? (Buffy and Giles glare at Robin, who     throws up his hands) Sorry."
GILES,"<br>    We don't know that the trigger is inactive. (walks over to the window) What     I brought back may help us to disarm it, to ascertain exactly what it is that     causes Spike's behavior."
BUFFY,"<br>    It was that song, Giles. I'm telling you, it was that song that Spike was     singing."
GILES,"<br>    He has no memory of it. Is there any part of it that you can remember?"
BUFFY,"<br>    It wasn't like it had a catchy hook or anything like &quot;I'm coming up,     so you better get this party started.&quot; It was boring, old, and English.     Just like you&#151;ull. Yule Brenner. (Giles crosses his arms and glares at     Buffy) A British Yule Brenner."
ROBIN,"<br>    (to Giles) This thing you brought to keep Spike from killing again... How's     it work?"
GILES,"<br>    Well, it will require a bit of magic."

XANDER,"<br>    (sighs, stands, looks around) Nothing. (walks away)"

ROBIN,"<br>    I thought you might need support."
SPIKE,"<br>    Uh-huh. Right, let's get this over with. (to Giles) What're you gonna do?     Some hypno-beam? A disarming spell?"
GILES,"<br>    (walks up to Spike, but keeps his distance) Not exactly. The First has brainwashed     you. There's something in your subconscious that it's using to provoke a violent     reaction. So... (takes a small box out of his pocket, and takes a small rock     out of the box) we have to put this in your brain."
SPIKE,"<br>    Bugger that!"
GILES,"<br>    The Prokaryote stone will move within your mind to reveal the root of the     trigger's power. Can unleash ideas, images, memories... Hopefully, once you     understand what it is that's...(rolls his eyes) setting you off, you can break     its hold on you."
DAWN,"<br>    Hopefully? So, it might not work?"
GILES,"<br>    The stone's just a catalyst for the process. The rest is up to Spike."
SPIKE,"<br>    And how do expect to get that hunk of rubble into my cranium?"
GILES,"<br>    Willow? (puts the stone in the box and holds it out toward Willow)"

SPIKE,"<br>    (recoiling) Oh, you have got to be joking? What now?"
GILES,"<br>    It has to access the cerebral cortex via the optic nerve."
SPIKE,"<br>    Oh, bollocks. With all the rubbish people keep sticking in my head, it's a     wonder that there's room for my brain."
GILES,"<br>    (rolls his eyes) I don't think it takes up that much space, do you?"
SPIKE,"<br>    Ow. Oh, ow!"
BUFFY,"<br>    (runs to his side) Spike! Spike, listen to me."
SPIKE,"<br>    Yeah."

WILLOW,"<br>    Will do. (walks upstairs)"
GILES,"<br>    Think about what you're doing."
BUFFY,"<br>    I have. (unchains Spike, then walks toward the stairs, with Spike following     her)"
GILES,"<br>    Buffy..."
BUFFY,"<br>    (continues walking without stopping) Don't."
ROBIN,"<br>    Mr. Giles... You got a moment?"
GILES,"<br>    What's on your mind?"
ROBIN,"<br>    The same thing that's on yours. (looks up the stairs) We got ourselves a problem."
GILES,"<br>    Spike. (sighs)"
ROBIN,"<br>    Yeah, if that trigger's still working, then the First must be waiting for     just the right time to use it against us."
GILES,"<br>    It does seem doubtful the First simply forgot it had such a powerful weapon."
ROBIN,"<br>    Yeah, a while back, it slipped up. It told Andrew it wasn't time yet for Spike.     So, whatever the First's ultimate plan is, it's obvious that Spike must play     an integral part in that. Something needs to be done."
GILES,"<br>    (shakes his head) Buffy would never allow it. (walks back downstairs to talk     with Robin)"
ROBIN,"<br>    Buffy would listen to her Watcher, wouldn't she?"
GILES,"<br>    I don't think you have much of an idea of the Watcher-Slayer dynamic."
ROBIN,"<br>    As a matter of fact, I was raised by a Watcher."
GILES,"<br>    You were?"
ROBIN,"<br>    Bernard Crowley. Took me in when I was a young kid, trained me."
GILES,"<br>    Crowley. I remember the name. New York based watcher. Resigned shortly after     his slayer was&#151; (looks at Robin carefully) You're Nikki Wood's son."
ROBIN,"<br>    (nods) Yes."
GILES,"<br>    Spike killed your mother."
ROBIN,"<br>    (looks away) Yes."
GILES,"<br>    (looks down) Does Buffy know this?"
ROBIN,"<br>    She knows my mother was a slayer. She...doesn't know about Spike."
GILES,"<br>    (shrugs) And this has nothing to do with personal vengeance?"
ROBIN,"<br>    Does it matter? He's an instrument of evil. Now he's gonna prove to be our     undoing in this fight, Buffy's undoing, and she will never&#151;never see     it coming. Now, I'm talking about what needs to be done... for the greater     good, Giles. And you know I'm right."
GILES,"<br>    (sighs) What exactly do you propose?"
ROBIN,"<br>    I just need you to keep Buffy away for a few hours."

BUFFY,"<br>    I don't know, Giles. Is this really a primo time for a training session?"
GILES,"<br>    I'm still your teacher, Buffy. As adept as you are as a slayer, there are     always new things to learn. Now, more than ever, it's crucial to maintain     focus on your calling."
BUFFY,"<br>    In case you haven't noticed, our plates are kinda full right now. Plus, I'm     not really sure how I feel about leaving Spike at Robin's house to watch over     him."
GILES,"<br>    For what its worth everyone at your house seemed....quite relieved at the     arrangement. Um, Buffy, uh...while I'm not technically your Watcher anymore,     the fact that your life is such chaos only underscores the importance of the     lessons I can impart to you."
BUFFY,"<br>    Fine. Impart away."
GILES,"<br>    We're on the verge of war. It's time you looked at the big picture."
BUFFY,"<br>    Hello! All I do is look at the big picture. The other day, I gave an inspirational     speech to the telephone repair man."
GILES,"<br>    It takes more than rousing speeches to lead, Buffy. If you're going to be     a general, you need to be able to make difficult decisions regardless of cost."
BUFFY,"<br>    Have you seen me with those girls? (paces) I mean, the way I've treated my     friends and my family and... Andrew. Believe me, I know how to make hard decisions."
GILES,"<br>    Well, that's what we're here to find out. (a vampire reaches out of his grave)     While we work on the basics."
