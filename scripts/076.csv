character,dialogue
McNamara,"These are exceptional boys. Their capture ratio
just keeps increasing. *They're* keeping it together. Morale's a
problem. The death of Professor Walsh. The escape of the prototype.
Controlling the HSTs is getting harder. We have serious overcrowding
in the containment areas."
McNamara,"It's not my mess, sir. I'm just holding the fort
while you figure out what you want to do with the place."
McNamara,"Fell in with a bad crowd. Quite frankly, I don't
think he was ever the soldier that you all hoped he was. Boy thinks
too much."
McNamara,"We'll catch up to him. My feeling is . . he won't
stray too far from the girl."
McNamara,She's just a girl.
Spike,(sighs) She's a lot more than that.
Spike,The Slayer's dangerous is all I'm saying.
ADAM,Yes. She makes things interesting.
Spike,"No. See? You're not getting it, Mr. Bits.
You're gonna be interestingly dead. (paces again) Little Miss Tiny's got
a habit of bollixing up the plans of every would-be, unstoppable
bad-ass who sets foot in this town."
Spike,"Just want you to know, when the big ugly goes down, the
Slayer's gonna be right in the thick of it. You ready for that?"
ADAM,I'm counting on it.
ADAM,Two Slayers.
Spike,(closing the lighter) That's right.
ADAM,And you killed them both?
Spike,(grinning) Yeah. I killed the hell out of them.
ADAM,Yet you fear this one?
Spike,"(offended) Hey, watch it, mate. I don't fear anything.
Just know my enemies."
ADAM,Do you? Then why haven't you killed this Slayer yet?
Spike,"Because . . . (trails off) Stinking, rotten luck is why.
On top of that, now I got this buggering chip up my head."
ADAM,"Yes. Your behavior modification circuitry. I
know what you feel."
Spike,(scoffs softly) Not likely.
ADAM,"You feel smothered. Trapped like an animal.
Pure in its ferocity, unable to actualize the urges within. Clinging
to one truth. Like a flame struggling to burn within an enclosed
glass. That a beast this powerful cannot be contained. Inevitably
it will break free and savage the land again. I will make you whole
again. Make you savage."
Spike,"(awed) Wow. (composes himself) I mean, *yeah*. I get why
the demons all fall in line with you. (sits up) You're like Tony Robbins.
If he was a big scary . . Frankenstein looking-- (reconsiders) You're
exactly like Tony Robbins."
ADAM,"I will restore you to what you once were. When
I have the Slayer . . . how and where I want her."
Spike,"(sighs) Easier said. She's crafty. Her and her little
friends."
ADAM,Friends?
Spike,"There's your --what do you call it-- variable. The
Slayer's got pals. You want her evening the odds in a fight you don't
want the Slayerettes mucking about."
ADAM,Take them away from her.
Spike,"Now there's a plan. She's working solo, she won't
have a chance to come after us when the wild rumpus begins. (chuckles)
Plus, it will make her miserable. And I never get tired of that."
Spike,(to himself) Yeah. Leave `em to me.
ADAM,"You can't hurt them. What can you do to make sure
they're out of the picture?"
Spike,Not a blessed thing. They're gonna do it for me.
Riley,Do you know if she's back yet?
Xander,"L.A. Woman? Haven't heard from her. She'll
probably come here first thing, though. Hey, who's your buddy?"
Xander,"So you don't have to be G.I. Joe while your civvies are
getting washed."
Xander,Try those on. You'll feel like a new man.
Riley,"Would this man have a bright red nose and big, floppy feet?"
Riley,"Hey, I'm sorry. That's the cabin fever talking."
Xander,But as post-apocalypse-splendor goes . . .
Riley,I've done wonders with the place.
Xander,Yeah.
Riley,"Still . . The sooner Buffy gets back, the better I'll feel."
Xander,"You and me both, big guy."
Riley,I take it you're not an Angel fan either?
Xander,"Well, it's not like I hate the guy. Just, you know
. . the guts part of him."
Riley,"Can't blame you. But to be fair, it's not him you
hate. It's the curse."
Riley,Right?
Xander,What did Buffy tell you?
Riley,"On Angel? Everything. More than I wanted to
know sometimes. She loved him. He turned evil. He, uh,
killed people. She cured him. He left. Interesting little
curse."
Xander,One moment's happiness.
Riley,What do you mean?
Xander,"You know, it's his trigger. Angel's an okay guy
if he's mopey and sad and brooding, but if you give him even one second
of pure, real pleasure . . ."
Riley,And that sets him off.
Xander,"Only in the big ol ""kill your friends"" kind of way.
And you know what makes Angel happiest? I'll give you a hint.
It not creme brulee."
Riley,Buffy.
Riley,Sex (scoffs softly) with Buffy.
Xander,"She . . . kind of left that part out, huh?"
Riley,"Yeah, she did. That explains a lot of things that
. . I wish weren't explained."
Xander,"Hey, man. That's all ancient history."
Riley,(scoffs) She went running to L.A. to bone up on her history.
Xander,"No! I'm sure it's boneless. She just needs
to make sure everything's okay. She's probably back already."
Riley,Maybe.
Xander,You'll feel a lot better when you see her.
Riley,I guess we'll see.
Giles,(singing) If I leave here tomorrow/
Giles,(singing) Would you still remember me?/
Giles,"(singing) Well I must be traveling on now/ There's too many places
I've got to see/"
Giles,"(singing) And if I stay here with you girl/ Things just couldn't
be the same/"
Giles,(singing) 'Cause I'm as free as bird now--(high-pitched gasp)
Spike,"You know, for someone who's got ""Watcher"" on his resume', you
might want to cast an eye to the front door every now and again."
Giles,What do you want?
Spike,"Ah. (he takes out a transfusion blood bag) Knew I left
one. (closes fridge) Buffy around?"
Giles,Why?
Spike,"I need to speak to the lady of the house. Hey, be
a pet and give her a message for me, would you? Tell her I just might
have something she just might want."
Giles,"And what might that ""something"" be?"
Spike,"Information. Highly classified. Not cheap word-on-the-street
prattle either. I'm talking about the good stuff now."
Giles,Thrill me.
Spike,"(sighs) It's nothing I know. What, you think I'd come running
over saying ""I've got a secret, beat me till I talk?"" There's files
in the Initiative. I'm pretty sure I know where."
Giles,Files?
Spike,(taking out the bag) Yeah. Secrets.
Spike,"Mission statements. Design schematics. All
of Maggie Walsh's dirty laundry, which I guess would include lots of tidbits
about--"
Giles,(removing glasses) Adam.
Spike,"Well, yeah. Say someone were to risk his life and
limb --well, limb anyway-- to obtain said files. It might be worth
a little something."
Giles,"A-at . . this point a cynical person might think that you're
offering just what we need when we need it most."
Spike,"That person'd be right, Rupert. Supply and demand.
And it won't be cheap this time."
Giles,What do you want?
Spike,"Hmm, year supply of blood, guaranteed protection, merry
bushels of cash, and, most important . . . a guarantee that I'm not to
be in anyway slain."
Giles,(puts on glasses) Done.
Spike,"With a smile and a nod from you? Sorry. Not
close to good enough. This deal's with the Slayer."
Giles,I'll tell her.
Spike,"Oh, you'll tell her! Great comfort that. What
makes you think she'll listen to you?"
Giles,"Because . . . (trails off, unsure)"
Spike,Very convincing.
Giles,I'm her Watcher.
Spike,"I think you're neglecting the past-tense there, Rupert.
Besides, she barely listened to you when you were in charge. I've
seen the way she treats you."
Giles,"Oh, yes? And how's that?"
Spike,Very much like a retired librarian.
Spike,"Look, I've got what she wants as long as she has what I
want."
Spike,Spread the word. She knows where to find me.
Giles,"(softly, without authority) I'll think about it."
Willow,"Oh. I keep thinking ""Okay, that's the cutest thing
ever,"" and then she does something cuter and completely resets the whole
scale."
Tara,Did you see her yawn earlier?
Willow,Yes! I thought I was going to die.
Willow,"(babying voice) Oh, I love you, Miss Kitty Fantastico!"
Tara,We got to get her a real name.
Willow,"It's so cool that she's ours. (pause) Uh, yours.
That she's yours is-is cool."
Tara,She can be ours if you want?
Tara,"You still need an elective. (glances down at booklet) How
about . . Sophomore Level Psychology?"
Willow,"Oh. Kinda psyched out since Professor Walsh.
Maybe something fun like drama. I could be dramatic."
Willow,"(dramatic voice) You cannot have more catnip! You
have a catnip problem!"
Tara,(laughing) Definitely drama.
Willow,"I haven't even dealt with the housing situation yet.
Have you done anything? I hear there some off-campus places that
are way cool for groups to, you know, go in on."
Tara,"Oh, I just figured you'd be dorming it up with Buffy again."
Willow,"Well, we haven't really talked about it. I used
to assume we'd be roomies through grad school well into little old lady
hood. You know, cheating at bingo together and forgetting to take our pills."
Tara,But?
Willow,"But . . . I don't know. It hardly feels like we're
roomies now. I mean, she's busy with Riley and I'm gone a lot too."
Willow,I guess I should ask her.
Buffy,Riley.
Riley,"I got a little tired of sitting around waiting, so . .
."
Buffy,You joined the circus?
Riley,"Xander took my clothes to clean `em and left me these.
(stepping inside) Does he, uh, hate me in some way I don't know about yet?
I think I would've attracted less attention in my uniform."
Buffy,(uncertain) Is it okay for you to be here?
Riley,You tell me.
Buffy,"I just meant with the government branch hunting you down
and all."
Riley,I'm good.
Riley,"And, uh, it took me a while, but I patched into their frequency.
(clicks it on and we hear a garbled voice) Can't sneak up on a guy if he's
listening in."
Buffy,You're the sneakiest.
Riley,Why they hired me.
Riley,You okay?
Buffy,Yeah. I just-- Angel kind of upset me.
Riley,How?
Buffy,It's not that interesting.
Riley,Got my attention.
Buffy,He just spun my head a little.
Riley,You don't want to talk about it.
Buffy,"It's just deconstructing Angel can wait. Right now,
I just want to get out there and patrol and-and find Adam. We can
talk about it . . later."
Riley,"It's the pants, isn't it? It's okay. I couldn't
take me seriously in these things either."
Buffy,"Riley, it's not that big a deal."
Riley,"Tell you what, why don't I get out of your face?
You had a long trip."
Buffy,"Look, you don't have to go."
Riley,"It's okay. (forcing a grin) Besides . . heh. (indicating
pants) I have to recharge them every two hours or they go dead on me."
Buffy,(quietly) Okay.
Xander,"Here. You should've just saved the ensemble from
the last time we snuck into the Initiative. (hands the clothes to Spike)
I'm not a clothing delivery service."
Anya,"Well, he is, kinda. He did Riley yesterday."
Spike,Hello. This is just . . . swell.
Spike,Gotta say . . liking this quite a lot.
Spike,Kinda changes the balances of pow--OWW!!
Spike,"Akk! Oh, come on! You got to be kidding?"
Anya,"(playing with her straw) Wow. That chip in your head means
you can't even point a gun. How humiliating."
Xander,Doesn't work anyway. It's a fake.
Anya,Can't even point a decorative gun?
Xander,Give it up for a American chipmanship.
Spike,"It doesn't work? What about self-defense? I'm
taking a risk here, you know?"
Xander,Can I tell you how much I really . . don't care?
Spike,"(warningly) Attitude. See how far that'll take you
in boot camp. (Xander gives him a questioning look) Say, I hope you get
one of those toughs-as-nails drill sergeants who's only hard on the men
because he's trying to keep them alive when the bullets start flying.
I love that stuff."
Xander,Boot camp? Yeah. Like I'd go there.
Spike,"What, you changed your mind? Not gonna join?"
Anya,(angry) You're joining the Army!?
Xander,"(to Anya) Okay, one-- Ow. (to Spike) Two-- Where'd you get that
idea? (to Anya) Three-- OW! I'm not joining the army!"
Anya,"Oh, good. Stopped that nonsense just in time."
Xander,I was never--
Xander,Who'd you hear this from?
Spike,"Oh, your girlie-mates were talking. Something about,
uh, being all you can be. Or all *you* can be. And having laugh.
Figured you were signing up. Say, have you got anything larger in
the . . toy gun line?"
Xander,"""All I can--"" (paces to the other side of the crypt) Can
you believe this!? Like I'm some sort of useless lunk. It happens
I'm good at a lot of things. I help out with all kinds of . . . stuff.
I have skills . . . and . . . stratagems. I'm very . . . (looks to Anya)
Help me out."
Anya,(nonchalant) He's Viking in the sack.
Spike,"(not caring) Terrific. (indicates the clothes in his hands) You
didn't have these cleaned after the last time, did you?"
Xander,"This is so like them, lately. It's all about them
and the college life. Well, you know what college is? It's
high school only without the actual going to class. Well . . high
school was kinda like that too. But the point is, I'm out there working
hard to make a living. It's nothing but a huge joke to them.
Xander got fired from Starbucks. Xander got fired from that phone-sex
line."
Anya,They look down on you.
Xander,And they hate you.
Anya,But they don't look down on me.
Spike,"Hey, it was just a laugh. There's no need to go insane
over it."
Xander,Is anybody talking to you?
Spike,"(mock gasp) Sir, no sir."
Forrest,Don't shoot.
Buffy,Give me a reason not to?
Forrest,You're killing humans now?
Buffy,"Not yet. (lowers blaster) Beating you senseless should
do just fine."
Forrest,"I can have a patrol here in under a minute. So
here's the plan: you go you're way, I'll go mine."
Buffy,I'm checking out that cave.
Forrest,My orders exactly.
Buffy,Alone?
Forrest,"We're spread a little thin, so yeah. Family's tearing
apart."
Buffy,"(sarcastic) Family. What kind of family are you?
Corleones."
Forrest,We weren't until you showed up.
Buffy,What? No girls in the club?
Forrest,"You think you're the first girlfriend Riley's ever had?
(she stops to glare at his back as he continues ahead) Such a big head
on that skinny little body. (he stops to face her) No. You're just
the first one to get him to commit treason. Riley had a career.
And a future till he met you. And, yeah, I got a problem with that."
Buffy,"A future? A future doing what? (steps closer to him)
Illegal experiments. Torture. Murder. I guess killing someone
isn't really a problem for you."
Forrest,"Less and less. And why don't you get the hell out
of here before I--"
Buffy,"(angry) Touch me and you'll find out what Slayer strength is
like."
Forrest,(gamely) I think it's about time you showed me then.
ADAM,(OS) Yes.
ADAM,I think that would be interesting.
Buffy,Get out of here!
Forrest,Not moving.
ADAM,Thank you.
Buffy,Go! Get out!
Buffy,NO!
Buffy,"Oh, God."
Spike,(closing the door) I think I lost the buggers.
Willow,Any luck with the disks?
Spike,"(handing them to her) Took what they had. Should be something
useful on one of them."
Willow,Hope so.
Tara,What are we looking for?
Willow,(sliding one of the disks into her laptop) Anything about Adam.
Giles,(unconcerned) Were there any problems getting in and out?
Spike,"No. I mean, a couple of them made me on the way out,
but I took care of `em."
Giles,"(sarcastic) Gave them a good running-away-from-them, did you?"
Spike,"Well, yeah. When do I get paid?"
Giles,When Willow tells me you've brought us something useful.
Spike,"I could've gone straight to the Slayer, you know?
I cut you in, let you pretend you're actually in charge, now you've
got to wait for Red's permission to finish the deal?"
Giles,As soon as we see what's on the disks.
Tara,It looks like gibberish.
Spike,Gibberish?
Willow,They're encrypted.
Giles,"Oh, wonderful."
Spike,Can you fix `em?
Willow,"Crack a government encryption code on my laptop?
Easy as really difficult pie. Why?"
Spike,"(sighs) You're not exactly the whiz these days either.
God, I'm never gonna get paid."
Willow,I am a whiz.
Tara,She is a whiz.
Willow,If every a whiz there was. I-I just need some time.
Spike,"No. I just heard you weren't . . . (Willow hits a
key and the jittering stops) Your mates said you weren't playing with computers
so much. (indicates Tara) Into the new thing."
Willow,(frowning) What new thing?
Spike,"(nonchalant) You know, you two. The whole wicca thing."
Willow,They-they were talking about that?
Spike,"Can we get back to business here? I've got a deal
at stake."
Willow,What did they say?
Spike,"(impatient sigh) Talking about, you know, it's a phase.
You'll get over it."
Willow,"What? Who said that? Was it Buffy? (to Tara)
'Cause . . . you know what she means by that."
Spike,"No, she was defending you. 'Cause Xander said you
were just being trendy."
Willow,Trendy?
Spike,"I don't know what they were going on about. A person
wants be a witch, that's their business."
Willow,(softly) I knew Buffy was freaked.
Tara,"You should talk to her, 'cause I'm sure she--"
Spike,"Pressing business, ladies. (pointing to the screen) Don't
want to get sidetracked. (taps it with his finger) Still got your monsters
to fight."
Lieutenant,"Cell capacity maxed out three days ago, sir.
We keep up this pace they'll be nowhere left to contain the hostiles."
McNamara,"(coldly) They're animals, lieutenant. We pack them in
until we're out of room and then we pack them in some more."
Lieutenant,"(worried) They're going to start tearing each other apart,
sir."
McNamara,I have no problem with that scenario.
Commando,"(on radio) Back-up team! Request immediate back-up!
Over! They're tearing us apart over here! Two men down!
From out of nowhere! Mayday! Repeat! Mayday!"
Commando,"(on phone) --Team Epsilon requesting immediate
back-up! We're in the alley behind the school building! Where
the hell is-- Fall back! Fall back! It's coming--"
Angel,Riley Finn.
Riley,I know you?
Angel,We have a friend in common.
Riley,Angel.
Angel,Welcoming committee your idea?
Riley,"Way I heard it. You were all peaceable now.
You didn't by any chance go and lose that pesky soul again, did you?"
Angel,"(dangerously) Don't push me, boy."
Riley,"(calm rage) Now what possibly could've happened with Buffy that
would make you lose your soul?"
Angel,(coolly) That'd be between me and her.
Riley,Where do you think you're going?
Angel,Going to see an old girlfriend.
Riley,"Oh, you really think I'm gonna let that happen?"
Angel,You think you're gonna stop me?
Riley,I surely do.
Buffy,Angel.
Angel,Hi. Can I come in?
Buffy,(softly) I guess.
Angel,"Uh, I need a little more than that."
Buffy,Oh. Um . . . come in.
Buffy,(stoic) You're hurt.
Angel,You too.
Buffy,I'll live.
Buffy,You want to tell me who ran your face into that doorknob?
Angel,Not really. It's not world-in-peril stuff.
Buffy,"Let me guess. (a touch of venom) You thought of something
else really hurtful to say and, well, you couldn't tell me on the phone
because the funniest part is that look on my face--"
Angel,"Buffy, please. I really don't have a lot of time."
Buffy,(concerned) What's going on?
Riley,(pissed) I told you you weren't coming near her.
Buffy,(pissed) You've got to be kidding me. This is why you came?
Angel,No. This was accident.
Buffy,"(very pissed) Running a car into a tree is an accident!
Running your fist into somebody's face is a plan! Please, explain
this to me!"
Angel,(calmly) Put that gun down.
Riley,"It's pretty much all I got left, so I'm thinking not.
He attacked four of my men, Buffy. I think he's up to his old tricks."
Buffy,He won't hurt anybody. (to Angel) Tell him.
Angel,(with contained violence) Might hurt you.
Riley,Please try.
Angel,Heh. Some threat. You can barely stand.
Riley,Trigger finger feels okay.
Angel,(sideglance to Buffy) You actually sleep with this guy?
Buffy,"Okay, stop it!"
Buffy,"Okay, that's enough! I see one more display of testosterone
poisoning and I will personally put you both in the hospital!"
Buffy,(challengingly) Anybody think I'm exaggerating?
Angel,He started--
Buffy,(softly) Riley. (glances at his gun)
Riley,"I'm sorry. (he holsters it) Just wanted to know that you
were safe."
Buffy,(gently) I need to talk to Angel for a minute.
Riley,(exasperated) What?
Buffy,"Riley, please."
Riley,"(quietly firm) I'm not leaving this room. (crosses his arms)
I mean it."
Riley,Not moving a muscle.
Buffy,"(angry) Okay. I come to see you, to help you, and you treat
me like I'm just . . . your ex."
Angel,"Well, technically--"
Buffy,"Shut up! And then you order me out of *your* city
and then you come here and start pounding on my boyfriend?! I would really
like to know what the HELL are you trying to do?!.
 Angel: I was trying to make things better."
Angel,"Heh. Well. (chuckles) It's a . . . going pretty
good, don't you think?"
Buffy,(smiling) Swell.
Angel,"You know-- heh. (seriously) I couldn't leave it like that.
The way I spoke to you-- I came to apologize. I . . I had no right."
Buffy,And Riley?
Angel,"I got jumped by some soldiers. He came in in the
middle. And wasn't real forthcoming with the benefit of the doubt."
Buffy,Put yourself in his place.
Angel,I get it.
Buffy,"Look . . . You weren't entirely wrong, what you said in
L.A. (she meets his eyes) We don't live in each other's worlds anymore.
I had no right to barge in on yours and make judgments."
Angel,I'm still sorry.
Buffy,Thank you.
Angel,"And, next time . . I'll apologize by phone. (Buffy laughs
softly) Uh, things are pretty tense around here."
Buffy,They really are.
Angel,Can I do anything?
Buffy,"Honestly . . . I think the best thing you can do right
now is--"
Angel,(understandingly) Okay.
Buffy,It means a lot that you came.
Angel,"Oh, and . . . Riley."
Buffy,Yeah?
Angel,I don't like him.
Buffy,Thank you.
Spike,"(happily) Now that . . . (crushes can and throws it down) was
fun!"
ADAM,You were successful?
Spike,"(""no problem"" scoff) Easier than I'd thought it'd be, too."
ADAM,You're sure?
Spike,"(scoffs) Feel it in my bones. It's, uh . .
called the Yoko Factor."
Spike,Don't tell me you've never heard of the Beatles?
ADAM,"I have. (stands) I like ""Helter Skelter."""
Spike,"What a surprise. The point is, they were once a real
powerful group. It's not a stretch to say they ruled the world.
And when they broke up everyone blamed Yoko, but the fact is the group
split itself apart, she just happened to be there. And you know how
it is with kids. They go off to college, they grow apart. Way
of the world."
ADAM,"So you separated the Slayer from her friends. I'm
pleased."
Spike,"Well . . since we've got all our ducks in a row and not
talking to each other . . guess it's time for the grand plan, huh?
You know the one where I get the chipectomy. You got everything you
need, right?"
ADAM,No. There's one more thing.
Buffy,(softly) How bad are you hurt?
Riley,Dunno yet. Night's still young.
Buffy,"(mournful) Riley, I have to tell you something."
Riley,Figured.
Buffy,Maybe you want to sit down.
Riley,I'm fine.
Buffy,"Riley, I--"
Riley,(insistent) Wait. Me first.
Riley,"Buffy . . . I feel like we've gotten really close.
At least I thought we had. I don't know much about Angel (Buffy lowers
her eyes) or your relationship with him . . but . . . all I ask is . .
if you're gonna break heart, do it fast."
Buffy,What? You think that Angel and I . . .
Riley,Didn't you?
Buffy,"No. Of course not. How can you even ask me
that?"
Riley,(sighs) I don't know. Xander said--
Buffy,"Xander?! Oh, he's the deadest man in Deadonia."
Riley,"No. It's not his fault. I prodded and he explained
how Angel went bad. The, uh, trigger."
Buffy,(quietly) Oh.
Riley,"And, uh (chuckles) after that, I went a little nuts!
You know? I mean . . . On the one hand . . I should believe in us.
But on the other . . Sometimes things happen between exes and when I saw
that he was bad. . ."
Buffy,He's . . not bad.
Riley,"Seriously? That's . . a good day? (Buffy rolls her
eyes in confirmation) Well, there you go. Even when he's good he's
all Mister . . Billowy Coat King of Pain and girls really--"
Buffy,"Riley, stop."
Riley,See? Nuts.
Buffy,"Have I ever given you any reason to feel that you can't
trust me?"
Riley,No.
Buffy,Then why with the crazy?
Riley,"(meaningfully) Because I'm so in love with you I can't think
straight."
Buffy,Tell me about it.
Buffy,"Riley. (pulls away) I still have to tell you something.
And there's no easy way--"
Riley,Just say it.
Buffy,(a beat) Forrest is dead.
Buffy,"(gently) I'm so sorry. There was a fight. Adam killed
him. I barely got away. I know that there's nothing I can say
that's gonna make this better. But we will find this thing and destroy
it."
Riley,(somber) I have to go.
Buffy,Are you sure?
Riley,I have to go now.
Willow,(a tad frustrated) It's still encrypted.
Tara,"(to Buffy) Well, Willow's working really hard on it."
Buffy,"Okay, well, how long before you . . un-crypt it?"
Willow,"Hours. Days maybe. Anyone suggesting months
would not be accused of crazy talk."
Giles,"What ever happened to Latin? At least when that made
no sense, the church approved."
Buffy,"(slightly impatient) I can't just wait around, Will. The
disk is no good to me unless you crack it soon."
Anya,"Hey! We worked really hard getting that. Xander
delivered clothing."
Giles,Church approved.
Buffy,"Sorry, you guys, but we're on a clock here. Okay,
Adam was at that cave so maybe he was there for a reason? I-I can--I
can go back, scope it out, track him if I have to."
Willow,"(sarcastic) Right. (stands moving to the living room)
And then maybe you'll get lucky and he'll still be there and he can rip
your arms off for you? (sternly) Buffy, you can't go back alone."
Giles,"You never train with me anymore. He's gonna kick
your ass."
Buffy,(shocked) Giles.
Giles,"Sorry. Was it a bit honest? (drunken grin) Terribly
sorry."
Xander,"(standing) So she doesn't go alone. (turns to him) Giles, weapons
all around."
Buffy,"You're not going, Xander."
Buffy,Y-you'd get hurt.
Xander,"(as if expecting this) Oh. Okay. You and Willow
go do the superpower thing, I'll stay behind and putt around the Batcave
with crusty old Alfred here. (with a thumb to Giles)"
Giles,"Ah-ah, no. I am no Alfred, sir. No, you forget.
Alfred had a job."
Buffy,Willow is not going either. I'm doing it alone.
Willow,"(still sarcastic) Oh, great. And then when you have your
new ""no arms"" we can all say ""Gee, it's a good thing we weren't there getting
in the way of that!"""
Xander,"Right! Maybe we can help in other ways? (to Buffy)
Want some fighting pants, Buff? I can get ya some new fighting pants!"
Buffy,"You guys, this isn't helping."
Willow,"Oh, wow! We're already getting in the way.
We're pretty good at this, Xander, huh?"
Xander,"Right. I'm so good at it you might have to ship
me off to the Army to get me out of the way!"
Buffy,The Army?
Xander,"You didn't think I knew about that, did you? You
two talking about me behind my back."
Buffy,"Us talking about *you*? How about you telling Riley
every last detail of my life with Angel?"
Willow,"And besides, when is there any ""us two?"" You two
are the two who are the two. I'm the other one."
Xander,"Uh-huh. But maybe that all changes when I'm doing
sit-ups over at Fort Dix?"
Giles,Fort Dix?
Buffy,Are you drunk?
Giles,"(happily) Yes. Quite a bit, actually."
Buffy,"Well, stop it! (to Xander and Willow) This is stupid."
Xander,"Stupid? So you finally have the guts to say it to
my face?"
Buffy,"I didn't say you were stupid! So . . stop being an
idiot and let me fix this!"
Buffy,"Okay, I need you. I need both of you. All the
time! Just . . not now. Adam is very dangerous."
Willow,"Wait. How do you need me, really?"
Buffy,"You're . . good with the computer stuff. (Willow accepts
that) Usually. (Willow glares at her) And-and there's the witch stuff."
Willow,"(accusingly) Witch stuff? What exactly do you mean by
""witch stuff?"""
Buffy,"You guys, what is happening? This is crazy!"
Giles,"Oh, no, it's not. (moves to his desk) It's all finally
making perfect sense and I'm not going to miss a moment of it."
Tara,You think this will go on for a while?
Anya,(nonchalant) Hard to say.
Tara,Nice bathroom.
Anya,(nodding) Like the tile.
Xander,"And if I did join the Army, I'd be great! You know
why? 'Cause they might give me a job that couldn't be done by any
well-trained border collie."
Giles,That's it. I'm going to bed.
Willow,"No, you'd do wonderful in the Army. Hey, do you
think the umbilical cord between you and Anya can stretch that far?"
Xander,I knew it! I knew you hated her!
Willow,"Look, I'm not the one being judgmental here. I'll
leave that territory to you and Buffy."
Buffy,"Judgmental? If I was anymore open-minded about the
choices you two make my whole brain would fall out!"
Xander,"(to Willow) Oh! And superior. Don't forget that.
(to Buffy) Just because you're better than us doesn't mean that you can
be all superior!"
Buffy,"You guys, stop this! What happened to you today?"
Willow,"It's not today! Buffy, things have been wrong for
a while! Don't you see that?"
Buffy,What do you mean wrong?
Willow,"Well, they certainly haven't been right, since Tara.
We have to face it. You can't handle Tara being my girlfriend."
Xander,"No! It was bad before that! (he steps out in between
them again) Since you two went off to college and forgot about me!
Just left me in the basement to-- (turns on Willow in shock) Tara's your
girlfriend?"
Giles,(from upstairs) Bloody hellll!
Buffy,"Enough! All I know is you want to help, right?
Be part of the team?"
Willow,(unison) I don't know anymore.
Xander,(unison) Really not wanted.
Buffy,"(raising her voice) No! No, you said you wanted to go.
So let's go! All of us. We'll walk into that cave with you
two attacking me and the funny drunk drooling on my shoe! Hey!
Hey, maybe that's the secret way of killing Adam?!"
Xander,Buffy . . .
Buffy,"(hurt and angry) Is that it? Is that how you can help?
(a beat) You're not answering me! How can you possibly help?"
Buffy,"(somberly) So . . . I guess I'm starting to understand why there's
no ancient prophecy about a Chosen One . . and her friends."
Buffy,"If I need help, I'll go to someone I can count on."
ADAM,I've been waiting for you.
Riley,And now I'm here.
