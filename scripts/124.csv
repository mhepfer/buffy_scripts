She goes through an   interior door and jumps down to the next level. Two people are chasing her.   They look suspiciously like the robed men from episode 7x01 &quot;Lessons&quot;.

XANDER,"<br>  Yes, and no, with an emphasis on the yes. But, at least then I was dating."

XANDER,<br>  That leaving her at the altar thing?
BUFFY,"<br>  Yeah, that one. That's not something you bounce right back from."
XANDER,"<br>  Sure it is. She bounced back to being a vengeance demon, and I bounced back   to being a dateless nerd."
DAWN,<br>  Do you guys talk at all?
XANDER,"<br>  I've seen her at the Bronze a couple of times. I guess there's a lot of scorned   women there, making vengeance wishes on their exes."
BUFFY,<br>  (Southern accent) I know that's where I go to get my scorn on.
DAWN,<br>  You guys need to really to ease up with the whole dating demons thing.

BUFFY,<br>  What if they don't? Should I panic?
PRINCIPAL,"<br>  You'll be surprised, Buffy. You're the youngest, and, uh, least stuffy member   of this faculty. I think the students are gonna want to come in and talk to   you. And when they do, don't evaluate them. Just listen. They need to feel like   there's someone around here who actually understands them."
BUFFY,<br>  Can I give detention?
PRINCIPAL,"<br>  OK by me. A little authority can be a wonderful thing. Just remember that while   you are here to help, you're not here to be their friend. Trust me, you open   that door, and these students will eat you alive."
BUFFY,"<br>  You heard about Principal Flutie, right?"
PRINCIPAL,<br>  Hmm?
BUFFY,<br>  Forget it.
PRINCIPAL,"<br>  OK then. And, Buffy, relax. There's only three things these kids understand:   the boot, the bat, and the bastinada. (chuckles)"

BUFFY,"<br>  Wooden rod to slap the soles of the feet in Turkish prisons, but if made with   the correct wood makes an awesome Billy club."
PRINCIPAL,<br>  I think you're gonna fit in just fine. Is there something else?
BUFFY,"<br>  Um, yeah. Uh, just one more thing. (stands) I was, uh, just curious, you know,   uh&#151;not that I'm not grateful or anything. But, uh, I guess I was wondering   why I&#151;"
PRINCIPAL,<br>  Have this job?
BUFFY,<br>  I still haven't finished college.
PRINCIPAL,<br>  I know.
BUFFY,<br>  Was it my sparkling personality? Or maybe you enjoyed my work at the Doublemeat   Palace?
PRINCIPAL,"<br>  I'm a vegetarian. These students need someone around here who understands them,   and I need someone who understands these students. Why? Is there something about   you that I don't know that maybe I should?"
BUFFY,<br>  Nothing I can think of.
PRINCIPAL,"<br>  Oh, if you'll excuse me. First catch of the day. I'll be in my office if you   need me."
BUFFY,<br>  Thanks. I'm just gonna have a look around. Get to know the place. Make sure   it's all... school-like.

BUFFY,<br>  Not your fault.
SPIKE,"<br>  Hold the torch, would you?"
BUFFY,"<br>  Look, this... us working together&#151;it's not a way for us to get back together,   if that's what you want."
SPIKE,"<br>  It's not. Look, I can't blame you for being all skittish."
BUFFY,<br>  Skittish? That's not a word I would use for it. You tried to rape me. I don't   have the words.
SPIKE,"<br>  Neither do I. I can't say sorry. Can't use forgive me. All I can say is: Buffy,   I've changed."
BUFFY,<br>  I believe you.
SPIKE,"<br>  Well, that's something."
BUFFY,"<br>  I just don't know what you've changed into. You come back to town. You make   with the big surprises. Twice. I don't know what your game is, Spike, but I   know there's something you're not telling me."
SPIKE,"<br>  You're right. There is. (stands) But we're not best friends anymore, so too   bad for me. I'm not sharing. We've been through things. The end of the world   and back. I can be useful 'cause, honestly, I've got nothing better to do. Make   use of me if you want. (gesturing to the sidewalk)And there's nothing here.   Just a bit of slime. Mounds of displaced dirt and such. Whatever our beastie   is, he's gone."

NANCY,"<br>  No, actually, I'm hitting on you."

NANCY,<br>  I just...

NANCY,<br>  I don't think so. I just&#151;I don't think I can take any more of this.
XANDER,<br>  Two attacks in the same night. I'm starting to think it's not coincidence.
NANCY,"<br>  Oh, sure. Why not? A monster trying to kill me. It's just the thing that was   missing to make my life absolutely perfect. Uhh! Ronnie would love this. Boy!"
XANDER,<br>  Right. Who's Ronnie?
NANCY,"<br>  Oh, um, only my psycho ex-boyfriend that I've been trying to get rid of for   the past few weeks. I almost prefer the monster. Ronnie was, um... trouble."
XANDER,<br>  Uh-huh. And I'm just curious. Was this Ronnie guy a borrowing money kind of   trouble or was he a raising demon trouble kind of guy?
NANCY,"<br>  Ronnie? He couldn't. He just... &quot;he was an abusive bastard&quot; is the   catchy headline. And he'd just show up, even after... you know the feeling that   you get when your ex is constantly ruining every part of your life, and it just   doesn't stop?"
XANDER,<br>  Yes.
NANCY,<br>  And you get so tired of feeling helpless that all you can do is just wish that   it would stop?
