Cordelia,I think we should get a limo.
Xander,A limo?
Cordelia,Yeah!
Xander,"A big, expensive limo?"
Willow,"That sounds like fun! And it is our last Homecoming Dance, so  maybe we should make a big deal of it."
Xander,You wanna talk fun? Public bus. You meet the funnest people.
Xander,"Back me up here, Oz."
Oz,"Well, if it's a dollar issue, we could all take my van."
Cordelia,Van? The Homecoming Queen doesn't go to the dance in a van.  Use your head.
Xander,"(to Cordelia) Well, technically, you haven't been elected  yet... (gets a look from her) Although you certainly and without a doubt  will be. (to the others) Who else likes a limo?"
Willow,"(smiles) A private limo! It, it is pretty... (nudges up to Oz)  cuddlesome. (looks toward Buffy) And if we all split the cost..."
Buffy,"(comes out of her reverie) Um... maybe. You know, if I go and  all."
Willow,"Why wouldn't you go? You already have your tickets. (Scott  approaches) I mean, unless you don't have a da... (notices Scott) ...ay  o-or two to think about it. We should all think about it."
Cordelia,(confused) What's going on here? Did Scott not ask her to the  Homecoming Dance yet?
Buffy,"(embarrassed) Thanks, Cordelia. Humiliation's really good for my  color."
Scott,"(unsure) Oh, um... well, no. I just... I assumed that you would  think it was corny or something, but I-I'm in... I mean, you know, if  you are, if you want to."
Buffy,"Uh, sure... I do. You know, i-if you want to."
Scott,"Well, I do if you want to."
Oz,(smiles) The judges will accept that as a 'yes'.
Scott,(to Buffy) Do you want me to get you another drink?
Buffy,"Um... no, actually. Uh... I-I'm a little tired. I think I'm  gonna call it a night. But I'm excited about the dance. (smiles)"
Scott,"Me, too."
Buffy,I-it's just me. (holds out the bag) Here.
Buffy,How are you feeling?
Angel,It hurts... less.
Buffy,Good.
Buffy,I haven't... told Giles and the others that... you're back.
Angel,(quietly) Giles...
Buffy,And I'm not going to. They wouldn't understand that you're...  better. A-a-and I'm gonna keep helping you get better. It's just that  everything's different now. I'm a senior. I'm really working harder in  school. (smirks slightly) I'm even thinking about college. A-and I'm  involved with someone.
Buffy,"His name is Scott. He's a nice, solid guy. He makes me happy...  and that's what I need: someone I can count on."
Scott,I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Buffy,(taken aback) You don't? (confused) When did this happen? Where  was I?
Scott,"Buffy, it's just... Before we were going out, you, you seemed  so... full of life, like a force of nature. Now you just seem distracted  all the time, and..."
Buffy,"(interrupts) Yeah, I know, it's... I'm getting better. Honest.  In fact, from here on, you are gonna see a drastic distraction  reduction."
Buffy,'Drastic distraction reduction.' Try saying that ten times fast.
Scott,I'm really sorry.
Boss,Is that her?
Trick,"(steps into view) In the nubile flesh, my friend."
Trick,That's the target.
Secretary,The Mayor will see you now.
Allan,"I'm sorry to bother you, sir. (closes the door behind him)"
Allan,"(steps toward the desk) Well, I-I'm not sure how serious this  is, but, uh, (opens the folder) they were spotted in town three days  ago. (lays the open folder on the desk) I've just been informed.  Frederick and Hans Gruenstahler, uh, (the Mayor picks up a copy of the  Interpol warrant) wanted in Germany for capital murder, terrorism, uh,  (the Mayor sniffs the paper) the bombing of Flight 1402... Uh, I should  have brought it to your attention sooner, but I'd, I'd wanted to...  (flustered by the Mayor's sniffing) confirm..."
Allan,(raises his eyebrows) Sir?
Allan,"Of course, sir. I-I mean, I, I washed them, but..."
Allan,I'll take care of it. (smiles weakly)
Willow,"You have to help me pick an outfit. I wanna wear something that  makes Oz go, 'Oh.' (grins)"
Xander,No problem. I got the tux goin' on. I'm gonna look hot if it  even remotely fits.
Xander,Whatcha doin'?
Cordelia,(startles and faces him) Checking out the I-laughingly-use- the-phrase competition.
Cordelia,"Holly Charleston: nice girl, brain dead, doesn't have a  prayer."
Cordelia,"Michelle Blake: open to all mankind, especially those with a  letterman's jacket and a car. (looks at Xander, concerned) She could  give me a run. (crosses her arms)"
Willow,Where's Buffy? (Oz looks around) She's gonna miss the yearbook  pictures.
Xander,Buffy and Faith are in the library getting all *sweaty*.
Cordelia,(corrects him) They're training.
Xander,(gives her a look) I stand by my phrase.
Oz,I don't think she was here the day they announced them. Did anybody  tell her?
Cordelia,"Oh, I'll tell her now. I have to go to the nurse's office for  an ice pack anyway."
Xander,(puts his hand on her arm) Did you hurt yourself?
Cordelia,"(smiles) No, silly. (nudges him) It shrinks the pores! (walks  off)"
Faith,"Oh, man! Guys should break up with you more often."
Buffy,"Gee, thank you. (heads toward the book cage)"
Faith,"(follows) No, I mean it. You really got some quality rage going.  Really gives you an edge. (sets down the pads)"
Buffy,(picks up her jacket) Edge Girl. (pulls it on) Just what I  always wanted to be.
Faith,"(wipes her cheek with a towel) Well, screw him, alright? You  move on, and... you party heavily, and you'll be fine. I mean, you're  still going to that dance, right?"
Buffy,(opens a juice bottle) Maybe. (takes a swallow)
Faith,You got the tix already. Why don't we go together?
Buffy,(closes the bottle) I don't know about that. (smiles)
Faith,"Come on. We'll find a couple studs, we'll use 'em and... discard  'em. That's always fun. (nods and takes a swig of her own drink)"
Buffy,"Okay, I'm in. Not the stud-using part, though. (smirks and rolls  her eyes) Or... probably not."
Cordelia,"Uh, Bobby! Mashad! (smiles and giggles) You don't phone, you  don't write... (makes eyes at them) Where's the love?"
Buffy,"Ms. Moran? (the teacher looks up) Hi! (smiles) I'm so glad that  I ran into you. (they walk slowly) Um, I had this little incident last  year of getting kicked out of school. And I'm back now, though, I've  done all of my makeup tests, but I still need one written recommendation  from a teacher. I think the word that Principal Snyder used was  'glowing'. (smiles awkwardly) Uh, to put in my file so I can prove that  I belong here."
Buffy,"(taken aback) Buffy. B-Buffy Summers. (Ms. Moran tries to  remember) Third row. I sat by the window. Uh, your class: Contemporary  American Heroes from Amelia Earhart to Maya Angelou. The class that  changed my life?"
Buffy,Buffy?
Cordelia,Hi. I hope you'll consider me for Homecoming Queen.
Buffy,"I can't believe it. My favorite teacher, and she didn't even  remember who I was. I'm like a non-person. (to Oz) Am I invisible?  (waves her hand in front of him) Can you see me?"
Oz,Big as life.
Buffy,"At Hemery, I was Prom Princess, I was Fiesta Queen, I was on the  cheerleading squad. And the yearbook was, like, a story of me. Now it's  senior year, and I'm going to be one crappy picture on one-eighth of one  crappy page."
Xander,"(looks up from his plate) Uh, no, actually, you're not."
Buffy,What do you mean?
Xander,"Well, you, uh, missed the picture-taking."
Buffy,(eyes wide with surprise) When? (looks at Oz) Why?
Oz,We did 'em yesterday.
Willow,Didn't Cordelia tell you?
Cordelia,"Thanks for your support. (smiles and turns around) Buffy, you  look so cute in that outfit."
Buffy,I'm not voting for you.
Cordelia,(curtly) Then make it snappy.
Buffy,How come you didn't tell me they were doing the yearbook  pictures? (crosses her arms)
Cordelia,"Didn't I? Oh, I guess I forgot. What's the big?"
Buffy,"It's just... (exhales) You could've thought about somebody else  for thirty seconds, that's all."
Cordelia,"Hey, I am under a *lot* of pressure here."
Buffy,"Oh, yeah, campaigning. Rough gig."
Cordelia,What would you know about it? Just because you were Guacamole  Queen when you were three doesn't mean you understand how this works.
Buffy,"Obviously, it involves handing out entirely lame flyers."
Cordelia,No. It involves being part of this school and having actual  friends.
Cordelia,"Now, if it was about monsters, blood, and innards, then you'd  be a shoo-in. I'd like to see *you* try to win the crown."
Buffy,You would?
Buffy,Then you will.
Cordelia,What does that mean?
Buffy,"(faces her) I'm gonna show you how it's done. I'm gonna run for  Homecoming Queen, and I'm going to win."
Cordelia,This is starting to be sad.
Buffy,"Sorry, Cordy, but you have no idea who you're messing with."
Cordelia,What? The Slayer?
Buffy,I'm not talking about the Slayer. I'm talking about Buffy.  You've awakened the Prom Queen within. And that crown is going to be  mine.
Trick,"Competition. Competition is a beautiful thing. It makes us  strive. It... makes us accomplish. Occasionally, it makes us kill. We  all have the desire to win. (walks through the room) Whether we're  human... (gestures to three men) vampire..."
Trick,"...and whatever the hell you are, my brother. You got them  spiny-looking head things. I ain't never seen that before."
Kulak,"I am Kulak, of the Miquot Clan."
Trick,"Isn't that nice. (continues walking) Point is, you're all here  for the same reason."
Lyle,"Well, it sure ain't no philosophy class, now, is it?"
Trick,"Mr. Gorch, my account statement says that your deposit has not  yet been made."
Lyle,"Well, me and Candy... we blowin' our whole honeymoon stash on  this little game here."
Trick,(unimpressed) They're dirty.
Lyle,(smiles) They're nonconsecutive.
Trick,"(to everyone) The games will begin in a few days' time. The  first target, Buffy, you've all seen. The second, Faith, is... a little  more elusive. But they will both be together and ready for the killing,  and that is a money-back guarantee."
Trick,"Ladies, gentlemen, spiny-headed looking creatures, welcome to  SlayerFest '98!"
Willow,What do you think of this?
Xander,(shrugs) Nice. (smiles)
Willow,"It's my first big dance, you know? (unbuttons her blouse)  (smiles) Where there's a boy and a band... and not just me alone in my  room pretending that there's a boy and a band."
Lyrics,<I>I didn't come this far</I>
Willow,(picks up another outfit) I just want it to be...
Xander,Special. That's why I spared no expense on the tux.
Willow,"The tux? I thought you, uh, borrowed it from your cousin Rigby."
Lyrics,<I>For you to make this hard for me.</I>
Xander,"(struggling with his tie) Expense to my pride, Will. They're  our only relations with money, and they shun us... as they should."
Lyrics,<I>And now you want to ask me 'how'?</I>
Willow,What do you think about this?
Lyrics,<I>It's like / How does your heart beat?</I>
Xander,(looks and nods) Nice.
Lyrics,<I>Why do you breathe?</I>
Lyrics,<I>How does your heart beat?</I>
Xander,What?
Lyrics,<I>And why do you breathe?</I>
Willow,(smiling) I was just...
Lyrics,<I>Why did you come here?</I>
Willow,Remember the eighth-grade cotillion? (giggles) You had that  clip-on?
Lyrics,<I>You weren't invited</I>
Xander,"Hey, I was pretty stylin' with a clip-on."
Lyrics,<I>And you're on the outside</I>
Willow,"And now here we are, and it's... Homecoming. (concentrates on  the tie)"
Xander,"Yeah, we should face it, Will."
Lyrics,<I>Stay on the outside.</I>
Xander,"You and I are gonna be in neighboring rest homes while I come  over so you can adjust my, um..."
Lyrics,<I>And now you want to ask me 'why'?</I>
Xander,"My, uh... Well, I can't think of anything that's not really  gross."
Lyrics,<I>It's like / How does your heart beat?</I>
Lyrics,<I>And how do you cry?</I>
Xander,"So, uh... you and Oz."
Lyrics,<I>How does your heart beat?</I>
Xander,"How do I put this? (buttons the vest) Are we on first, second,  or, uh... ye gods?"
Willow,"That's none of your business, Alexander Harris."
Lyrics,<I>And there are some things that I like to figure out</I>
Xander,"(smiles) Ooo, rounding second. (reaches for his jacket)"
Willow,(huffs) You don't know that. What about you and Cordelia?
Lyrics,<I>There are some things that I can do without</I>
Xander,"(pulls on the tuxedo jacket) Oh, a gentleman never talks about  his conquests."
Willow,"Oh, yeah? (steps out from behind the screen) Well, since when  did you become a..."
Lyrics,<I>You and your letters are gone forever</I>
Willow,...gentleman? (smiles and giggles)
Willow,"Uh, I know. 'Nice.'"
Xander,I was gonna go with 'gorgeous'. (steps toward her)
Willow,"(smiles) Really? (steps toward him) You, too. I-in a guy way."
Lyrics,<I>With all the things that you could be</I>
Xander,(smiles back and draws a breath) Oz is very lucky.
Willow,(smiling) So is Cordelia... i-in a girl way.
Lyrics,<I>You never could learn how to be me.</I>
Willow,I don't know if I can dance in this. I don't know if I can  dance!
Xander,Come on. Piece of cake.
Xander,Here.
Lyrics,<I>And now you want to ask me 'how'?</I>
Xander,"Well, that seems to, um..."
Lyrics,<I>It's like / How does your heart beat? / Why do you breathe?</I>
Willow,Yeah. This shouldn't be a... problem.
Lyrics,<I>How does your heart beat?</I>
Xander,No.
Lyrics,<I>Why do you breathe?</I>
Xander,No problem.
Lyrics,<I>How does your heart beat? / Why do you breathe?</I>
Lyrics,<I>How do you breathe?</I>
Xander,(points at her) That didn't just happen!
Willow,"No! (gestures nervously) I mean, it did, but it didn't!"
Xander,Because I respect you. And Oz. And I would never...
Willow,"(furrows her brow) I would never, either! I-it must be the  clothes. I-it's a fluke."
Xander,"It's a clothes fluke, that's what it is. And there'll be no  more fluking."
Willow,Not ever.
Xander,We gotta get out of these clothes!
Willow,Right now!
Xander,"Oh, I didn't mean..."
Willow,"I didn't... me, either!"
Buffy,A campaign is like a war. It's won or lost in the trenches.
Buffy,"Holly, Michelle, and our real competition, Cordelia, all have  big head starts. (sets down the pointer) Speaking of big heads, if I had  a watermelon as big as Cordelia's, I'd be rich."
Buffy,Waits for laugh...
Buffy,"Okay, you're right. Making fun of the competition only makes me  seem petty. Now, this is just like any other popularity contest. I've  done this before. The only difference being this time, I'm not actually  popular. Although, I'm not exactly unpopular. A lot of people came to my  welcome home party."
Willow,But they were killed by zombies.
Buffy,"(points at her) Good point. Okay, (steps up to them) here's the  plan. Willow, I need you to make a database. See who's for us, who's on  the fence and where our real crisis areas are. Oz, you take the fringe:  musicians, those not normally inclined to vote. Xander, what..."
Buffy,"Uh, Cordelia... Okay, look. I know this is a little awkward, but  I don't see any reason why we all can't get along during this campaign  time. (Cordelia shrugs and nods) I mean, we're... almost friends, and...  we are all riding together in the limo."
Cordelia,"Yeah, great. Willow, how's that database coming?"
Willow,"(looks down in shame) Uh, it's... just about done. (sighs)"
Cordelia,(insistently) Xander?
Xander,(whips his head around to face her) I got your new flyers.  (smiles thinly)
Cordelia,Let's get cracking.
Xander,(to Buffy) She's my girlfriend. (goes to Cordelia)
Willow,It's just that... she needs it so much more than you do.
Oz,"As Willow goes, so goes my nation."
Cordelia,"Thanks for what you said, Buffy. I think we're getting along  great. Don't you?"
Giles,Seems like a lot of fuss for... one little title.
Buffy,"Well, you know, it's no fun if you don't try your best. (takes a  drink)"
Giles,As long as fun is still in the mix.
Buffy,(smiling) Sure! It's not like anyone takes it that seriously.
Lyrics,<I>Superman or Clark Kent</I>
Lyrics,<I>I don't wanna walk 'round in their shoes</I>
Lyrics,<I>'Cause I don't know whose side I'm on</I>
Lyrics,<I>I don't know my right from wrong</I>
Lyrics,<I>I don't know where I'm going to</I>
Lyrics,<I>I don't know about you</I>
Lyrics,<I>I'll be the rain falling on your fire escape</I>
Buffy,Sorry.
Scott,Here.
Lyrics,<I>And I may not be the man you want me to</I>
Scott,(looks at the flyers) I heard you were doing this.
Buffy,Uh... yeah. It's just something to pass the time.
Lyrics,<I>I can be myself</I>
Buffy,"It's silly, really."
Lyrics,<I>How 'bout you?</I>
Scott,"I don't think so. For what it's worth, you have my vote."
Buffy,"No, I don't want you to feel... (reconsiders and smiles) Thank  you."
Lyrics,<I>I don't wanna make you mad</I>
Lyrics,<I>I don't wanna meet your dad</I>
Lyrics,<I>I don't wanna be your dream come true</I>
Lyrics,<I>'Cause I don't know just what I've found</I>
Lyrics,<I>I don't know my sky from ground</I>
Lyrics,<I>I don't know where I'm going to</I>
Lyrics,<I>I don't know about you</I>
Buffy,Hey.
Willow,"(jumpy) Hi! How are you? You good? You look good. Anything new?  (smiles) Hey, did I mention you look good?"
Buffy,"Willow, it's okay that you're helping Cordelia. We're best  friends. I'm not gonna hold it against you."
Willow,"(whining) No, I'm not a friend. I'm a rabid dog who should be  shot! But there're forces at work here! Dark, incomprehensible forces."
Buffy,"And I'm sure they're more important than all we've been through  together, or... the number of times that I've saved your life."
Willow,(looks at her imploringly) What do you want?
Buffy,Fifteen minutes alone on your computer with Cordelia's database.
Willow,(gives in with a squeaky voice) 'Kay.
Buffy,(smiles) Good! Oh! (sits also)
Buffy,"So, I spoke to the limo people, and we're all set."
Buffy,"They'll pick up Faith, then me, then swing by and get you guys.  Now, what's your database tell you about *my* weaknesses?"
Buffy,"You know, Jonathon, I've always felt a special bond between you  and me."
Jonathon,(with his mouth full) Cordelia gave me six bucks. (they stop  walking) That buys a *whole* lotta cupcakes. (takes another bite)
Cordelia,Are you kidding?
Cordelia,I've been doing the Vulcan death grip since I was four.
Buffy,"So you really are giving out money, huh?"
Cordelia,(turns to face her) Is that any more tacky than your faux  'I'm shy but deep' campaign posters?
Buffy,Yes.
Cordelia,This whole trying to be like me really isn't funny anymore.
Buffy,"I was *never* trying to be like you, and when was it funny?"
Cordelia,I don't see why your pathetic need to recapture your glory  days gives you the right to splinter my vote.
Buffy,(not believing what she's hearing) How can you think it's okay  to talk to people like this? Do you have parents?
Cordelia,Yeah. Two of them... unlike some people.
Buffy,"(completely flabbergasted) Your brain isn't even connected to  your mouth, is it?"
Cordelia,Why don't you do us both a favor and stay out of my way?
Buffy,Don't *ever* do that again.
Cordelia,"(jerks her hand away) You're sick, you know that?"
Xander,"Okay, let's not say something we'll, uh, regret later..."
Cordelia,(to Buffy) You crazy freak!
Buffy,Vapid whore!
Xander,...like that!
Cordelia,(incensed) What did you call me?!
Willow,This is just...
Willow,...the worst thing that's ever happened. Ever!
Xander,"I know. I know. It's just... when I look at you now, it's like  I'm seeing you for the first time."
Willow,I'm talking about Buffy and Cordelia.
Xander,"(yanks back his arm) Me, too."
Willow,"(sighs) What are we gonna do? I mean, we have to do something.  This is all our fault."
Xander,How do you get from 'chick fight' to 'our fault'?
Willow,"(flustered) Because: we felt so guilty about the fluke, we  overcompensated helping Cordelia, and we spun the whole group dynamic  out of orbit, and we're just a big meteor shower heading for Earth..."
Xander,"Okay, calm down. Let's just put our heads together and think of  something. (Willow nods) (takes a breath) Okay, one of us here is pretty  darn smart, and I am..."
Xander,"...just in Hell. I-I mean, I-I thought being a senior *at last*  and, and having a girlfriend *at last* would, would be a *good* thing.  Now, why wouldn't that be a good thing?"
Xander,What?
Willow,"Sometimes when you're falling to pieces, your mouth, (reaches  up with her hand) it just does the sweetest thing. (smiles)"
Willow,What are we gonna do?
Xander,We just have to get the two of them communicating.
Willow,I'm talking about us.
Buffy,What's going on here? Where's Faith?
Buffy,Well...
Buffy,They bought us corsages?
Cordelia,I took the orchid.
Buffy,(rolls her eyes) Okay.
Cordelia,I don't see what the big deal is.
Buffy,"I'm not making a big deal. You wanted the orchid, you got the  orchid."
Cordelia,It goes with my complexion better.
Buffy,It does have that sallow tint.
Buffy,Finally we're here.
Cordelia,"What is this? (loudly) Okay, guys, we've had enough of your  stupid little game!"
Buffy,What's massively wrong with this picture?
Trick,"Hello, ladies. Welcome to SlayerFest '98."
Trick,"What is a SlayerFest, you ask? Well, as in most of life, there's  the hunters and the hunted. Can you guess where you two fall? From the  beginning of this tape, you have exactly thirty seconds--(checks his  watch) no, that's seventeen now--to run for your lives. (smiles)"
Trick,Faith...
Trick,Buffy...
Trick,(smiling hugely) Have a nice death.
Cordelia,(to the woods around them) Hello! How stupid are you people?  (points at Buffy) She's a Slayer. (puts her hand to her chest) I'm a  Homecoming Queen!
Lyrics,<I>She flies from a blinding light / And spirals to my heart</I>
Faith,What are you two so mopey about?
Lyrics,<I>I try to find my mind to go / don't know where to start</I>
Xander,"(looks at her) Oh, we're not mopey. We're groovin'. (points at  the stage) On Oz's band. He's a great guy, Oz."
Lyrics,"<I>Won't ever, can't ever find my sanity</I>"
Willow,He wrote this song for me.
Lyrics,<I>Won't ever...</I>
Faith,"(to Willow, indicating behind them) Sleazebag! (huffs and walks  off)"
Lyrics,<I>...can't ever till I hear her calling for me</I>
Giles,We have to find Buffy. Something terrible's happened.
Lyrics,"<I>She knows that, she knows that</I>"
Giles,(smiles) Just kidding. Thought I'd give you a scare.
Lyrics,<I>She knows that side of me</I>
Giles,(sees Xander's sandwich) Are those finger sandwiches?
Lyrics,"<I>I can't help it, can't help it</I>"
Cordelia,"I have an idea. We talk to these people, we explain that I'm  not a Slayer, and they let me go."
Cordelia,Look out!
Buffy,Get down!
Buffy,That's gotta smart.
Buffy,"Now, I can let you out of that, or I can put a bullet in your  head. How many are there in this little game, and what are they packing?"
Buffy,That everybody?
Cordelia,Could I just ask you an *eensy* favor? Could you just tell  your friends that I'm not a Sl...
Lyrics,"<I>Just a little more, just a little more</I>"
Lyrics,<I>Just until I know what I'm feeling</I>
Faith,"Scott? There you are, honey!"
Lyrics,<I>Just a little more</I>
Faith,"Hey, good news."
Lyrics,<I>Just a little more / To find my sanity</I>
Faith,"(with lots of gesturing) The doctor says that the itching and  the swelling and the burning should clear up, (puts her hands on his  chest) but we gotta keep using the ointment."
Faith,Hi.
Lyrics,<I>She knows that side is calling back for me</I>
Scott,Uh...
Lyrics,<I>I've lost my mind / I never believe</I>
Giles,"I suspect the, uh, finger food contains... actual fingers."
Lyrics,<I>She knows that side...</I>
Giles,I-I-I think I'll retreat to the library until the coronation.
Lyrics,<I>...is calling back for me</I>
Giles,"I wanna be here when, when, when Buffy... Well, uh, however the  thing turns out for her."
Lyrics,<I>I lost my mind til she's calling for me</I>
Giles,"A-and that was a very fine thing you two did, putting Buffy and  Cordelia together."
Lyrics,<I>She's calling for me / She's calling for me</I>
Lyrics,"<I>She knows that, she knows that</I>"
Willow,We did one fine thing.
Lyrics,<I>She knows that side of me</I>
Xander,Yeah. They've been gone for a while. They must really be  getting' into it.
Lyrics,<I>I can't help it</I>
Buffy,We should be safe in here for a while. You need to find a  weapon.
Cordelia,(panting with fright) Safe? I'm not safe. I'm gonna die!
Buffy,"(shrugs) Yeah, you are if you just stand there."
Cordelia,"(sobbing) I'm never gonna be crowned Homecoming Queen. I'm  never gonna graduate from high school. I'm never gonna know if it's real  between me and Xander, or if it's just... (sobs) some temporary insanity  that made me think... (sobs) I loved him. (sobs) And now I'm never gonna  get the chance to tell him."
Buffy,"Yes, you are. We are gonna get out of here, and we are gonna  head back to the library, where Giles and the rest of the weapons live.  Then I'm gonna take out the rest of these guys just in time for you to  congratulate me on my *sweeping* victory as Homecoming Queen. (heads  back to a window)"
Cordelia,"I know what you're up to. (Buffy turns back to face her) You  think if you get me mad enough, I won't be so scared. And, hey! It's  working! Where's a damn weapon?"
Buffy,You really love Xander?
Cordelia,"Well, he kinda grows on you, like... a Chia Pet."
Buffy,That's it?
Cordelia,Just this and a telephone.
Buffy,A telephone. And you didn't think that'd be helpful?
Cordelia,"No, this is better for..."
Cordelia,Oh. (exhales)
Boss,You're about to see why Daniel Boone and that idiot demon are  creatures of the past... and why I am the future. I'm picking up a  signal.
Boss,They've got a phone!
Buffy,"If you get this message, Giles, get help and get out here..."
Buffy,Hello?
Cordelia,What happened?
Buffy,It went dead.
Kulak,Want me to cut that leg off?
Boss,Continue proceeding south ninety meters to vector three.
Buffy,"Giles, it's me... and Cordelia. We're in a cabin in Miller's  Woods, and we're in big trouble."
Cordelia,"Why is it every time I go somewhere with you, it always ends  in violence and terror?"
Buffy,(staring out a window) Welcome to my life.
Cordelia,I don't wanna be in your life. I wanna be in my life.
Buffy,"(looks back at her) Well, there's the door. (points with the  rifle) Please feel free to walk out at any time and live your life."
Cordelia,All I wanted was to be Homecoming Queen.
Buffy,"And that's all I wanted, too, Cordelia."
Buffy,I spent a year's allowance on this dress. (looks out again)
Cordelia,I don't even get why you care about Homecoming when you're  doing stuff like this.
Buffy,"Because this is all I do. This is what my life is. (lowers her  head and steps into the room) You couldn't understand. (shrugs) I just  thought... Homecoming Queen. (smiles) (Cordelia keeps respectfully  silent) I could pick up a yearbook someday and say, I was there. I went  to high school, I had friends, and... for one moment, I got to live in  the world. (smiles) And there'd be proof. Proof that I was chosen for  something other than this."
Buffy,Besides... (pumps the rifle) I look cute in a tiara.
Cordelia,Do you hear...
Buffy,"Cor, the gun!"
Buffy,Ooh!
Buffy,"Cordelia, the spatula."
Boss,Prepare to launch.
Boss,"Target's in range, ready your weapons. Y-axis fifty-three degrees  west by eight degrees south."
Cordelia,Buffy!
Boss,Launch!
Buffy,We gotta get back to the library.
Lyle,"Easy, darlin'. (nudges the weapon away) These things go through  you faster than Grandpa Pete's chili."
Candy,I want to do Buffy: my weddin' present for what happened to your  poor brother.
Lyle,Tector.
Candy,(impatient) When's she comin'?
Lyle,"(looks down at the floor) Well, he's her Watcher. She'll show...  just as soon as she gets rid of some of our competition."
Boss,"They're heading west, back into town."
Trick,They got away?
Boss,Temporarily.
Trick,"Well, give it up for the Slayers. They got character."
Trick,I'll take care of it.
Trick,"Evening, gentlemen. How may I help you?"
Trick,Excuse me! Anybody got a warrant here?
Buffy,"Jungle Bob and spike-head are down and out. We've lost the  Germans twice, but they seem to keep finding us. If we take them out and  the Gorches, we can still make Homecoming."
Cordelia,"Those animals! Hunting us down like poor defenseless... well,  animals."
Buffy,We just need to find Giles...
Cordelia,Buffy!
Lyle,Candy!
Lyle,"Oh, Candy..."
Lyle,I'm gonna kill both you Slayers for this! You hear me?
Cordelia,"I hear you, you redneck moron. You got a dress that goes with  that hat?"
Lyle,(furious) I'm gonna...
Cordelia,"Rip out my innards, play with my eyeballs, boil my brain and  eat it for brunch? Listen up, needle-brain. Buffy and I have taken out  four of your cronies, not to mention your girlfriend."
Lyle,WIFE!
Cordelia,"Whatever. The point is, I haven't even broken a sweat. See,  in the end, Buffy's just the runner-up. *I'm* the Queen. You get me mad,  (gets in his face and glares at him) what do you think I'm gonna do to  you?"
Lyle,Later.
Buffy,(to Cordelia) That should teach him to mistake you for a Slayer.
Giles,"Yes, I must admit I do feel partly responsible. I did give your  friends tacit approval to make the switch in the limousine."
Buffy,"Aw, it's okay. It gave Cor and I a chance to spend some quality  death time."
Cordelia,And we got these free corsages. (looks at hers)
Giles,"Oh, that's nice. Although I don't recall them mentioning  corsages."
Buffy,Jungle Bob... said that the Germans were hooked into a computer  system.
Buffy,And they're hooked into us.
Cordelia,"Oh, God, get rid of these things!"
Buffy,(to Giles) I need some wet toilet paper.
Cordelia,(sarcastically) Yeah! That'll help.
Boss,Transmitting coordinates now.
Boss,They're fifty feet away.
Boss,Axis six degrees by forty-three.
Boss,I have them both in range.
Boss,"I have the targets together, twenty feet north and stationary.  Final position is locked. Fire when ready."
Boss,Both targets seven degrees by thirty-five.
Boss,Adjust! Right ten degrees! Fire!
Boss,(smiles) I won!
Trick,"(ignores the hand) Yeah, hi, it's a pleasure. Where am I?"
Trick,"Well, clothes make the man."
Trick,Election year.
Trick,"If this is the part where you tell me that I don't fit in here  in your quiet little neighborhood, you can just skip it 'cause, see,  that all got old long before I became a vampire. Do you know what I'm  saying?"
Trick,"If this rebellious element means who I think it does, then that  problem may be taken care of this very night."
Trick,What if I don't wanna be a part of the team?
Devon,"Hey, guys, the moment we've all been waiting for."
Willow,They're gonna announce the Queen. Where are they? What's  keeping them?
Oz,I'm gonna go with mud wrestling.
Xander,"Oh, God! What did you two do to each other?"
Buffy,Long story.
Cordelia,Got hunted.
Buffy,Apparently not that long.
Buffy,"Tell you one thing, though: you don't wanna mess with Cordelia."
Xander,(laughs and gets a look from Cordelia) No.
Devon,"In this envelope, I hold the name of this year's Homecoming  Queen."
Cordelia,"After all that we've been through tonight, this whole who- gets-to-be-queen capade seems pretty..."
Buffy,Damn important.
Cordelia,"Oh, yeah."
Devon,And the winner is...
Devon,"Hey, I believe we have a first for Sunnydale High. We have a  tie."
Devon,The winners are Holly Charleston and Michelle Blake!
Michelle,I'm just so honored! (giggles)
Michelle,"I can't believe it! I mean, that you would pick me... or  us... out of every girl in the whole school! It's just... it's so  wonderful!"
Michelle,(starts to weep) I promised myself I'm not gonna cry...
