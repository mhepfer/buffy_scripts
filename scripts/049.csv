character,dialogue
Joyce,"Oh, honey, you're up. (turns back to the TV) Oh, it's just  terrible, isn't it?"
Wesley,I want you to look into this. Find out everything you can about  the murder of the Deputy Mayor.
Buffy,"(nervous and confused) But that's... I-I mean, that's... That's  not really our jurisdiction, is it?"
Faith,"(eerily calm) It's no big, B. We'll get into it if he wants."
Giles,"No, Buffy's right. The Deputy Mayor's murder was the result of  human malice. There's nothing supernatural about it."
Wesley,We don't know that for certain. (brightly) I say it merits  investigation.
Giles,"(gets up, walks around the table) Which I'm sure the police are  doing. Meantime, if you ask me, there are better uses for the Slayers'  time."
Wesley,(snootily) Ah. But I don't believe I did. (holds the daily  paper out to him) Ask you.
Giles,(yanks the paper away) Considering the success of your previous  adventure...
Cordelia,Don't let me interrupt. Wait. Let me interrupt. I'm in a  hurry. (raises her eyebrows)
Giles,What did you need?
Cordelia,"Uh, psych class. Freud and Jung. Book me?"
Giles,Happily.
Cordelia,"(notices Wesley, smiles) Check out Giles: The Next  Generation. What's your deal?"
Wesley,"(stammering nervously) Uh, I, uh... Well... (swallows) I'm a..."
Faith,New Watcher.
Cordelia,Oh.
Wesley,"(turns to Buffy, irritated) Does everybody know about you?"
Buffy,She's a friend.
Cordelia,Let's not exaggerate. So... (steps closer) You're the new  Watcher.
Wesley,"(summons his poise, holds out his hand) Wesley Wyndam-Pryce."
Cordelia,(takes it) I like a man with two last names. I'm Cordelia.
Wesley,(smiles) And you teach psychology.
Cordelia,I *take* psychology.
Giles,She's a student.
Wesley,"Oh, well. I, uh... (swallows) Yes. (squares his shoulders) In  fact, I am... here to watch... girls. Uh, uh, Buffy and Faith, to be  specific."
Cordelia,"(steps closer, smiling brightly) Well, it's about time we got  some fresh blood around here."
Wesley,(laughs nervously) Well. Fresh. Yes.
Giles,Here we go.
Cordelia,"(to Giles) Thanks. (to Wesley) So, welcome to Sunnydale."
Wesley,"(watching her back admiringly) My. She is cheeky, isn't she?"
Faith,"(still amused) Uh, first word: jail; second word: bait."
Wesley,"Ahem. (pulls out his handkerchief) Well, uh... (dabs his mouth)  Where were we?"
Buffy,"(slips off the table) Done. I mean, we were done, right?"
Faith,"(stands up) Uh, yep. Off to patrol. So we'll see ya."
Wesley,"(draws himself up) One moment, girls. I'm your commander now,  and on the matter of this murder, I am resolved. Natural or super, I  want to know."
Faith,Fine by me. Always ready to kick a little bad guy butt.
Faith,"(challengingly) So, you gonna rat me out? Is that it?"
Buffy,"(imploringly) Faith, we have to tell. I can't pretend to  investigate this. I can't pretend that I don't know."
Faith,"(snidely) Oh, I see. But you can pretend that Angel's still dead  when you need to protect him."
Buffy,"I *am* trying to protect you. Look, if-if we don't do the right  thing, it's only gonna make things worse for you."
Faith,Worse than jail for the rest of my young life? No way!
Buffy,"Faith, what we did was..."
Faith,"(ominously) Yeah. We. You were right there beside me when this  whole thing went down. Anything I have to answer for, you do, too.  You're a part of this, B. All the way."
Buffy,Hey.
Willow,Hey. (Buffy sits) Where's Faith? I-I saw her around. Figured  you two were gonna go kill some more nasty stuff.
Buffy,"Not right now. I-I, um, I think she bailed."
Buffy,"Willow, I was won..."
Willow,"Actually, I'm..."
Buffy,Um... You go ahead.
Willow,(puts her book away) I'm late. I-I'm meeting Michael. The  warlock guy? We're still trying to de-rat Amy.
Buffy,(smiles thinly) Okay.
Willow,(evasively) So see ya. (gets up and goes)
Buffy,(to herself) See you.
Woman,"(worriedly) Oh, I'm not sure. 7:00, maybe 8:00."
Angel,Your hand.
Buffy,Oh. It's okay.
Trick,It's supposed to do something besides shred?
Trick,And today you're not getting the ya-yas.
Trick,Maybe this will change your mood.
Trick,"Bombshell. The Deputy Mayor had wooden splinters in his wound.  Struck right through the heart with a sharp, pointed object. Now, word  is, someone was fighting vampires not a block away from the scene. Any  smart money says it was a Slayer who did this job."
Trick,"If he did, I'm thinking he said the wrong thing."
Faith,"(darkly) I'm telling you, we did the world a favor. (goes to his  chair) This guy was about as interesting as watching paint dry."
Buffy,(uneasily) Faith...
Faith,"I'm joking. Jeez, lighten up a little, B."
Faith,He came out of nowhere.
Buffy,(sympathetically) I know.
Faith,"(annoyed) Whatever. (puts down the picture) I'm not lookin' to  hug and cry and learn and grow. I'm just saying it happened quick, you  know?"
Faith,"You know what? Let's just blow. Who cares what this guy was  about? It's kind of moot now, don't you think?"
Buffy,I don't think he was in that alley by chance. I think he was  looking for us. I'd like to know why.
Faith,"So, what, you think there's some big conspiracy?"
Buffy,You were saying?
Faith,So his papers are gone. That doesn't prove anything.
Buffy,Except that somebody didn't want us to prove anything.
Trick,Yeah. We'll be wanting to turn up the heat.
Faith,"So the Mayor of Sunnydale is a Black Hat. That's a shocker, huh?"
Buffy,"Actually, yeah. I didn't get the bad guy vibe off of him."
Faith,"(exasperated) When are you gonna learn, B? It doesn't matter  what kind of vibe you get off a person. 'Cause nine times out of ten,  the face they're showing you is not the real one."
Buffy,(evenly) I guess you know a lot about that.
Faith,(stops and faces Buffy) What is that supposed to mean?
Buffy,"It's just, look at you, Faith. Less than twenty-four hours ago,  you killed a man. A-and now it's all zip-a-dee-doo-dah? It's not *your*  real face, and I know it. Look, I know what you're feeling because I'm  feeling it, too."
Faith,(insolently) Do you? So fill me in 'cause I'd like to hear this.
Buffy,"Dirty. Like something sick creeped inside you and you can't get  it out. And you keep hoping that it was just some nightmare, but it  wasn't. And we are gonna have to figure out..."
Faith,(interrupts) Is there gonna be an intermission in this?
Buffy,"Just let me talk to Giles, okay? I swear..."
Faith,"No! We're not bringing *anybody* else into this. You gotta keep  your head, B. This is all gonna blow over in a few days."
Buffy,And if it doesn't?
Faith,"If it doesn't, (shrugs) they got a freighter leaving the docks  at least twice a day. It ain't fancy, but it gets you gone."
Buffy,(in disbelief) And that's it? You just live with it? You see the  dead guy in your head every day for the rest of your life?
Faith,"(steps closer) Buffy, I'm not gonna *see* anything. I missed the  mark last night and I'm sorry about the guy. I really am! But it  happens! Anyway, how many people do you think we've saved by now,  thousands? And didn't you stop the world from ending? Because in my  book, that puts you and me in the plus column."
Buffy,We help people! It doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.
Faith,"Why not? The guy I offed was no Gandhi. I mean, we just saw he  was mixed up in dirty dealings."
Buffy,"Maybe, but what if he was coming to us for help?"
Faith,"What if he was? You're still not seeing the big picture, B.  Something made us different. We're warriors. We're built to kill."
Buffy,To kill demons! But it does *not* mean that we get to pass  judgment on people like we're better than everybody else!
Faith,We *are* better!
Faith,"(exhilarated) That's right, better. People need us to survive.  In the balance, nobody's gonna cry over some random bystander who got  caught in the crossfire."
Buffy,(sadly) I am.
Faith,"(disdainfully) Well, that's your loss."
Joyce,Buffy.
Buffy,"Late. Um, a-a little past 1:00, I guess."
Faith,(playing dumb) Just hanging.
Faith,No. I was with my friend Buffy.
Buffy,We were at Faith's watching TV.
Faith,Some old movie.
Buffy,Infomercial.
Faith,(innocently) Witnesses?
Det,Stein:  Any of this mean anything to you?
Faith,(flippantly) Yeah. That whoever did it wasn't hip to the Bronze  Age.
Buffy,Is that it? I'm kinda beat.
Faith,You mean am I covering for someone? Hardly. I'm not the throw- myself-on-the-sword type.
Buffy,(politely) I wish I could help you.
Buffy,Hey.
Willow,Hey.
Buffy,I need to talk to you.
Willow,"Good. (Buffy comes in, closes the door) 'Cause I've been  letting things fester. (goes to her bed) And I don't like it. (sits) I  wanna be fester-free."
Buffy,"(smiles weakly) Yeah. Me, too."
Willow,"(stands up) I mean, don't get me wrong. I-I completely  understand why you and Faith have been doing the bonding thing. You guys  work together. You... You should get along."
Buffy,It's more complicated than that.
Willow,"But, see, it's that exact thing that-that's just ticking me  off! It's this whole 'Slayers only' attitude. I mean, since when  wouldn't I understand? You, you talk to me about *everything*. I-it's  like all of a sudden I-I'm not cool enough for you because I can't kill  things with my bare hands."
Willow,"(regretfully) Oh! Oh, Buffy! Don't cry. (hugs her close) I'm  sorry. I-I was too hard on you. (lets go) Sometimes I unleash. I-I don't  know my own strength. I-i-it's bad. I-I-I'm bad. I'm a bad, bad, bad  person. (looks for forgiveness)"
Buffy,"(tearfully) Will, I'm in trouble."
Buffy,"And Faith acts like she doesn't even care. The way she talks,  it's like she didn't even make a mistake."
Willow,"(takes it all in) Do you think she's, like, i-in shock?"
Buffy,(sighs) I don't know. And I think that detective knows more than  he's saying. I think he knew that I was lying.
Willow,"(decisively) You have to go to Giles, Buffy. He'll know what to  do."
Buffy,(troubled) Giles?
Giles,Buffy.
Buffy,"Uh... (exhales) I don't really know how to say this, so I'm- I'm... I'm just gonna say it. I know I've kept things from you before,  but..."
Buffy,"(fumbling) But, um, but I-I've been blowing off my classes. You  know, in-in the sense of not attending. And, uh..."
Faith,"It's okay, Buffy. I told him."
Buffy,(surprised) You told him?
Faith,I had to. He had to know what you did.
Buffy,(confused) What I did?
Buffy,"Giles, no. Tha-That's just not what happened."
Giles,"(upset) I don't want to hear it, Buffy."
Buffy,(shocked) No! It...
Giles,I don't want to hear any more lies.
Buffy,(frantically to Faith) You can't be serious! You're setting me  up?
Giles,"Get in my office, now. Faith, I'll talk to you in the morning."
Buffy,"(imploringly) Giles, please, you have to..."
Giles,(sternly) Now!
Faith,Um... Sorry.
Buffy,"(desperately) Giles, I didn't do this. I swear. Look, I know  that I messed up badly, but the murder, i-it... it was..."
Giles,(interrupts) Faith. I know.
Giles,"She may have many talents, Buffy, but fortunately, lying is not  one of them."
Buffy,"Oh. Oh, God. (sits) I thought..."
Giles,I'm sorry. I needed her to think that I was on her side. I don't  know how far she'll take this charade.
Buffy,"Try far. Like, all the way."
Giles,You should have come to me right off. (sits facing her)
Buffy,"I know. Well, I, I wanted to."
Giles,But Faith wouldn't hear of it?
Buffy,"It's not all her fault, Giles. We both thought it was a vampire.  I-I only realized it a second before."
Giles,"Buffy, this is not the first time something like this has  happened."
Buffy,(confused) It's not?
Giles,"The Slayer is on the front line of a nightly war. Now, it's,  it's tragic, but accidents have happened."
Buffy,W-what do you do?
Giles,"Well, the Council investigates, um, metes out punishment if  punishment is due. But I... I have no plans to involve them. I mean,  it's the last thing Faith needs at the moment. She's unstable, Buffy. I  mean, she's utterly unable to accept responsibility."
Buffy,"She's freaking. So, so then we just have to help her deal,  right?"
Giles,She's in denial. There *is* no help for her until she admits  what happened.
Buffy,(uncertainly) I-I could talk to her.
Giles,(sighs) Perhaps.
Buffy,"Or maybe I'm too close. Maybe, maybe one of the guys could."
Giles,We should meet. It-it may be that they're seeing a different  side of her.
Buffy,Okay.
Giles,"In the meantime, no one else is to know. Understood?"
Buffy,Of course.
Giles,"I mean, this is... extremely delicate. If we scare her off now,  we may lose her forever."
Wesley,"Yes, hello. Mr. Travers, please. Quentin Travers. (listens)  Wesley Wyndam-Pryce calling. (listens, confused) The code word? Monkey.  (listens, exasperated) M-o-n-k... Just put him on, will you? This is an  emergency."
Willow,"Well, maybe we should all talk to Faith together."
Buffy,"You mean, like that intervention thing that you guys did on me?  As I recall, Xander and I nearly came to blows."
Xander,"Uh, *you* nearly came to blows, Buffy. I nearly came to loss of  limbs."
Giles,"No, Faith is too defensive for a confrontation like that. She'll  respond better to a one-on-one approach."
Xander,"Well, *I* can be the one... on her one. (gets confused looks)  Let's rephrase. I think she might listen to me. We kind of have, um, a  connection."
Buffy,A connection? Why would you think that...
Xander,(interrupts) I'm just saying it's worth a shot. That's all.
Giles,"No, I don't, I don't see it, Xander. I mean, of, of all of us,  you're the one person arguably that Faith has had the least contact  with."
Xander,"Yeah, but we hung out a little... recently, and she seemed to  be, um... responsive."
Buffy,When did you guys hang out?
Xander,"Oh, she was fighting one of those, uh, apocalypse demon things,  and I helped her. Gave her a ride home."
Buffy,And you guys talked?
Xander,(shakes his head) Not extensively. No.
Buffy,"Then why would you... (figures it out also, widens her eyes with  surprise) Oh."
Giles,"(gets it, surprised) Oh!"
Willow,I don't need to say 'oh'. I got it before. They slept together.
Giles,"Fine, fine, let's, let's, let's move on."
Buffy,"Alright. Look, I-I know that you mean well, Xander, but, um, I-I  just don't see Faith opening up to you. (gently) She doesn't take the  guys that she has a... 'connection' with very seriously. And they're,  they're kind of a big joke to her. No offense."
Xander,"(guffaws, sarcastically) Oh, no! I mean, why would I be  offended by *that*?"
Giles,"However, i-if you still want to be of assistance, I, I, I need  some help with research. There's still the business of the Mayor and Mr.  Trick to attend to."
Buffy,"Yeah, they, they seemed pretty cozy the other night."
Giles,"Yes. Uh, Willow, c-c-can you, um, access the Mayor's files?"
Willow,"(comes back to Earth) What? Oh, uh, sure. I can try."
Giles,"(stands up) Good, yes, because clearly we, uh, (picks up his  chair) we need to take a harder look at him. (turns it over) He's, he's,  um, he's obviously up to something. (sets it on a table)"
Buffy,What about Faith?
Giles,(sighs) I don't know. I need time.
Buffy,She needs help now. (Giles looks at her) I owe her that.
Lyrics,<I>Disappointment stops by from time to time</I>

Lyrics,<I>When I don't get what I want</I>
Lyrics,<I>The spoiled child inside breaks down</I>
Faith,(bored) What?
Xander,"(awkwardly) I just, uh, came by to see how you are, actually."
Faith,"(with hostility) I'm sick of people asking me that, for one  thing."
Xander,Can I come in? Just to talk. I promise.
Faith,(skeptical) Like you could make something happen if I didn't  want it to?
Xander,"Hey, yeah. Got me there. Pretty much not gonna try to... take  you under any circumstances. (holds out his arm) See, here, feel that.  (points to his biceps) Probably like a wet noodle to you, huh?"
Faith,(steps aside) Five minutes.
Xander,"That's all I need. (comes in) For talking and conversation.  (Faith closes the door) I'm, um, quick as a bunny."
Faith,(turns off the TV) Clock is running.
Xander,"It's just, uh... I heard about what happened, and I thought you  might need a friend."
Faith,"So then, go talk to Buffy. She's the one who killed a guy."
Xander,Yeah. I heard that version.
Faith,(not amused) Version?
Xander,"(sighs) Either way, i-it sounds like it was an accident, and  that's the important part."
Faith,"(angrily) No, the important part is that Buffy is the (makes  finger quotes) accidental murderer."
Xander,"Faith, you may not think so, but I sort of know you. And I've  seen you post-battle. And I know firsthand that you're, um... like a  wild thing. And half the time, you don't know what you're doing."
Faith,"(snidely) And you're living proof of that, aren't you?"
Xander,"See, you're trying to hurt me. But right now, you need someone  on your side. What happened wasn't your fault. And I'm willing to  testify to that in court if you need me."
Faith,"You'd dig that, wouldn't you? (gives him a sexy look) To get up  in front of all your geek pals and go on record about how I made you my  boy toy for a night."
Xander,"No. N-n-n-n-no, that's not it."
Faith,"*I* know what this is all about. (steps closer) You just came by  here (runs her fingertips all around his face) 'cause you want another  taste, don't you?"
Xander,"No! I mean, it was nice. It was great. It was kind of a blur.  But, okay, some day, sure, yay, but not now. Not like this."
Faith,(grabs hold of his head) More like how then? Lights on or off?  Kinks or vanilla?
Xander,"(jerks away) Faith, come on. I came here to help you. (looks  her in the eyes) I thought we had a connection."
Faith,(excitedly) You wanna feel a connection? It's just skin. (opens  his shirt) I see... I want... I take. (kisses him hard) I forget.
Xander,"(nervously) No. No, wait. It was more than that."
Faith,"I could do anything to you right now, and you want me to. I can  make you scream."
Faith,(breathlessly) I could make you die.
Faith,"Finally decided to tie me up, huh? I always knew you weren't  really a one-Slayer guy."
Angel,"(plays with a bat) I'm sorry about the chains. It's not that I  don't trust you... Actually, it *is* that I don't trust you. (sets the  bat aside)"
Faith,"The thing with Xander; I know what it looked like, but we were  just playing."
Angel,(evenly) And he forgot the safety word. (gets up) Is that it?  (walks over to her)
Faith,Safety words are for wusses.
Angel,"(crouches before her) I bet you're not big on trust games, now,  are you, Faith?"
Faith,You gonna shrink me now? Is that it?
Angel,"No, I just wanna talk to you."
Faith,"That's what they all say. And then it's just, 'Lemme stay the  night. Won't try anything.'"
Angel,"You wanna go the long way around, hey, I can do that. (stands  up) I'm not getting any older."
Buffy,How's she doing?
Angel,It's like talking to a wall. Only you get more from a wall.
Buffy,"But you'll keep trying, right?"
Angel,Sure. We're just getting started.
Buffy,"So, what do I do?"
Angel,"Look, right now, there's nothing that you can do."
Buffy,"Well, this could take awhile, right? (goes to the stairs) So,  I'll just go to Faith's and I'll get some of her stuff. That way she'll  see that we're on her side."
Angel,That's a good idea.
Buffy,Okay. (glances at Faith) I'll be back.
Angel,"Look, I... I don't want you to get your hopes up, Buffy. She may  not want us to help her."
Buffy,She does. She just doesn't know how to say it.
Angel,She killed a man. That changes everything for her.
Buffy,"(shakes her head) Giles said with counseling, they might not  even need to lock her up."
Angel,That's not what I mean. She's taken a life.
Buffy,I know.
Angel,She's got a taste for it now.
Trick,There was supposed to be a guard.
Trick,"Well, they're not gonna be much of a threat in jail."
Angel,I know what's goin' on with you.
Faith,Join the club. Everybody seems to have a theory.
Angel,"Hmm. (faces her) But I know what it's like to take a life. To  feel a future, a world of possibilities, snuffed out by your own hand. I  know the power in it. The exhilaration. It was like a drug for me."
Faith,"(looks up at him, sarcastically) Yeah? Sounds like you need some  help. A professional maybe."
Angel,Hmm. (goes to the coffee table) A professional couldn't have  helped me. (sits on it) It stopped when I got my soul back. My human  heart.
Faith,"Goody for you. If we're gonna party, let's get on with it.  (holds out her wrists) Otherwise, could you let me out of these things?"
Angel,"Faith, you have a choice. You've tasted something few ever do.  (stands up, paces) I mean, to kill without remorse is to feel like a  god."
Faith,"(struggles angrily) Right now, all I feel is a cramp in my  wrist, (yanks at the chains impatiently) so let me go!"
Angel,(crouches) But you're not a god. You're not much more than a  child. Going down this path will ruin you. You can't imagine the price  for true evil.
Faith,Yeah? (sneering) I hope evil takes MasterCard.
Angel,"(smiles) You and me, Faith, (straightens up) we're a lot alike.  Time was, I thought humans existed just to hurt each other. (sits next  to her) But then I came here. And I found out that there are other types  of people. People who genuinely wanted to do right. (looks at her) And  they make mistakes. And they fall down. You know, but they keep caring.  Keep trying. If you can trust us, Faith, this can all change. You don't  have to disappear into the darkness."
Faith,(confused) What?
Wesley,"By the order of the Watcher's Council of Britain... (lifts her  up) I am exercising my authority and removing you to England, (guides  her out) where you will accept the judgment of the disciplinary  committee."
Wesley,"I'm sorry for the extreme measures. Unfortunately, this is a  rather extreme circumstance."
Faith,Whatever.
Wesley,Please believe nobody is rushing to judgment. The first  priority of both myself and the Council is to help you.
Wesley,"Ah, now, none of that. (to his crony) Tighten her restraints.  Faith, there's no point in fighting this."
Faith,Have to disagree with you on that one. Now unlock these or I'll  pop this guy's head like a grape.
Faith,Don't even think about it.
Wesley,"Faith, you can't keep running."
Faith,"Wrong again, Wes."
Angel,It was the new Watcher. He had a couple of guys helping him.
Willow,Then he figured it out?
Giles,Which means that Faith will be soon on her way back to England  to face the Watcher's Council.
Buffy,And then what?
Giles,Most likely they'll lock her away for a good long while.
Buffy,So we head them off at the airport and stop them.
Willow,"Can I... I-I'm just wondering. Why? (gets a look from Buffy)  I'm not the most objective, I know. I kind of have an issue with Faith  sharing my people. (looks at Xander, who closes his eyes) But she  murdered someone and accused Buffy. Then she hurt Xander. I hate to say  it, but maybe she belongs behind bars."
Buffy,"She's out of control, I know. But Angel was getting somewhere  with her. She was opening up. If we could just stop Wesley."
Wesley,That's no longer an issue.
Giles,You let her get away?
Wesley,"'Let' wouldn't be the way I'd phrase it, but... Yes, she  escaped."
Angel,"That's good work. (walks across the room) First, you terrorize  her, then you put her back in the streets. (sits on the table)"
Wesley,That was hardly my plan. I was trying to save her.
Buffy,(accusingly) But you didn't! You probably destroyed her.
Giles,"(interrupts quietly) Buffy, that's enough. (puts his glasses  back on)"
Buffy,"I better find her before she does any more damage. (stands up)  We're gonna need to split up. I'll check the docks. That's probably  where she is. Giles, why don't you go to her motel? Xander, Willow, her  haunts and be careful."
Angel,I'll try the airport. (goes)
Wesley,What can I do? I want to help.
Buffy,(resentfully) You still got your ticket back to the mother  country?
Faith,"You don't give up, do you?"
Buffy,"Not on my friends, no."
Faith,"Yeah, because you and me are such solid buds, right? (walks down  the gangplank)"
Buffy,We could be. It's not too late.
Faith,"(disgusted) For me to change and be more like you, you mean?  Little Miss Goody-Two-Shoes? (stops halfway, leans on the railing) It  ain't gonna happen, B."
Buffy,"Faith, nobody is asking you to be like me, but you can't go on  like this."
Faith,"(grins evilly) Scares you, doesn't it?"
Buffy,"Yeah, it scares me. Faith, you're hurting people. You're hurting  yourself."
Faith,(approaches Buffy) But that's not it. That's not what bothers  you so much. What bugs you is you know I'm right. You know in your gut  we don't need the law. We *are* the law.
Buffy,No.
Faith,"Yes. You know exactly what I'm about 'cause you have it in you,  too."
Buffy,"No, Faith, you're sick."
Faith,"I've seen it, B. You've got the lust. And I'm not just talking  about screwing vampires."
Buffy,Don't you *dare* bring him into this.
Faith,"(taunting her) It was good, wasn't it? The sex? The danger? Bet  a part of you even dug him when he went psycho."
Buffy,No! (continues walking)
Faith,"(follows) See, you need me to toe the line because you're afraid  you'll go over it, aren't you, B? You can't handle watching me living my  own way, having a blast, because it tempts you! You know it could be  you!"
Faith,There's my girl.
Buffy,(tries to get away) No. I'm not gonna do this.
Faith,(doesn't let her go) Why not? It feels good. Blood rising.
Buffy,"(whispers) Oh, God..."
Trick,"I hear once you've tasted a Slayer, you never wanna go back."
Trick,"Oh, no. (shakes his head) No, this is no good at all."
Giles,So she saved you. (walks slowly around the table)
Buffy,"She could have left me there to die, Giles, but she didn't."
Giles,She opted to come back to town with you. That... That bodes  well. (sits) She still has a lot to face before she can put this behind  her.
Buffy,I'm not gonna give up on her.
Giles,(pours himself a cup) Then I think she stands a chance.
Faith,(accusingly) You sent your boy to kill me.
Faith,He's dust.
Faith,(steps brazenly into the doorway) I guess that means you have a  job opening.
