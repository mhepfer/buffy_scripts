Angelus,"There's moments in your life that make you, that set the  course of who you're gonna be. Sometimes they're little, subtle moments.  Sometimes... they're not. I'll show you what I mean."
Angel,(with an Irish accent) We'll be back when we've found a bit more  cash money! Keep the girls warm!
Angel,"Come on. We'll sneak in and take some of me father's silver.  He'll never miss it. He eats with his hands, the pig."
Angel,Ah. Why don't you rest right here.
Angel,"So, I'd ask myself... What's a lady of your station doing alone  in an alley with the reputation that this one has?"
Darla,(still facing away) Maybe she's lonely.
Angel,"In that case, I'd offer myself as escort to protect you from  harm and to while away the dull hours."
Darla,You're very gracious.
Angel,Hm. It's often been said.
Darla,(turns to face him) Are you certain you're up to the challenge?
Angel,"(approaches her) Milady, you'll find that with the exception of  an honest day's work, there's no challenge I'm not prepared to face."
Angel,Oh... But you're a pretty thing. Where are you from?
Darla,(smiles) Around. Everywhere.
Angel,"I never been anywhere myself. Always wanted to see the world,  but..."
Darla,I could show you. (smiles)
Angel,"Could you, then?"
Darla,"Things you've never seen, never even heard of."
Angel,Sounds exciting.
Darla,It is. And frightening.
Angel,I'm not afraid. Show me. Show me your world.
Darla,(closes her eyes) Close your eyes.
Buffy,Nice try.
Buffy,I want you to get a message to Angel for me. Tell him I'm done  waiting. I'm taking the fight to him.
Buffy,You got that? Need me to write it down for you?
Buffy,"Alright, I'll tell him myself."
Xander,(moans) I'm good. Don't worry about me. (rubs his neck)
Buffy,"You know, you don't have to patrol with me."
Xander,"(indicates the pile of ash) I had that guy under control until  he resorted to fisticuffs. (cranes his neck) Oh! What is that, um...  five vampires in three nights?"
Buffy,Yep. But no Angel.
Xander,"Are you, uh, really that anxious to come up against him?"
Buffy,I want it over with.
Xander,(nods) I hear that.
Buffy,"Oh, we better go. (exhales) I haven't even started studying for  finals yet. (starts to go)"
Xander,"(joins her) Oh, yeah, finals! Why didn't you let me die?"
Buffy,"Ah, look on the bright side. It'll all be over soon."
Angelus,"Yes, my love. It will."
Doug,"Careful, now. (points) Concentrate in this area. (watches her  work a moment) There you go."
Giles,Hello?
Doug,(comes to greet him) Rupert Giles?
Giles,Yes.
Doug,Doug Perren. (shakes his hand) Thanks for coming.
Giles,"Oh, not at all. It's... flattered to be asked."
Doug,"I spoke with Lou Tabor at the Washington Institute, and he told  me we had the best authority on obscure relics right here in Sunnydale."
Giles,"Oh... (laughs) He may have, uh, exaggerated a little. (sees the  obelisk) Ah, is this the..."
Doug,This is our baby. (they approach it) Construction workers dug it  up outside of town. Don't have a clue what it is. Any ideas?
Giles,"(touches and looks at the rock) A few. None I'd care to share  until I can verify. (notices the runes on it) You have, uh, carbon dated  it? (inspects the writings)"
Doug,The results'll be back in a couple of days. I'll go out on a limb  and say old.
Giles,"(smirks) Um, yes, it, it certainly... (picks up a jar and a  scraper) predates any, uh... settlements we've read about. (points) Um,  may, may I?"
Doug,Yeah. Sure.
Giles,"I assume you've, uh, you haven't tried to open it."
Doug,Open it?
Doug,"Ah, I'll be damned. I figured it was solid. What do you think is  in there?"
Giles,(staring intently) I don't know.
Doug,Well... I guess we won't know until we open it up.
Giles,"(considers) Yes, but could I ask, um... would you wait? I, uh...  I'd like to work on translating the text. It-it-it might give us an  indication of... what we'll find inside."
Doug,You don't want to be surprised?
Giles,"A-as a rule, no."
Doug,"Alright. You're the expert. But I'm pretty damn curious, though."
Giles,"(removes his glasses) Yes. Yes, so am I."
Xander,"Tell Angel I'm gonna kill him! No, wait. I'm gonna kill you!"
Xander,Die! Die! Die!
Xander,Aah! (makes a thudding noise) (squeals) Mother! (smiles)
Cordelia,Is that it?
Xander,Yeah. That's it. (chuckles) Scene! (grins)
Buffy,That's exactly how it happened.
Oz,"Well, I thought it was riveting. Uh, I was a little unclear about  some of the themes."
Buffy,The theme is Angel's too much of a coward to take me on face-to- face.
Xander,"(still playing with the fish sticks) And the other theme was  'Buy American', but it, uh, got kind of buried."
Willow,(to Buffy) Do you think you're ready to fight Angel?
Buffy,"I wish people would stop asking me that. Yes, I'm ready. I'm  also willing and able. Just the one test I might actually pass."
Willow,Don't say that! You're gonna pass everything. I will get you  through this semester if I have to sweat blood.
Xander,Do you think you're likely to? 'Cause I'd like to be elsewhere.
Willow,It was only metaphor blood.
Oz,I think you'd sweat cute blood.
Willow,"(gives Oz a smile) (to Buffy) Sixth period, after my computer  class, we'll rock on chemistry."
Buffy,Ready to rock.
Cordelia,"Boy, Willow, you've really got the teaching bug: taking over  computer class, tutoring..."
Willow,(smiles widely) I love it. I really do.
Cordelia,"I think it's great to do that before you go out and fail in  the real world. That way you're not falling back on something. You're  falling... well, forward."
Xander,(rolls his eyes) And almost sixty-five percent of that was  actual compliment. Is that a personal best?
Cordelia,"Gee, Xander, what are you gonna teach when you fail in life?  Advanced loser-being?"
Xander,I will teach... (with a French accent) zee Language of Love!  (reaches for her)
Cordelia,(fights him off) Don't touch me! You have fish hands!
Xander,"Come, let me caress you!"
Cordelia,Stop it!
Xander,Let me in!
Cordelia,No! (laughs) Don't!
Snyder,That's enough of that. (to Willow) And you! Are we having a  chair shortage?
Willow,I didn't read anything about... Oh. (slides off of Oz's lap and  into her chair) I get it.
Snyder,"These public displays of affection are not acceptable in my  school. This isn't an orgy, people. It's a classroom."
Buffy,Yeah! Where they teach lunch.
Snyder,"(glares at her) Just give me a reason to kick you out, Summers.  Just give me a reason. (walks off)"
Cordelia,"How about because you're a tiny, impotent Nazi with a bug up  his butt the size of an emu?"
Buffy,Sums it up.
Cordelia,Don't you think?
Willow,"(smiles) (to Buffy) Do you wanna come by my house tonight and  study, too?"
Buffy,Maybe. I-I do have to patrol.
Willow,Again? Do you really expect Angel to turn up tonight?
Buffy,"No, I don't expect him to. But that's usually when he does."
Drusilla,"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."
Drusilla,It's been two days since my last confession. (waits for an  answer) Father?
Angelus,(goes along with it) That's not very long.
Drusilla,"(with a trembling voice) Oh, Father, I'm so afraid."
Angelus,The Lord is very forgiving. Tell me your sins.
Drusilla,"I had... (breathes deeply) I've been seeing again, Father.  Yesterday, the men were going to work in the mine. I had... (shakes) a  terrible fright. (draws a frightened breath) My stomach all (draws  another) tied up, and I saw this horrible... crash. (calms a bit) My  mummy said to keep my peace, it didn't mean nothing. But this morning...  they had a cave-in. Two men died."
Angelus,Go on.
Drusilla,"Me mum says... I'm cursed. (exhales) My seeing things is an  affront to the Lord, (inhales sharply) that only he's supposed to see  anything before it happens. (inhales, sobs) But I don't mean to, Father,  I swear! (inhales) I swear! (begins to cry) I try to be pure in his  sight. (sobs) I don't want to be an evil thing."
Angelus,"Oh, hush, child. The Lord has a plan for all creatures. Even a  Devil child like you."
Drusilla,(taken aback) A Devil?
Angelus,Yes! You're a spawn of Satan. All the Hail Marys in the world  aren't going to help. The Lord will use you and smite you down. He's  like that.
Drusilla,(frightened) What can I do?
Angelus,"Fulfill his plan, child. Be evil. Just give in."
Drusilla,No! (sobs) I want to be good. (sobs) I want to be pure.
Angelus,"We all do, at first. The world doesn't work that way."
Drusilla,"Father... I beg you... Please... Please, help me."
Angelus,Very well. Ten Our Fathers and an Act of Contrition. Does that  sound good?
Drusilla,"(relieved) Yes. (exhales) Yes, Father. Thank you."
Angelus,The pleasure was mine. And my child... (raises his hand to the  lattice between them)
Drusilla,Yes?
Angelus,(stares at her) God is watching you.
Spike,"Nice walk, pet?"
Drusilla,(holds her tummy as though sick) I met an old man. Didn't  like him. He got stuck in my teeth. (licks her fingers) (faces Spike)  But then the Moon started whispering to me... (closes her eyes and leans  her head back) All sorts of dreadful things.
Angelus,"Well, what did it say?"
Spike,Oh. Look who's awake.
Angelus,What did the Moon tell you? (walks around Dru) Did you have a  vision? Is something coming?
Drusilla,"Oh, yeah. (whispers) Something terrible. Psst, psst, psst,  psst, psst, psst..."
Angelus,Where?
Drusilla,At the museum. A tomb... (smiles) with a surprise inside.
Angelus,(holds his hand up to her head) You can see all that in your  head?
Spike,"No, you ninny. She read it in the morning paper. (hands over the  paper)"
Angelus,"(takes the paper and looks) Oh, my."
Drusilla,That's what's been whispering to me. Sh.
Angelus,"Oh, yeah. (to Drusilla) Don't worry, though. Soon it'll stop.  (to Spike) Soon it'll scream."
Buffy,Waah! This doesn't make any sense. (pouts at Willow)
Willow,"Well, sure it does. See... (takes the paper and looks) Oh, no,  this doesn't make any sense."
Buffy,(shrugs) It's senseless. (plays with her pencil)
Willow,"(encouragingly) It is, but at least you know that, so you're  learning. (looks at the problem more closely)"
Buffy,"Yay me. Well, it doesn't matter anyway. I mean, when in the real  world am I ever gonna need chemistry or history or math or the English  language?"
Willow,(shoots Buffy a glance) Okay. I see your problem.
Buffy,I'm a moron?
Willow,"(gives Buffy a look) Will you stop that? You're not stupid!  You've just had a lot on your mind. You can learn this real easily, but  if you're just gonna give up, then don't waste my time."
Buffy,(impressed) Wow. You really *are* a good teacher. (smiles)
Willow,"Okay. Look at this. A covalent bond, which means these two  atoms are linked by this..."
Buffy,Ohh! (moans) Hold that thought.
Buffy,(sits back up) Okay. I'm Learn Girl.
Willow,"Okay. (points to the paper) So, see here..."
Buffy,(has an epiphany) Deja vu.
Willow,Really?
Buffy,Yeah. I have this perfect memory of the pencil and...
Buffy,"Oh, hey. (pulls up the disk and pencil) You dropped this."
Willow,It's not mine. It might be something of Ms. Calendar's.
Buffy,This feels kinda morbid.
Willow,(smiles at Buffy) I've gone through most of her files already.
Buffy,Does that make it *less* morbid or you *really* morbid?
Willow,"(sighs) I had to, to teach her class."
Buffy,"Relax, Will. I was making with the funny."
Buffy,(looks closely) Does that say 'restoration'? (keeps reading)
Willow,"It's one of her spells, I think. (looks at Buffy) Ms. Calendar  wasn't a practicing witch, but she did dabble..."
Buffy,(interrupts) Willow... (keeps reading)
Willow,"Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy."
Translation,"Neither dead, nor of the living, I invoke you, spirit of  the passing. Return to the body what distinguishes Man from the beast!"
Translation,So it shall be.
Translation,Restore this one.
Angel,(confused) Where am I? (pants hard)
Angel,"(still not understanding) Killed? I, I don't..."
Angel,No...
Angel,No... No... No...
Giles,What are you saying?
Buffy,The curse. (holds out a printout) This is it.
Willow,Looks like Ms. Calendar was trying to replicate the original  curse. To restore Angel's soul again.
Giles,"(takes the printout, stares at it) She said it couldn't be done."
Buffy,"Well, she tried anyway. And it looks like it might have worked."
Xander,"So he killed her... before she could tell anyone about it. What  a prince, huh? (looks away)"
Cordelia,"This is good, right? I mean, we can curse him again."
Giles,"Um, well, this, um... certainly points the way, but... the  ritual itself requires a greater knowledge of the black arts than I, I,  I can claim."
Willow,"Well, I've been going through her files and, and researching  the black arts, for fun, or educational fun, and I may be able to work  this."
Giles,"(very concerned) W-Willow... channeling... such potent magicks  through yourself, it could open a door that you may not be able to  close."
Buffy,"I don't want you putting yourself in any danger, Will."
Willow,"And I don't want danger. Big 'no' to danger, but I may be the  best person to do this."
Xander,"Hi! For those of you who have just tuned in, (gets up) everyone  here is a crazy person. (walks to the end of the table) So this spell  might restore Angel's humanity? Well, here's an interesting angle.  (harshly) Who cares?"
Buffy,I care.
Xander,(not surprised) Is that right.
Giles,"Let's not lose our perspective here, Xander."
Xander,(standing his ground) I'm Perspective Guy. Angel's a killer.
Willow,Xander...
Buffy,It's not that simple.
Xander,(disgusted) What? All is forgiven? I can't believe you people!
Cordelia,(gets up) Xander has a point.
Xander,"(to Cordelia, in a raised voice) You know, just for once, I  wish you'd support me, and I realize right now that you were, and I'm  embarrassed, so I'm gonna get back to the point, (to the others) which  is that Angel needs to die."
Giles,Curing Angel seems to have been Jenny's last wish.
Xander,"Yeah? Well, Jenny's dead."
Giles,(approaches Xander angrily) Don't you *ever* speak of her in  that tone again!
Xander,(yells back) Can't you hear what I'm saying?
Buffy,Stop it! Stop it!
Willow,(quietly) What do you wanna do?
Buffy,(sighs) (quietly) I-I don't know. What happened to Angel wasn't  his fault.
Xander,"Yeah, but what happened to Ms. Calendar is."
Xander,(very coldly) You can paint this any way you want. But the way  I see it is that you wanna forget all about Ms. Calendar's murder so you  can get your boyfriend back.
Doug,Hello?
Angelus,I'll have one of these to go.
Angelus,Dru...
Angelus,Save me some.
Buffy,"Well, I'll do a couple of sweeps, and then I'll stop by.  (listens) Yeah, Xander was pretty much being a... Willow! Where did you  learn that word? My God. You kiss your mother with that mouth?"
Buffy,I don't know. I don't know what I wanna do.
Buffy,"I'll, I'll see you in a little while, okay?"
Buffy,"(exhales) You know, polite people call before they jump out of  the bushes and attack you."
Kendra,(in her accent) Just wanted to test your reflexes.
Buffy,How about testing my face-punching? 'Cause I think you'll find  it's improved.
Kendra,I was on my way to your house. Saw you walking. Couldn't help  meself.
Buffy,"(smiles) Which begs the question, and don't think I'm not glad  to see you, but, why are you here? (Kendra starts to answer) Oh, wait.  No, let me guess. Your watcher informed you (imitating her accent) dat a  very dark power is about to rise in Sunnydale."
Kendra,Dat's about it.
Buffy,"Great. So, you have any idea what this dark power is?"
Spike,(hears them coming) It's a big rock. I can't wait to tell my  friends. They don't have a rock this big.
Angelus,"Spike, boy, you never did learn your history."
Spike,"Let's have a lesson, then."
Angelus,"Acathla the demon came forth to swallow the world. (strolls to  the obelisk) He was killed by a virtuous knight who pierced the demon's  heart before he could draw a breath to perform the act. Acathla turned  to stone, as demons sometimes do, and was buried (turns to face Spike)  where neither man nor demon would want to look. (starts away from the  obelisk) Unless of course they're putting up low-rent housing. Boys..."
Drusilla,He fills my head. I can't hear anything else.
Spike,Let me guess. Someone pulls out the sword...
Angelus,Someone worthy...
Spike,"Mm. The demon wakes up, and wackiness ensues."
Drusilla,"(opens her eyes, lowers her arms) He will swallow the world."
Angelus,And every creature living on this planet will go to Hell.
Angelus,My friends... we're about to make history... end. (smiles  evilly)
Giles,"I've been on the phone to the museum. The artifact in question  is missing, and the curator has been murdered. Vampires. (leans on the  table)"
Buffy,And you're sure this was the tomb of Alfalfa?
Giles,"Acathla. And yes, the information provided by Kendra's Watcher  seems conclusive."
Willow,"Okay, somebody explain the whole 'he will suck the world into  Hell' thing, because that's the part I'm not loving."
Giles,"Well, the, uh, (puts on his glasses) the Demon Universe exists  in a dimension separate from our own. (sits on the table) With one  breath, Acathla will create a vortex, a-a kind of, um... whirlpool that  will pull everything on Earth into that dimension, where any non-demon  life will suffer horrible and... eternal torment."
Buffy,"So that would be the literal kind of 'sucked into Hell'. (smiles  nervously) Neat. (frowns, turns to Willow) Willow, I think you should  try the curse."
Kendra,I tend to side with your friend Xander on this one. Angel  should be eliminated.
Buffy,"Oh, I'll fight him. I'll kill him if I have to. But if I don't  get there in time, or if I lose, then Willow might be our only hope."
Willow,"(taken aback) I don't *wanna* be our only hope! Uh, I crumble  under pressure! Let's have another hope."
Kendra,"We have. (pulls a sword from her bag) Blessed by the knight who  first slew the demon. (Giles looks at the sword, intrigued) If all else  fails, this might stop it. I tink."
Giles,"(approaches) Ooh. May I? May I? (takes the sword from Kendra)  Thank you. Well, l-let's, uh, hope all else doesn't fail. (to Willow)  Um, how close are you to f-figuring out the ritual of the curse?"
Willow,"(goes to her pack) I need about a day, and... (picks up some  papers and reads) an 'Orb of Thesulah'? Whatever that is."
Giles,(hands the sword back to Kendra) Spirit vault for rituals of the  undead. (heads toward his office) I've got one. (embarrassed) I-I've  been using it as a... paperweight. (disappears into his office)
Willow,(to Buffy) This means I can't help you study for tomorrow's  final.
Buffy,"Ah, I'll wing it. Of course, if we go to Hell by then, I won't  have to take 'em. (worried) Or maybe I'll be taking them forever."
Giles,"(comes back with the Orb) Angel has a ritual of his own to  perform before he can remove the sword and awaken Acathla. With any  luck, it should take some time."
Drusilla,Spike?
Drusilla,"Spike, my sweet! The fun's about to begin."
Angelus,"(comes toward the young man) I will drink... the blood will  wash in me, over me, and I will be cleansed. I will be worthy to free  Acathla. (looks at Spike) Bear witness... (looks at Drusilla) as I  ascend... (looks ahead and morphs into his game face) as I become."
Angelus,"Everything that I am, everything that I have done, has led me  here."
Whistler,"God, are you disgusting."
Whistler,"This is really an unforgettable smell. This is the stench of  death you're giving off here. And the look says, uh... Crazy Homeless  Guy. It's not good."
Angel,(angrily) Get away from me.
Whistler,"What are you gonna do, bite me? (gasps and jumps back)  Horrors! A vampire!"
Whistler,"Ah, but you wouldn't bite me on account of your poor,  tortured soul. It's so sad, a vampire with a soul. It's so poignant."
Angel,(confused) Who are you?
Whistler,Let's take a walk.
Whistler,"What are you eating? (they continue across) Like, a rat once  a month?"
Whistler,"Hey! (car honks, they continue) Look, you're skin and bones  here! Butcher shops are throwing away more blood in a day than you could  stand. Good blood. (they reach the far side) You lived in the world a  little bit, you'd know that."
Angel,I wanna know who you are. (stops)
Whistler,(stops and faces him) And I wanna know who *you* are.
Angel,You already do.
Whistler,Not yet. But I'm looking to find out. 'Cause you could go  either way here.
Angel,I don't understand you.
Whistler,Nobody understands me. That's my curse. (chuckles)
Whistler,Dog me. Mustard.
Whistler,(to Angel) My name's Whistler.
Vendor,Here you go.
Whistler,"(takes the dog) Thanks. (hands over a bill, turns to Angel)  Anyway, lately it is. (takes a bite) Mm."
Angel,(looks down) You're not a vampire.
Whistler,"A demon... technically. I mean, I'm not a bad guy. Not all  demons are dedicated to the destruction of all life."
Angel,"(looks at him) Whadaya mean, I can go either way?"
Whistler,"I mean that you can become an even more useless rodent than  you already are, or you can become someone. A person. Someone to be  counted."
Angel,I just wanna be left alone. (starts away)
Whistler,"Well, yeah, you've been left alone for, what, ninety years  already. (Angel turns back) And what a package you are. The Stink Guy!"
Angel,What do you want from me?
Whistler,I want you to see something.
Whistler,"We'd have to leave now. You see, and then you tell me what  you wanna do."
Angel,Where is it?
Buffy,"So I'm like, 'Dad, do you want me to go to the dance in an  outfit I've already worn? Why do you hate me?'"
Buffy,"Where were you when I got over Tyler? He's of the past. (Angel  watches her) Tyler would have to crawl on his hands and knees to get me  to go to the dance with him. Which, actually, he's supposed to do after  practice, so I'm gonna wait."
Buffy,(waves to Girl#1) Call me!
Buffy,(waves to Girl#2) Call me! (waves to Girl#3) Call me!
Watcher,Buffy Summers?
Buffy,(looks at him) Yeah? (smiles) Hi! (confused) What?
Watcher,I need to speak with you.
Buffy,"(worried) You're not from Bullock's, are you? 'Cause I-I meant  to pay for that lipstick."
Watcher,There isn't much time. You must come with me. Your destiny  awaits.
Buffy,"(confused, shakes her head) I don't have a destiny. (nods) I'm  destiny-free, really."
Watcher,"(seriously) Yes, you have. You are the Chosen One. You alone  can stop them."
Buffy,Who?
Watcher,The vampires.
Buffy,(considers for a moment) Huh?
Buffy,Oof!
Buffy,"Oh, God..."
Buffy,"Oh, God... Oh... Oh, God... Unh!"
Buffy,Oh! Not the heart!
Watcher,You see? You see your power?
Joyce,Why didn't you call?
Buffy,(faces her mom) I'm sorry. I-I didn't know it was so late. Tyler  and I were talking.
Joyce,(exhales) That boy is irresponsible.
Buffy,"No, mom. It's not his fault. (takes off her jacket)"
Joyce,"You know we worry, that's all."
Joyce,Dinner's in ten minutes. (leaves)
Buffy,(whispers) Yeah.
Hank,Did she say where she was?
Joyce,She was with Tyler.
Hank,"I don't want her seeing him anymore, period!"
Joyce,"You're overreacting, dear."
Hank,Don't do that! Don't talk to me like I'm a kid!
Joyce,I don't! Just forget it!
Hank,"Just because you can't discipline her, I have to be the ogre!"
Joyce,I am not having this conversation again! Alright?
Whistler,"She's gonna have it tough, that Slayer. She's just a kid. The  world's full of big, bad things."
Angel,I wanna help her. (Whistler looks at him) I want... I wanna  become someone.
Whistler,"God, jeez, look at you. She must be prettier than the last  Slayer. (Angel looks away) This isn't gonna be easy. The more you live  in this world, the more you see how apart from it you really are.  (sternly) And this is dangerous work. Right now, you couldn't go three  rounds with a fruit fly!"
Angel,(with resolve) I wanna learn from you.
Whistler,Alright.
Angel,But I don't wanna dress like you. (starts to leave)
Whistler,"(follows) Again, you're annoying me. You're lucky we need you  on our side."
Angelus,"I have strayed, I have been lost. But Acathla redeems me. With  this act, we will be free."
Spike,(sing-song) Someone wasn't worthy.
Angelus,(scrambles to his feet) Damn it!
Drusilla,(freaks out) This is so... disappointing! (moans)
Angelus,"(paces angrily) There must be something I missed. The  incantations, the blood... I don't know!"
Drusilla,(whining) What are we going to do?
Angelus,(menacingly) What we always do in a time of trouble: turn to  an old friend.
Angelus,(viciously) We'll have our Armageddon. I swear!
Vampire,Tonight... Sundown... (everyone looks up) At the graveyard...
Teacher,(gets up) Excuse me...
Vampire,You will come to him. (takes the shawl off) You will come to  him or more will die.
Vampire,Tonight!
Vampire,His hour is at hand!
Buffy,She said more would die. I have to go.
Kendra,Den I should go wit you.
Buffy,"(faces Kendra) No. I need you here just in case. (heads for the  stairs) I can take care of myself. And look, (comes down) as long as  Angel's fighting me, then he can't do this end-of-the-world ritual  thingy, and that's a good. (reaches the table) Will, what do you think?"
Willow,(looks over her research) I just want to cross-check...
Buffy,"We don't have time. If this is gonna work, it has to work now."
Willow,Okay. Then I need maybe half an hour once we're all set up.
Giles,"(looks at the shelves) Which means you just have to hold Angel  off. Don't let him close on you. (pulls out a book) If the curse  succeeds, you'll, you'll know."
Cordelia,"Why don't you just wait here to find out if it worked, see if  he phones you?"
Buffy,I can't risk him killing any more people. I better go. (starts  out)
Xander,Be careful.
Buffy,(looks back) I will. (starts out again.)
Kendra,Here...
Kendra,"In case de curse does not succeed, dis is my lucky stake. I  have killed many vampires wit it. I call it Mr. Pointy."
Buffy,You named your stake?
Kendra,(a bit embarrassed) Yes.
Buffy,(smiles) Remind me to get you a stuffed animal.
Buffy,Thanks.
Kendra,(exhales) Watch your back.
Angelus,"Hello, lover. I wasn't sure you'd come."
Buffy,"After your immolation-o-gram? Come on, I had to show. Shouldn't  you be out destroying the world right now, pulling the sword out of Al  Franken or whatever his name is?"
Angelus,There's time enough. I wanted to say goodbye first. You are  the one thing in this dimension I will miss.
Buffy,This is a beautiful moment we're having. Can we please fight?
Angelus,I didn't come here to fight.
Buffy,(raises her eyebrows) No?
Angelus,"Gosh, I was hoping we could get back together. What do you  think? Do we have a shot? (gets a look from Buffy) Alright. We'll fight."
Giles,"Quod perditum est, invenietur."
Translation,"What is lost, return."
Willow,'Not dead nor not of the living. Spirits of the interregnum I  call...'
Buffy,"Come on, Willow."
Willow,"'Let him know the pain of humanity, gods. Reach your wizened  hands to me. Give me the sword...'"
Giles,Get out! Go!
Xander,Go!
Angelus,"Jeez, is it me, or is your heart not in this?"
Angelus,"Maybe I'll just go home, destroy the world."
Buffy,"Well, I think Mr. Pointy'll have something to say about that.  Come on. Let's finish this. You and me."
Angelus,"(chuckles) Y-you never learn, do you? This wasn't about you.  This was never about you. (chuckles)"
Angelus,(smiles) And you fall for it every single time!
Drusilla,Enough.
Drusilla,"Look at me, Dearie."
Drusilla,Be... in my eyes. Be... in me.
Drusilla,Night-night.
Drusilla,"Let's get what we came for, dears."
Whistler,"Bottom line is, even if you see 'em coming, you're not ready  for the big moments."
Whistler,"No one asks for their life to change, not really. But it  does."
Whistler,"So what are we, helpless? Puppets? No. The big moments are  gonna come. You can't help that. It's what you do afterwards that  counts. That's when you find out who you are."
Officer,Freeze!
Whistler,You'll see what I mean.
