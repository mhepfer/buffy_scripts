Buffy,"(sarcastically) Oh, great! A book!"
Giles,"Oh, uh, I, uh... haven't gone through the new arrivals. Uh, put  it in, uh, (points with his book) in, in that pile."
Dave,"Here, I'll get it."
Buffy,"Oh, thanks, Dave. The Willow pile."
Giles,"Uh, when I've examined it, you can, uh, uh, skim it."
Giles,(gives her a sarcastic look) Of course.
Giles,"(smugly) Ms. Calendar, I'm sure your computer science class is  fascinating, but I happen to believe that one can survive in modern  society without being a slave to the, um, idiot box."
Giles,I still prefer a good book.
Fritz,"(self-righteously) The printed page is obsolete. (stands up)  Information isn't bound up anymore. It's an entity. The only reality is  virtual. If you're not jacked in, you're not alive. (grabs his books and  leaves)"
Giles,Oh...
Giles,That is a fact that I regard with genuine horror.
Willow,I've just got a few more. I'll hang for a bit.
Willow,"Xander, you wanna stay and help me?"
Xander,(in disbelief) Are you kidding?
Willow,"(taken aback) Yes, it was a joke I made up."
Xander,"Willow, I love you, but bye! (leaves)"
Willow,(calls after him) See you tomorrow!
Xander,"(ignores her) Buffy, wait up!"
Giles,"I'm, I'm just gonna stay and clean up a little. I'll, uh, I'll  be back in the middle ages. (starts up the stairs)"
Moloch,Where am I?
Buffy,"Willow! Willow, hey, wait up! (reaches her)"
Willow,"Oh, Buffy, I didn't even see you."
Buffy,"Or hear me. What was up last night? I tried your line, like, a  million times."
Willow,"Oh, I was, I was talking."
Buffy,"Talking to...? (no answer) Okay, that's it, you have a secret,  and that's not allowed."
Willow,Why not? (opens her locker)
Buffy,'Cause... there's a rule.
Willow,"Well, I sort of met someone. (smiles)"
Buffy,(excitedly) I knew it! This is so important! When did you meet?
Willow,Last week after we did the scanning project in the library.  (closes her locker)
Buffy,(curiously) Does he go here? What's his name? Have you kissed  him? What's he like?
Willow,"(amused) No, Malcolm, no, and very nice."
Buffy,(annoyed) You are a thing of evil for not telling me this right  away!
Willow,"Well, I wasn't sure there was anything to tell. But last night,  oh! We talked all night, it was amazing. He's so smart, Buffy, and, and  he's romantic, and we agree about everything!"
Buffy,(sighs) What's he look like?
Willow,I don't know!
Dave,"(to the monitor) Yes, I will. I promise."
Buffy,"So, you've been seeing a guy, and you don't know what he looks  like? Okay, this is a puzzle. No, wait, I'm good at these. Does it  involve a midget and a block of ice?"
Willow,I met him online.
Buffy,On line for what?
Buffy,Oh!
Buffy,"No, I have a free."
Buffy,Sure.
PC,You have mail.
Willow,It's him! (types to get the message)
Message,I'm thinking of you.
Willow,He's so sweet!
Buffy,(nods) He's a sweetie. (smiles nervously)
Willow,What should I write back?
Buffy,"(cautiously) Uh, Willow, I think it's really great that you have  this cool pen pal, but don't you think you're kinda rushing all into  this? Y'know what I mean?"
Willow,"(excitedly) 'I'm thinking of you, too!' (crestfallen) No,  that's incredibly stupid!"
Buffy,"Will, down girl! Let's focus here, okay? What do you actually  know about this guy?"
Willow,"(disappointed) Oh, see, I knew you'd react like this."
Buffy,Like what?
Buffy,"I just wanna make sure you're careful, that's all."
Willow,Buffy...
Buffy,He could be different than you think.
Moloch,Watch her.
Willow,"His name is Malcolm Black, he's eighteen, he lives in Elmwood,  which is about eighty miles from here, and he likes me!"
Buffy,"Short, tall, skinny, fat?"
Willow,Why does everything have to be about looks?
Buffy,"Not everything, but some stuff is. I mean, what if you guys get  really, really intense, and then you find out that he... has... a hairy  back?"
Willow,"Well, no! Uh, he doesn't talk like somebody who would have a  hairy back. And anyways, that stuff doesn't matter when you really care  about each other. Maybe I'm not his ideal either."
Buffy,"Hey, I'm just trying to make sure that he's good enough for you.  I think it's great that you met someone."
Fritz,New project.
Fritz,You'll die.
Boy,(upset) This isn't my report! 'Nazi Germany was a model of a well  ordered society'? I didn't write that! Who's been in my files?
Xander,"Hup, guess who?"
Willow,"Uh, Xander?"
Xander,"Yeah, but keep guessing anyway."
Willow,Xander.
Xander,"(takes his hand from her eyes) Oh, I can't fool ya, you see  right through my petty charade. We goin' to the Bronze tonight?"
Willow,"(smiles) Not me, I think I'm gonna call it an early night."
Xander,"Oh, Malcolm, right? (Willow smiles and nods) Yeah, I heard. But  you're gonna be missin' out. I'm plannin' to be witty. I'm gonna make  fun of all the people who won't talk to me."
Willow,That's nice. Have a good time!
Buffy,She certainly looks perky.
Xander,"Yeah, color in the cheeks, bounce in the step... I don't like  it. It's not healthy. (faces her) So, are you goin' to the Bronze  tonight? Oh, probably not, you probably have some vampire slaying or  some lame endeavor like that, don't you? Everyone deserts me."
Buffy,Check out the jealous man!
Xander,What are you talking about?
Buffy,You're jealous.
Xander,Of what?
Buffy,"Willow's got a thang, and Xander's left hanging."
Xander,"Oh, that's meaningless drivel. I'm not interested in Willow  like that."
Buffy,"Yeah, but you got used to being the Belle of the Ball."
Xander,"No, it's just... this Malcolm guy? What's his deal? I mean,  tell me you're not slightly wigged."
Buffy,"Okay, slightly. I mean, just not knowing what he's really like."
Xander,"Or who he really is. I mean, sure he says he's a high school  student, but I can say I'm a high school student."
Buffy,You are.
Xander,"Okay, but I can also say that I'm an elderly Dutch woman. Get  me? I mean, who's to say I'm not if I'm in the elderly Dutch chat room?"
Buffy,"(making light) I get your point! (gets his point) I get your  point. Oh, this guy could be anybody. He could be weird, or crazy, or  old, or... He could be a circus freak. (panicked) He's probably a circus  freak!"
Xander,"Yeah. I mean, we read about it all the time. Y'know, people  meet on the 'Net, they talk, they get together, have dinner, a show,  horrible ax murder."
Buffy,"Willow ax murdered by a circus freak... Okay, okay, what do we  do? (realizes her paranoia) What are we doing? Xander, you get me  started! We are totally overreacting!"
Xander,"But it's fun, isn't it?"
Fritz,(in a trance) I'm jacked in. I'm jacked in. I'm jacked in.
Fritz,I'm jacked in.
Buffy,Whoa! You're the Late Girl.
Willow,I overslept.
Buffy,Till fifth period? Talkin' to Malcolm last night?
Willow,Yeah. (sees Buffy's look) What?
Buffy,Nothing.
Willow,You're having an expression.
Buffy,"I'm not. But if I was, it'd be saying, 'This just isn't like  you.'"
Willow,Not like me to have a boyfriend?
Buffy,He's boyfriendly?
Willow,"(confused) I don't understand why you don't want me to have  this. I mean, boys don't chase me around all the time. I thought you'd  be happy for me."
Buffy,"(concerned) I just want you to be sure. To meet him face to  face. In daylight, in a crowded place with some friends. Y'know, before  you become all... obsessive."
Willow,Malcolm and I really care about each other. Big deal if I blow  off a couple classes.
Buffy,I thought you said you overslept.
Willow,Malcolm said you wouldn't understand.
Buffy,Malcolm was right.
Buffy,"Dave? (he's oblivious) Hey there, Dave. Anybody home?"
Dave,"Oh, what do you want?"
Buffy,I wanted to ask you something if you have a minute.
Dave,What is it?
Buffy,"Well, you're a computer geek... genius, and, uh, I sort of have  a technical problem. If I wanted to find out something about someone, i- if someone e-mailed me, could I trace the letter?"
Dave,"Well, you could pull up somebody's profile based on their user  name."
Buffy,"But they write the profile themselves, right? And so they could  say anything they wanted."
Dave,True.
Buffy,"Wow! I had knowledge! (Dave smiles) Well, is there a way to find  out exactly where a letter, an e-letter came from? I mean, the actual  location of the computer?"
Dave,(considers) That's a challenge.
Buffy,"'Cause, you see, Willow's got this boyfriend, Malcolm, and to  tell you the truth, I think..."
Dave,"(interrupts, annoyed) Leave Willow alone."
Buffy,What do you mean?
Dave,(insistently) That's none of your business.
Buffy,"(jumps to a conclusion) Dave, are you Malcolm?"
Dave,(turns back to the PC) Of course not. (types)
Buffy,"Dave, what's going on?"
Dave,"Look, I'll talk to you later, okay? I've got work to do."
Buffy,(exhales) So do I.
Buffy,"I'm telling you, something is going on. It's not just Willow.  Dave, Fritz, they're all wicked jumpy."
Giles,Those boys aren't sparklingly normal as it is.
Buffy,"Giles, trust me."
Giles,"I-I do! I-I-I really don't know how to advise you. Things  involved with a computer fill me with a childlike terror. Now, if it  were a nice ogre or some such I'd be more in my element. Well, I-I  suppose you could, um, tail Dave, see if he's up to something."
Buffy,"Follow Dave? What, in dark glasses and a trench coat? Please. I  can work this out myself."
Fritz,She's too close. What do I do?
Moloch,(on the monitor) Kill her.
Fritz,Party.
Buffy,"Whatever Dave is into, it's large."
Giles,What was the name of this place?
Buffy,"It said CRD. But, I couldn't get close enough to see what it  was."
Xander,"Calax Research and Development. It's a computer research lab.  Third largest employer in Sunnydale till it closed down last year. (gets  stares from the others) What, I can't have information sometimes?"
Giles,"Well, it-it's just somewhat unprecedented."
Xander,"Well, my uncle used to work there. I-in a floor sweeping  capacity."
Buffy,But it closed?
Xander,Uh-huh.
Buffy,Looked pretty functional from where I stood. I don't have a clue  what they were doing.
Xander,And what do they need Dave for?
Buffy,"Something about computers, right? I mean, he is off-the-chart  smart."
Giles,We still don't know an enormous amount. Whatever is going on  there may be on the up-and-up.
Xander,"No, if CRD opened, it would've been on the news."
Buffy,"Besides, I can just tell something's wrong. My spider sense is  tingling."
Giles,Your... spider sense?
Buffy,Pop culture reference. Sorry.
Giles,"Yes, well, ahem, I think we're still at a stand still. Uh, uh,  short of breaking into the place, I don't see..."
Buffy,Breaking in! (slides off of the table) Then this is the plan!
Xander,I'm free tonight!
Buffy,Tonight it is! (goes over to Xander)
Giles,"(tries to dampen their excitement) A moment, please, of quiet  reflection. I do not suggest that you illegally enter the..."
Giles,...data into the file so the book will be listed by title as  well as by author.
Giles,"Uh, I'm still sorting through the chaos you left behind you."
Buffy,We're literary!
Xander,To read makes our speaking English good.
Buffy,(embarrassed) We'll be going now. (grabs Xander and turns to  leave)
Giles,"Uh, w-we'll, uh, continue this conversation at another time."
Buffy,I think we're done. (they leave) (to Xander) Makes our speaking  English is good?
Xander,"(defensively) I panicked, okay?"
Malcolm,"I've never felt this way about anyone before, Willow."
Willow,I know what you mean. I feel like you know me better than  anyone.
Malcolm,I do.
Willow,Do you think we should... meet?
Malcolm,I think we should soon.
Willow,I'm nervous.
Malcolm,I'm not. Isn't that strange?
Willow,"That's what Buffy doesn't understand, how comfortable you can  make me feel."
Malcolm,Buffy just makes trouble. That's why she got kicked out of her  old school.
Willow,How did you know that?
Malcolm,It's on her permanent record.
Malcolm,You must have mentioned it.
Willow,(unsure) I guess.
Malcolm,Let's not worry about her anymore.
Willow,I have to sign off. I'll talk to you later.
Malcolm,Don't.
Willow,Bye.
Giles,(incredulous) I am no such thing.
Giles,"Nonsense! I simply don't adhere to a, a knee-jerk assumption  that because something is new, it's better."
Giles,"A society in which human interaction is all but obsolete? In  which people can be completely manipulated by technology, well, well...  Thank you, I'll pass."
Giles,These musty old books have a great deal more to say than in any  of your... fabulous web pages.
Giles,"How odd. I haven't looked through all the volumes yet, I didn't,  um..."
Giles,"(puzzled) Uh, nothing, um, a, a diary, yes. I imagine that's  what it is. (pauses to think) Well, it's been so nice talking to you.  (heads to his office with the book)"
Giles,"(absently) Must do it again sometime, yes... Bye, now."
Dave,Buffy!
Buffy,Dave! How're you doing?
Dave,"Okay. Uh, look, I'm sorry about yesterday. I haven't been getting  much sleep lately, y'know?"
Buffy,Don't sweat it.
Dave,(awkwardly) Willow was looking for you.
Buffy,"Good, I need to talk to her. Do you know where she is?"
Dave,"She said she'd be in the, in the girls' locker room."
Buffy,Great. Thanks.
Buffy,Will?
Buffy,Willow?
Buffy,Will? You taking a shower?
Buffy,I guess not.
Buffy,This is how droughts get started.
Dave,Buffy! Get out!
Dave,I can't do it! I'm not gonna do it.
Moloch,But you promised.
Dave,(desperately) Buffy isn't a threat to you! Stop with it.
Moloch,The project is almost complete. You won't have to do it again.
Dave,"(drops his bag and whimpers) Oh, I can't!"
Moloch,"I've shown you a new world, Dave. Knowledge, power... I can  give you everything. All I want is your love."
Dave,No. This isn't right. None of it is.
Xander,I'm gonna kill Dave!
Buffy,He tried to warn me.
Xander,Warn you that he set you up? (to Giles) Is she gonna be okay?
Giles,"She was only grounded for a moment. (sits and hands Buffy a mug)  Still, if you'd been anyone but the Slayer..."
Buffy,Tell me the truth: how's my hair?
Xander,It's great! It's your best hair ever! (smiles)
Giles,"Uh, oh, yes."
Buffy,I just... I don't understand what would make Dave do a thing  like that.
Giles,I think perhaps I do.
Giles,Does this look familiar to either of you?
Buffy,"Yeah, sure. Looks like a book."
Xander,I knew that one.
Giles,"(sets it on the table) In the dark ages the souls of demons were  sometimes trapped in certain volumes. They remained locked within the  book, harmless, unless the pages were read aloud. Unless I'm mistaken,  this is Moloch, the Corrupter. A very deadly and seductive demon. He  draws people to him with promises of love, power, knowledge. Preys on  impressionable minds."
Xander,Like Dave's.
Giles,"Dave, and who knows how many others."
Buffy,And Moloch is inside that book?
Giles,Not anymore. (opens the book)
Xander,You released Moloch?
Buffy,Way to go!
Giles,"I didn't read it! That dreadful Calendar woman found it and, and  it was already blank."
Buffy,"Okay, so a powerful demon with horns is walking around  Sunnydale, and nobody's noticed?"
Xander,"I-if he's so big and strong, why bother with Dave? I mean, why  didn't he just attack Buffy himself?"
Giles,I don't know. And I don't know who could've read that book. It  wasn't even in English.
Buffy,Where was it?
Giles,"Uh, in a pile with others that were, um, uh, scanned."
Xander,And that released the demon?
Buffy,"No, he's not out here. (points to the PC) He's in there."
Giles,The scanner read the book. It brought Moloch out as information  to be absorbed.
Buffy,He's gone binary on us.
Xander,"Okay, for those of us in our studio audience, who are me? You  guys are saying that Moloch is in this computer?"
Buffy,And every computer connected to it by a modem.
Giles,He's everywhere.
Xander,What are we gonna do?
Giles,"Willow scanned him into her file. It may be... a futile gesture,  but I suggest we, um, uh, delete it."
Buffy,Solid!
Xander,Don't get too close.
Buffy,"Okay. Okay. (turns on the monitor) So which file do you think it  is? Willow? (types) That's probably it, right? I'll just delete the  whole thing."
Moloch,Stay away from Willow! It is none of your business!
Buffy,So that's what Malcolm looks like.
Buffy,So much for delete file.
Giles,This is very bad.
Xander,Are we overreacting? He's in a computer! What can he do?
Buffy,You mean besides convince a perfectly nice kid to try and kill  me? I don't know. How about mess up all the medical equipment in the  world?
Giles,Randomize traffic signals.
Buffy,Access launch codes for our nuclear missiles.
Giles,Destroy the world's economy.
Buffy,I think I pretty much capped it with that nuclear missile thing.
Giles,"Right, yours was best."
Xander,"Okay, he's a threat, I'm on board with that now. But what can  we do about it?"
Buffy,"I think the first thing we do is find Willow. She's probably  talking to him right now. God, that creeps me out!"
Xander,What does he want with Willow?
Buffy,"Let's never find out. (gets up) Okay, I'm gonna check the  computer lab, and you guys call her home."
Buffy,Willow?
Xander,No answer.
Giles,Damn it!
Xander,"(hangs up) Well, it wasn't busy either, so she's not online."
Xander,(to Buffy) She's not home.
Giles,What did you find?
Xander,(worried) Willow isn't...
Buffy,Dave. He's dead.
Giles,How?
Buffy,"Well, it looks like suicide."
Xander,With a little help from my friends?
Buffy,"I'd guess Fritz. Or the other zomboids from CRD. Okay, (to  Xander) you and I are gonna go to Willow's house. Giles, you need to  come up with a way to get Moloch out of the 'Net."
Giles,"I, I have records of the ceremonies, but, but that's for a  creature of the flesh. Th-this could be something completely different."
Buffy,Then get Ms. Calendar. Maybe she can help you.
Giles,"Well, even if she could, how am I gonna convince her that  there's a demon on the Internet?"
Buffy,"Okay, fine, then you can stay here and come up with a better  plan. (to Xander) C'mon."
Willow,Mom? Dad?
PC,You have mail.
Message,No more waiting. I need you to see me.
PC,You have mail.
Willow,"Dad, did you forget your keys again?"
Fritz,No more waiting.
Radio,"A spokesman for the archbishop denied the allegations, blaming  computer error for the apparent financial discrepancy."
Giles,Binding rituals...
Radio,"In Washington D.C., the FBI today reported that all of its  serial killer profiles have been mysteriously downloaded from its  central computer."
Giles,"(turns off the radio and gets up) Um, thank you for coming. Uh,  I need your help. (laughs nervously) But before that, um, I need you to  believe something that, um, you may not want to. Uh, there's, uh...  something's got into the, um... i-i-inside, um... (takes a breath and  lets it out) There's a demon in the Internet."
Buffy,Willow?!
Xander,This isn't good.
Buffy,Willow?!
Buffy,Willow?!
Xander,"Okay, any thoughts?"
Buffy,"(reads) 'No more waiting, I need you to see me'? (to Xander) See  him how? Where?"
Xander,What about CRD?
Buffy,The research place?
Xander,I'm guessing that's Moloch central.
Buffy,Guessing that's our best lead. Let's just hope Giles can back us  up.
Giles,You already know? How exactly is that?
Giles,It's Moloch.
Giles,Uh... You don't seem exactly surprised by... Who are you?
Giles,A profession that hardly lends itself to the casting of bones.
Giles,Are you a witch?
Giles,"Well, uh, you can definitely help me. (gets the book) Um...  What's in cyberspace at the moment is less than divine."
Giles,"I have the binding rituals at hand, but I'm completely out of my  idiom."
Giles,"He was, uh, 'scanned' is the term, I believe."
Giles,Buffy!
Buffy,(cut to a pay phone outside CRD) Yeah.
Giles,Willow?
Buffy,Not at home. It looks like she was taken somewhere.
Giles,(cut to him) Where are you?
Buffy,"(cut to her) CRD. Whatever Moloch wants Willow for, it's  probably in there."
Giles,"(cut to him) Ms. Calendar and I are, uh, working to get Moloch  offline."
Buffy,(cut to her) Here's a tip: hurry! (hangs up)
Moloch,"Welcome, my love."
Moloch,I can't tell you how good it is to see you...
Moloch,...with my own two eyes.
Moloch,Willow.
Willow,(whispers) Malcolm.
Moloch,"This world is so new, so exciting. I can see all of it.  Everything flows through me. I know the secrets of your kings. But  nothing compares to having form again. To be able to walk, (puts his  hand on Fritz's head) to touch, (breaks Fritz's neck) to kill."
Xander,Back way?
Buffy,Back way.
Moloch,Here they come.
Giles,Form a circle? But there's only two of us. That's really more of  a line.
Giles,Won't Moloch just shut you down?
Giles,"Hoping and betting, that's what we've got."
Willow,I don't understand. What do you want from me?
Moloch,I want to give you the world.
Willow,(suspiciously) Why?
Moloch,You created me. I brought these humans together to build me a  body. But *you* gave me life. Took me out of the book that held me. I  want to repay you.
Willow,By lying to me? By pretending to be a person? Pretending you  loved me?
Moloch,I do!
Xander,"Uh, Buffy!"
Buffy,It's her!
Xander,"Yeah, who's the other guy?"
Moloch,Don't you see? I can give you everything! I can control the  world! Right now a man in Beijing is transferring money to a Swiss bank  account for a contract on his mother's life. Good for him!
Buffy,I can't bust it. It's heavy steel.
Xander,Then let's find another way in.
Xander,What's goin' on?
Buffy,Building's security system is computerized.
Xander,Whoops!
Giles,"Couldn't you just stop Moloch by, by entering some computer  virus?"
Giles,"Uh, I am. By the power of the divine, by the essence of the  word, I command you..."
Willow,Let me leave?
Moloch,But I love you!
Willow,Don't say that! That's a joke! You don't love anything!
Moloch,You are mine!
Willow,I'm not yours! I'm never gonna be yours! Never!
Moloch,Pity.
Giles,"By the power of the circle of Kayless, I command you... (sees  her typing) Kayless, with a 'K'."
Moloch,I'll miss you.
Giles,"Demon, come!"
Giles,I command you!
Buffy,Ow... Guy's made of metal!
Moloch,No! I won't go back!
Giles,"Demon, COME!"
Xander,Hey! I got to hit someone!
Giles,He's not in the book.
Xander,Let's go this way! (begins to run the other way)
Buffy,Wait!
Moloch,(angrily) I was omnipotent. I was everything! Now I'm trapped in this shell!
Willow,Malcolm!
Willow,"Remember me, your girlfriend?!"
Willow,"Well, I think it's time we break up!"
Willow,Or maybe we can still be friends!
Moloch,This body's all I have left. But it's enough to crush you!
Buffy,Take your best shot.
Giles,"I'm remaining calm, thank you. Uh, I just wanted to, uh, return  this. (holds up a small curly earring) I found it among the new books,  and naturally I thought of you."
Giles,"Uh, well, I'll, I'll see you anon. (begins to go)"
Giles,"(comes back in) Truthfully, I'm even less anxious to be around  computers than I used to be."
Giles,The smell.
Giles,"I know! Smell is the most powerful trigger to the memory there  is. A certain flower or a, a whiff of smoke can bring up experiences...  long forgotten. Books smell. Musty and, and, and, and rich. The  knowledge gained from a computer, is, uh, it... it has no, no texture,  no, no context. It's, it's there and then it's gone. If it's to last,  then, then the getting of knowledge should be, uh, tangible, it should  be, um... smelly."
Giles,"Well, I-I don't dangle a corkscrew from my ear."
Xander,We gonna go to the Bronze tonight? We three?
Buffy,It'll be fun!
Xander,"Yeah, Willow, fun? Remember fun? That thing where you smile?  (smiles)"
Willow,"Oh, I'm sorry guys. I'm just thinking about..."
Buffy,Malcolm?
Willow,"Malcolm, Moloch... whatever he's called. The one boy that's  really liked me, and he's a demon robot. What does that say about me?"
Buffy,It doesn't say anything about you.
Willow,"I mean, I thought I was really falling..."
Buffy,"(interrupts) Hey, did you forget? The one boy I've had the hots  for since I've moved here turned out to be a vampire."
Xander,"Right, and the teacher I had a crush on? Giant praying mantis?  (goofy smile)"
Willow,That's true. (smiles)
Xander,"Yeah, that's life on the Hellmouth."
Buffy,"Let's face it: none of us are ever gonna have a happy, normal  relationship."
Xander,We're doomed!
Willow,Yeah!
