Lyrics,<I>...this love</I>
Drusilla,"Happy Birthday, Buffy."
Angel,Hold on.
Angel,Hey. Is everything okay?
Buffy,"That's what I was gonna ask you. You're okay, right?"
Angel,Sure. I-I'm fine. (gestures for her to come in) What's up?
Buffy,Um... I-I had this... dream that Drusilla was alive.
Angel,(pulls on the shirt) What happened?
Buffy,She killed you. Right in front of me.
Angel,It was just a dream. It wasn't real.
Buffy,But it felt so real.
Angel,(puts his hand to her cheek) It wasn't. I'm right here.
Buffy,"Angel, th-this happened before. The dreams that I had about the  Master, they came true."
Angel,"(reassuringly) Still, not every dream you have comes true. I  mean, what else did you dream last night? Can you remember?"
Buffy,(looks down) I dreamt... I dreamt that Giles and I opened an  office supply warehouse in Vegas.
Angel,See my point?
Buffy,"(exhales) Yeah, I-I do, but... what if Drusilla is alive? We  never saw her body."
Angel,"(reassures) She's not. But even if she was, we'd deal."
Buffy,W-w-what if she is...
Angel,What if what?
Buffy,(whispers) I'm sorry. Were we talking?
Buffy,"I'm sorry. I, um... I-I have to go to school."
Angel,I know.
Buffy,"Oh, God, you feel..."
Angel,You have to go to school. (guides her to the door)
Buffy,Right. I know. This is me. (backs into and shuts the door) I'm  going.
Angel,You still haven't told me what you wanted for your birthday.
Buffy,(smiles) Surprise me.
Angel,(smiles) Okay. I will.
Buffy,(smiles) This is nice. I like seeing you first thing in the  morning.
Angel,It's bedtime for me.
Buffy,"Well, then I like seeing you at bedtime. Um... Um, heh...  Y-you  know what I mean."
Angel,I think so. What do you mean?
Buffy,I like seeing you. The part at the end of the night where we say  good-bye... It's getting harder.
Angel,Yeah. It is.
Willow,'I like you at bedtime?'
Willow,You actually said that?
Buffy,"I know, I know."
Willow,"Man, that's like... I-I dunno, that's moxie or something."
Buffy,Totally unplanned. It just... came out.
Willow,"(giggles) And he was into it? I mean, he wants to see you at  bedtime, too?"
Buffy,"Yeah, I, I, I think he does. Well, I, I mean he-he's cool about  it."
Willow,"Well, of course he is. 'Cause he's cool. I mean, he would  never... you know..."
Buffy,Push.
Willow,Right. H-he's not the type.
Buffy,"Will, what am I gonna do?"
Willow,What do you wanna do?
Buffy,"I don't know. I... I mean, (they sit on a bench) 'want' isn't  always the right thing *to* do. To act on want can be wrong."
Willow,True.
Buffy,But... to *not* act on want... What if I never feel this way  again?
Willow,Carpe diem. You told me that once.
Buffy,'Fish of the day'?
Willow,Not carp. (smiles) Carpe. It means 'seize the day.'
Buffy,"Right. I... I think we're going to. Seize it. Once you get to a  certain point, then seizing is sort of inevitable."
Willow,(wide-eyed) Wow...
Buffy,(smiles) Yeah.
Willow,Wow...
Buffy,Oh... (gets up and goes)
Willow,(gets up and follows) Wow!
Willow,Wow.
Buffy,(smiles) Yeah.
Buffy,"Hey, speaking of 'wow' potential, there's Oz over there. What  are we thinking, any sparkage?"
Willow,"(smiles) He's nice. Hey, I like his hands."
Buffy,Mm. A fixation on insignificant detail is a definite crush sign.
Willow,"Oh, I don't know, though. I mean, he is a senior."
Buffy,(stops) You think he's too old 'cause he's a senior? Please. My  boyfriend had a bicentennial.
Willow,That's true. (unsure) Uh... I guess... I just...
Buffy,You can't spend the rest of your life waiting for Xander to wake  up and smell the hottie. Make a move. Do the talking thing.
Willow,"Well, what if the talking thing becomes the awkward-silence  thing?"
Buffy,"Well, you won't know until you try."
Willow,Hey.
Oz,(looks up) Hey. (gives her his attention)
Willow,"Do you guys, uh, have a gig tonight?"
Oz,"Oh, no. Practice. See, our band's kinda moving towards this new  sound where... we suck, so... practice."
Willow,(smiles) I think you guys sound good.
Oz,Thanks.
Willow,I bet you have a lot of groupies.
Oz,"(nods) It happens. Now, I'm living groupie-free nowadays. I'm  clean."
Willow,(smiles) Oh. (begins to feel awkward)
Oz,"I'm gonna ask you to go out with me tomorrow night. And I'm kinda  nervous about it, actually. It's interesting."
Willow,"Oh. Well, if it helps at all, I'm gonna say yes."
Oz,"Yeah, it helps. It-it creates a comfort zone. (Willow smiles) Do  you wanna go out with me tomorrow night?"
Willow,(cringes and slaps her hand to her forehead) Oh! I can't!
Oz,"Well, see, I like that you're unpredictable."
Willow,"Oh, it's just it's Buffy's birthday, and we're throwing her a  surprise party."
Oz,It's okay.
Willow,But you could come. If you want to.
Oz,"Well, I don't wanna crash."
Willow,"No, it's fine! Well, you could be m... my date."
Oz,(nods) All right. I'm in. (smiles)
Willow,(to herself) I said 'date'.
Xander,So... Buffy's party. Manana.
Cordelia,"Well, just because she's Miss Save-The-World and everything,  you have to make a big deal? I have to cook! And everything."
Xander,You're cooking?
Cordelia,"Well, I'm chips and dips girl."
Xander,(gasps) Horrors! All that opening and stirring.
Cordelia,And shopping and carrying.
Xander,"Well, then you should have a person who does such things for  you."
Cordelia,"Well, that's what I've been saying to my father, but does he  listen?"
Xander,"Um, so, uh... You're going, and, and, and I'm going. Should...  we maybe... go?"
Cordelia,Why?
Xander,"I dunno. This... thing with us, despite our better judgment, it  keeps happening. Maybe we should just admit that we're dating."
Cordelia,Groping in a broom closet isn't dating. You don't call it a  date until the guy spends money.
Xander,"Fine. I'll spend, then we'll grope. Whatever. I just think it's  some kind of whacked that we feel we have to hide it from all our  friends."
Cordelia,"Well, of course *you* wanna tell everybody. You have nothing  to be ashamed of. I, on the other hand, have *everything* to be ashamed  of."
Xander,"You know what? 'Nuff said. Forget it. It must've been my  multiple-personality guy talking. I call him Idiot Jed, glutton for  punishment."
Giles,"Oh, good morning. (quietly) Is everything in order for the  party?"
Xander,"Absolutely. You ready to get down, you funky party weasel?"
Giles,Here comes Buffy. (to Xander) Now remember: discretion is the  better part of valor.
Xander,"You coulda just said, 'shh!' God, are all you Brits such drama  queens? (to Buffy) Buffy, I feel a pre-birthday spanking coming on."
Jenny,"I'd curb that impulse if I were you, Xander."
Xander,"(into his shirt) Check, cancel spanking."
Giles,"(sits also) You alright, Buffy? You seem a little fatigued."
Buffy,Rough night. I had a dream that Drusilla was alive and she  killed Angel. I-it just really freaked me out.
Giles,"You fear it was more of a, a... a portent?"
Buffy,"See, I don't know. I don't wanna start a big freakout over  nothing."
Giles,"Still, best to be, uh, on the alert. If Drusilla is alive, i-i- it could be a fairly... cataclysmic state of affairs."
Xander,"Again, so many words! Couldn't you just say, 'we'd be in  trouble'?"
Giles,"(gives Xander a look) Go to class, Xander."
Xander,"Gone. (gets up and starts away, but stops) Notice the economy  of phrasing: 'gone.' Simple. Direct. (points at Giles and leaves)"
Buffy,"Maybe I should get 'gone', too. (stands up)"
Giles,"(stands up) Uh, don't worry unduly, Buffy. I-I-I'm sure it's  nothing."
Buffy,"I know. I should keep my Slayer cool, but... it's Angel, which  automatically equals maxi-wig."
Giles,Hmm.
Dalton,I have your package.
Spike,Just put it on the table... near the other gifts.
Spike,"Are you dead set on this, pet? Wouldn't you rather have your  party in Vienna?"
Drusilla,But the invitations are sent.
Spike,Yeah. It's just I've had it with this place. Nothing ever comes  off like it's supposed to.
Drusilla,(leans in and puts her hands on his chest) My gatherings are  always perfect. Remember Spain? (crouches next to him) Hey... The bulls?  (walks her fingers up his arm)
Spike,"I remember, sweet. But Sunnydale's cursed for us. Angel and the  Slayer see to that."
Drusilla,Shhh... (into his ear) I've got good games for everyone.  (licks his cheek) You'll see.
Drusilla,These flowers... are wrong. (the decorators look worried)  They're all... wrong! (moans) (Spike looks worried) I can't abide them!  (screams and rips at them)
Spike,Let's try something different with the flowers then.
Drusilla,Can I open one? Can I?
Drusilla,Can I? Ooo...
Spike,"Just a peek, love."
Spike,They're for the party.
Spike,"Do you like it, baby?"
Drusilla,It reeks of death.
Drusilla,This will be the best party ever.
Spike,Why is that?
Drusilla,Because...
Drusilla,It will be the last.
Joyce,Mall trip for your birthday on Saturday. Don't forget.
Buffy,Space on a mom-sponsored shopping opportunity? Not likely.
Joyce,"Hmm. So, does, um, 17 feel any different than 16?"
Buffy,"It's funny you should ask that. (gets Joyce's attention) You  know, I woke up feeling more responsible, mature and levelheaded."
Joyce,Really? Tch. It's uncanny.
Buffy,I now possess the qualities one looks for in a... licensed  driver. (looks at her mom hopefully)
Joyce,Buffy...
Buffy,You said we could talk about it again when I was 17.
Joyce,"Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?"
Enyos,Jenny Calendar.
Jenny,You startled me.
Enyos,You look well. (steps up to her desk)
Jenny,"Yes, I'm fine. (goes around her desk) I know I haven't written  as much lately. I've been busy."
Enyos,I cannot imagine what is so important to make you ignore the  responsibility to your people.
Jenny,"Well, I've been working and..."
Enyos,(interrupts) The elder woman has been reading signs. Something  is different.
Jenny,Nothing has changed. The curse still holds.
Enyos,The elder woman is never wrong. She says his pain is lessening.  She can feel it.
Jenny,(looks down) There is...
Enyos,There is what?
Jenny,(looks up) A girl.
Enyos,(exhales in disgust) What? How could you let this happen?
Jenny,I promise you. Angel still suffers. And he makes amends for his  evil. He even saved my life.
Enyos,"So you just forget that he destroyed the most beloved daughter  of your tribe?! That he *killed* every man, woman and child that touched  her life?! Vengeance demands that his pain be eternal as ours is! If  this, this girl gives him one *minute* of happiness, it is one minute  too much!"
Jenny,I'm sorry. I thought...
Enyos,"You thought what?! You thought you are Jenny Calendar now?! You  are still Janna, of the Kalderash people! A Gypsy."
Jenny,I know... Uncle. I know.
Enyos,"Then prove it. Your time for watching is past. The girl and him,  it ends now! Do what you must to take her from him!"
Jenny,I will see to it.
Buffy,"...and then my mom broke the plate. It was just like my dream.  Every gesture, every word. (looks up at him) It was so creepy."
Giles,"Yes, well, I-I-I'd imagine it would be... fairly unnerving."
Xander,Hey! It's the woman of the hour.
Willow,It's Happy Birthday Buffy!
Willow,Not Happy Birthday Buffy?
Giles,"I-it's just that, um, part of the nightmare that Buffy had the  other night actually transpired."
Buffy,"Which means Drusilla might still be alive. Giles, in my dream, I  couldn't stop her. She blindsided me. A-Angel was gone before I knew  what happened."
Giles,"Even if she is alive, uh, we can still protect Angel. Dreams  aren't prophecies, Buffy. Y-y-y-you dreamt that the Master had risen,  but you stopped it from happening."
Xander,You ground his bones to make your bread.
Buffy,"That's true. Except for the bread part. (to Giles) Okay, so,  fine. We're one step ahead, but I wanna stay that way."
Giles,"Absolutely. (stands up) Let me read up on Drusilla, uh, see if  she has any particular patterns. (starts toward his office) Why don't  you meet me here at 7:00? We'll map out a strategy."
Buffy,What am I supposed to do until then?
Giles,"Go to classes, do your homework, have supper..."
Buffy,Right. Be *that* Buffy.
Xander,"(pointing) Well, that's not a perky birthday puppy."
Willow,So much for our surprise party. I bought little hats and  everything.
Xander,Mm-hm.
Willow,"Oh, well. I guess I'll tell Cordelia. (starts to go)"
Giles,"No, you won't. (Willow and Xander stop) We're having a party  tonight."
Xander,"(stares at Giles) Looks like Mr. Caution Man, but the sound he  makes is funny."
Giles,Buffy's surprise party will go ahead as we planned. Except I  won't be wearing the little hat.
Willow,But Buffy and Angel...
Giles,"May well be in danger... as they have been before, and, I  imagine, will be again. One thing I've learned in my tenure here on the  Hellmouth is that there is no good time to relax. And Buffy's turning 17  just this once, and she deserves a party."
Xander,You're a great man of our time.
Willow,"(smiles) And anyway, Angel's coming. So she'll be able to  protect him *and* have cake."
Giles,Precisely.
Jenny,Buffy.
Buffy,"(startled) Oh, my God, I didn't see you there."
Jenny,"Sorry. Um, Giles wanted me to tell you that there's been a  change of plans. Uh, he wants to meet you someplace near his house  'cause he had to run home and get a book or something."
Buffy,'Cause heaven knows there aren't enough books in the library.
Jenny,"Uh, he's... very thorough."
Buffy,"Oh, which is not to bag. It's kind of manly in an obsessive- compulsive kind of way, don't you think?"
Jenny,"Mm-hm. Um, you know, my car's here. Why don't I drive you?"
Buffy,Okay.
Buffy,Are we goin' to the Bronze?
Jenny,I'm not sure. Giles gave me an address. I'm just following his  directions.
Buffy,This looks funky. Stop for a sec.
Jenny,"No, Buffy, maybe you shouldn't."
Buffy,"Sorry. Sacred duty, yada yada yada."
Jenny,(sighs) What is this? (leans her head on her hand)
Buffy,"Every time I see you, you're stealing something. (Dalton growls)  You really should speak with someone about this klepto issue."
Angel,Where is she?
Willow,Shhh! I think I hear her coming.
Cordelia,Surprise!
Oz,That pretty much sums it up.
Xander,Tch.
Angel,"Buffy, are you okay?"
Giles,Yes. W-what happened?
Buffy,"(points behind her) Uh, there were these vamps outs... (looks  around) W-what's going on?"
Giles,"Oh, um... A surprise party. (blows on a party favor)"
Cordelia,Happy Birthday.
Buffy,(smiles) You guys did all this for me? (to Angel) That is so  sweet.
Angel,You sure you're okay?
Buffy,"Yes, I'm fine."
Willow,(to Oz) Are you okay?
Oz,"Yeah. Hey, did everybody see that guy just turn to dust?"
Willow,"Uh, well, uh... sort of."
Xander,Yep. Vampires are real. A lot of them live in Sunnydale.  (gestures between Willow and Oz) Willow will fill you in. (walks off)
Willow,I know it's hard to accept at first.
Oz,"Actually, it explains a *lot*."
Jenny,"Hey, can somebody give me a hand here?"
Jenny,Those creeps left this behind.
Buffy,What is it?
Giles,"I have no idea. Can, can it be opened?"
Buffy,Yeah. This looks like a release right here.
Xander,"Well, clearly the Hellmouth's answer to 'what do you get the  Slayer who has everything?'"
Giles,"Good heavens. Buffy, are you all right?"
Buffy,"Man, that thing had major grip."
Willow,W-what was that?
Oz,It looked like an arm.
Angel,It can't be. She wouldn't.
Xander,"What, uh, vamp's version of 'snakes in a can', or do you care  to share?"
Buffy,Angel?
Angel,It-it's a legend... (Giles looks at the box) way before my  time... of a demon brought forth to rid the Earth of the plague of  humanity... separate the righteous from the wicked... and to burn the  righteous down. They call him the Judge.
Giles,The Judge? This is he?
Angel,Not all of him.
Buffy,"(raising her hand) Um, still needing backstory here."
Giles,"Um... He, he, he couldn't be killed, yes? Um, a-an army was sent  against him. Most of them died... but, uh, finally they were able to  dismember him, but, uh... not kill him."
Angel,The pieces were scattered... buried in every corner of the  Earth.
Jenny,So all these parts are being brought here.
Buffy,By Drusilla. The vamps outside were Spike's men.
Angel,She's just crazy enough to do it.
Willow,"Do what, reassemble the Judge?"
Angel,And bring forth Armageddon.
Cordelia,Is anybody else gonna have cake? (goes to the pool table)
Giles,We need to get this out of town.
Jenny,Angel.
Buffy,What?
Jenny,(to Angel) You have to do it. You're the only one that can  protect this thing.
Buffy,What about me?
Jenny,"What, you're just gonna skip town for a few months?"
Buffy,'Months'?
Angel,She's right. I gotta get this to the remotest region possible.  (goes to Buffy)
Buffy,But that's not months.
Angel,"(gestures grandly) I gotta catch a cargo ship to Asia, maybe  trek to Nepal..."
Buffy,"You know, those newfangled flying machines really are much safer  than they used to be."
Angel,"I can't fly. There's no sure way to guard against the daylight.  I-I-I don't like this any more than you do, Buffy. But there's no other  choice."
Buffy,When?
Angel,Tonight. As soon as possible.
Buffy,But it's my birthday.
Jenny,(comes over) I'll drive you to the docks.
Drusilla,You lost it? You... lost my present.
Dalton,I know. I'm sorry.
Spike,"It was a bad turn, man. She can't have her fun without the box."
Dalton,The Slayer. She came out of nowhere. I didn't even see her.  She...
Drusilla,Make a wish.
Dalton,What?
Drusilla,I'm going to blow out the candles.
Spike,"You might give him a chance to find your lost treasure. He is a  wanker, but he's the only one we've got with half a brain. If he fails,  you can eat his eyes out of the sockets for all I care."
Dalton,I'll get it. Please. I swear.
Drusilla,Okay.
Drusilla,Hurry back then. (pats his head)
Angel,I should go the rest of the way alone.
Buffy,Okay.
Angel,But I'll be back. I will.
Buffy,"When? Six months, a year? You don't know how long it's gonna  take or if we'll even... (looks down)"
Angel,Hey... (raises her chin) If we'll even what?
Buffy,"(tears in her eyes) Well, if you haven't noticed, someone pretty  much always wants us dead."
Angel,Don't say that. We'll be fine.
Buffy,We don't know that.
Angel,"We can't know, Buffy. Nobody can. That's just the deal. (reaches  into his pocket) I have something for you. For your birthday. I... I was  gonna give it to you earlier, but... (shows her a ring with an intricate  design)"
Buffy,It's beautiful.
Angel,"My people -- before I was changed -- they exchanged this as a  sign of devotion. It's a claddagh ring. The hands represent friendship,  the crown represents loyalty... and the heart... Well, you know... Wear  it with the heart pointing towards you. It means you belong to somebody.  Like this."
Angel,Put it on.
Buffy,(sobs) I don't wanna do this.
Angel,Me either.
Buffy,So don't go.
Angel,Buffy... I...
Buffy,Angel! The box!
Angel,Buffy!
Giles,They should be back by now.
Willow,"Maybe Buffy needed a few minutes to pull herself together. Poor  Buffy, on her birthday and everything."
Xander,"Hmm, it's sad, granted. But let's look at the upside for a  moment. (gets up) I mean, what kind of a future would she've really had  with him? (Willow looks sadly up at him) She's got 2 jobs -- Denny's  waitress by day, (Giles looks up, too) Slayer by night -- and Angel's  always in front of the TV with a big blood belly, and he's dreamin' of  the glory days when Buffy still thought this whole creature of the night  routine was a big turnon."
Willow,You've thought way too much about this.
Xander,"No, no. That's just the beginning. Have I told you the part  where I fly into town in my private jet and take Buffy out for prime  rib?"
Willow,(sees Buffy come in) Xander...
Xander,And she cries?
Giles,(stands up) What happened? (Xander sits)
Buffy,Dru's guys ambushed us. They got the box.
Giles,Where's Jenny?
Buffy,"Uh, she took Angel to get clothing. I, I had some here."
Xander,And we needed clothes because...
Buffy,"We got wet. Giles, what do we know?"
Giles,"The more I study the Judge, the less I like him. His touch can  literally burn the humanity out of you. A true creature of evil can  survive the process. No human ever has."
Xander,"What's the problem? We send Cordy to fight this guy, and we go  for pizza. (smiles)"
Buffy,Can this guy be stopped? Without an army?
Giles,"Um, (reads) 'no weapon forged can kill him.' Not very  encouraging. If we could only stop them from assembling him."
Buffy,"We need to find his weak spots, and we need to figure out where  they'd be keeping him."
Giles,This could take time.
Willow,"Better do a round robin. Xander, you go first."
Buffy,Good call.
Giles,Round robin?
Willow,It's when everybody calls everybody else's mom and tells them  they're staying at everyone's house.
Buffy,Thus freeing us up for world saveage.
Willow,"(smiles) And all-night keggers! (gets looks from Buffy and  Giles) What, only Xander gets to make dumb jokes?"
Xander,"(on the phone) Mom, hi. Xander. Yeah, uh, Willow and I are  gonna be studying all night long, so I'm not gonna be coming home."
Xander,Tsk. I think I read this already.
Willow,I can't get over how cool Oz was about all this.
Xander,"Gee, I'm over it."
Willow,(smugly) You're just jealous 'cause you didn't have a date for  the party.
Xander,"No, I sure didn't."
Giles,(comes out into the main room) Angel? Any luck?
Giles,Sh-sh-sh.
Giles,(whispers) Seems Buffy needed some rest.
Angel,Yeah. She hasn't been sleeping well. Tossing and turning.  (everyone looks at him) She told me. Because of her dreams?
Drusilla,"Now, now."
Drusilla,Hands off my presents.
Buffy,No!
Buffy,Angel!
Angel,"Buffy, it's okay. (she turns to him) I'm here. (she hugs him  close) I'm right here."
Drusilla,More music!
Lyrics,<I>If you want to know how / To fly high then go now / To the  place where all the concubines... / Meet and converse with them / Marvel  at their pale skin / Wonder how they chew on their pointy... / Teeth and  hair are beauty / They know it's their duty / To be Countess in their  hearts and their...</I>
Spike,"Look what I have for you, ducks."
Lyrics,<I>Minds that have to whisper / See in them a sister / Look into  their eyes and you'll become / Transylvanian Concubine</I>
Drusilla,Ahh... The best is saved for last.
Lyrics,<I>You know what flows there like wine / Sorrow is their master /  Cackling with laughter / Now he's having just one piece of...</I>
Lyrics,<I>Cakey is their make up / Catholics try to shake up...</I>
Drusilla,(smiles) Hmm.
Drusilla,"He's perfect, my darling."
Drusilla,Just what I wanted.
Drusilla,Goll...
Judge,You!
Spike,"(rolls over to him in Dru's defense) Ho, ho, ho. What's that,  mate?"
Judge,You two stink of humanity. You share affection and jealousy.
Spike,Yeah. What of it? (taps his armor) Do I have to remind you that  we're the ones who brought you here?
Drusilla,(smiles) Would you like a party favor? (indicates her guests)
Judge,This one is full of feeling. He reads. Bring him to me.
Spike,What's with the bringing? I thought you could just zap people.
Judge,My full strength will return in time. Until then... I need  contact.
Dalton,No. No! NO!
Drusilla,(gasps) (gleefully) Do it again! Do it again!
Giles,"Buffy, what's happening?"
Angel,She had another dream.
Buffy,I think I know where Spike and Drusilla are.
Giles,"(comes down the stairs) That's very good, however, you, you do  need a plan. I-I know you're concerned, Buffy, but you can't just go off  half-cocked."
Buffy,"I have a plan. Angel and I go to the factory and do recon,  figure out how far they've gotten assembling the Judge. You guys check  any places the boxes could be coming into town. Shipping yards,  airports, anything. We need to stop them from getting all the boxes in  one place."
Giles,"Yes. Yes, well, um, actually, that's quite a good plan."
Buffy,"This thing is nasty, and it's real, Giles. We can't wait for it  to come get us."
Giles,Right.
Buffy,I saw this. (whispers) The party.
Spike,What? What is it?
Angel,We gotta get outta here.
Spike,"Well, well. Look what we have here. Crashers."
Buffy,I'm sure our invitations just got lost in the mail.
Drusilla,It's delicious. (licks her fingers) (to Angel) I only dreamed  you'd come. Rrrr.
Angel,(struggles) Leave her alone.
Spike,"Yeah, that'll work. Now say 'pretty please'. (smiles)"
Judge,The girl.
Drusilla,"Chilling, isn't it? She's so full of good intention."
Angel,Take me!
Buffy,No!
Angel,Take me instead of her!
Spike,"(raises his hand) Uh, you're not clear on the concept, pal.  There is no instead. Just first and second."
Drusilla,"And if you go first, you don't get to watch the Slayer die."
Angel,Don't touch him!
Buffy,This way!
Drusilla,Go!
Angel,Come on. We need to get inside.
Angel,You're shaking like a leaf.
Buffy,Cold.
Angel,Let me get you something.
Angel,"Put these on. Get under the covers, just to warm up."
Angel,Sorry.
Angel,What?
Buffy,"Oh, um... It's okay. I just have a cut or something."
Angel,Can I... Lemme see.
Buffy,(whispers) Okay.
Angel,It's already closed. You're fine.
Buffy,You almost went away today.
Angel,We both did.
Buffy,"(sobs) Angel... (sniffles) I feel like I lost you... (sniffles)  You're right, though. We can't be sure of anything."
Angel,Shhh. I...
Buffy,You what?
Angel,"I love you. I try not to, but I can't stop."
Buffy,"Me, me, too. I can't either."
Angel,"Buffy, maybe we shouldn't..."
Buffy,(stops him) Don't. Just kiss me.
Angel,Ahh!
Angel,Buffy!
Angel,Buffyyyyy!
