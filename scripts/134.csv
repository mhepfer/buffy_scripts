BUFFY,"<br>    OK, Spike. (he lets Vi go; she walks up to Molly and Kennedy who are standing     near Buffy) You're right. You don't have slayer strength. But that doesn't     mean that you're not strong. You have inherent abilities that others do not     have."
MOLLY,"<br>    (taking notes on a pad) Not like you do."
BUFFY,"<br>    No, not yet, but it's there. You have the potential. You have strength, speed,     instinct. You just have to learn to trust yourself. Rona, what did your instincts     tell you to do just then?"
RONA,"<br>    (half-heartedly) Block his attack, keep him off balance, gain the advantage...?"
BUFFY,"<br>    No, they didn't."

VI,"<br>    (rubbing her wrist) They told me to run. They're still sort of telling me     to run."
BUFFY,"<br>    Don't fight on his terms. Your gut's telling them to run, run. OK? Regain     the higher ground. Make the fight your own. Spike, what did your instincts     tell you to do just then?"
SPIKE,"<br>    Hunt. Kill."
BUFFY,"<br>    (walks out in front of the girls) Come at me, (Spike raises his eyebrows and     smiles a little) full speed. (to slayers-in-training) He needs to kill to     live. That tells you everything you need to know."

VI,"<br>    You're saying demon, and I don't mean to ... Oh, bananas! Imagine yourself     covered in human viscera.... (Molly and Vi giggle and squeal as they continue     talking)"
BUFFY,"<br>    You're all gonna die. But you knew that already. (paces in front of them)     'Cause that's the cool reward for being human. Big dessert at the end of the     meal. Don't kid yourselves, you guys. This whole thing is all about death.     (stands still) You think you're different 'cause you might be the next slayer?     Death is what a slayer breathes, what a slayer dreams about when she sleeps.     Death is what a slayer lives. My death could make you the next slayer. (walks     back to retrieve her axe from the target) Oh, goody. Rapt attention. I love     that so much. (pulls out the axe) Now, where was I? Ah. (sets down the axe,     walks back to the front) If we go with what Anya's resources are telling us,     then The First is in remission for a while, which we think means advantage     us."
RONA,"<br>    Well, what does that mean? About The First?"
BUFFY,"<br>    (crosses her arms) As best we can tell, he&#151;or precisely &quot;it&quot;&#151;was     putting a lot of stock in that UberVamp thing, the Chaka Khan."
DAWN,"<br>    (from the stairs) Turok-Han?"
BUFFY,"<br>    (doesn't acknowledge Dawn, pacing) So when I kicked its ass, the whole Firsty     circus decided to back off for a while. Good news? Means we probably don't     have to worry about it pulling Spike's strings for a while. (stands still)     Here's the half-empty. Time away means time to regroup. And part of that regrouping     is coming back stronger than ever. The odds are against us. Time is against     us. And some of us will die in this battle. Decide now that it's not going     to be you. (walks closer to the girls) I know you're all tired, far away from     home, anxious. But you're all special. Most people in this world have no idea     why they're here or what they want to do. You do. You have a mission, a reason     for being here. You're not here by chance. You're here because you are the     chosen ones. (turns, walks upstairs, commenting on the way) Dawn, you better     hurry up and eat something so you're not late for school."

AMANDA,"<br>    Do people ever think you're weird?"

AMANDA,"<br>    I feel like people think I'm weird, and so they pick on me. But I might be&#151;weird."
BUFFY,"<br>    (chuckles) Amanda, why do you think that you're weird?"
AMANDA,"<br>    One of the boys who picks on me, I kind of&#151;See, if a guy picks on you,     is it weird to think he's cute?"

AMANDA,"<br>    It's just, the last few times I've seen him, I've wanted to, you know, pick     on him....extra. More."
BUFFY,"<br>    (stifles a laugh) Uh-huh."
AMANDA,"<br>    The thing is, I can't tell. My mom says when a guy teases you, it means he     likes you."
BUFFY,"<br>    (nods) Sometimes that's true."
AMANDA,"<br>    Is it weird? We're mean to each other, and we like each other."
BUFFY,"<br>    Well, it depends. Sometimes that's how people relate. Being mean to each other.     Even mortal enemies&#151; (increasingly emphatic) Then with the&#151; And     that leads to no good, absolutely no good. And much confusion. A-and then     it's over.

Amanda's face is one of sheer horror as two Bringers have her by the     arms and a third comes at her with a knife. Dawn stands and lights a gas jet     on one of the tables nearest the Bringers, causing a brief explosion and knocking     them down. </b>"
DAWN,"<br>    (picks up the jagged broken flagpole) Amanda!"
Cut to:,"</p>  <p><b>45INT.HALLWAY     AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT<br>    Amanda and Dawn are running down the hallway. Dawn's still carrying the flagpole     shard. They stop running when they get to the top of the stairs.</b>"
AMANDA,"<br>    (out of breath) What were those?"
DAWN,"<br>    Amanda, listen to me. Remember when you said I was special? Well, I'm not.     But the thing is, you are. This is your battle, Amanda."
AMANDA,"<br>    (shaking her head) No, I can't."
DAWN,"<br>    You can! You've got to. Look, I've got your back, but this is something you     have to do. It's something you were born to do. (Bringers have found them     and are approaching from the other end of the hall; Dawn hands Amanda the     flagpole) Here, this belongs to you."
XANDER,"<br>    Buffy, up here."
BUFFY,"<br>    (stabs a Bringer with his own knife, then to Spike) Here! (hands the knife     to Spike)"
AMANDA,"<br>    (to Buffy) OK. One minute I'm in Swing Choir, and the next&#151; What the     hell's going on? You tell me to come to you with problems. Turns out, a vampire     attacked me. Problem. So I go to your house, and when I get there, this orange     cloud hits me."
DAWN,"<br>    (to Xander) She was at the doorway."
AMANDA,"<br>    And I don't know if you're into the drugs, but that's not my deal, all right.     That cloud hit me, and I got a little dizzy and discombobulated."
DAWN,"<br>    It was Willow's spell. She's the potential slayer."

RONA,"<br>    I'm sure the vampire thought we were like, what, four helpless girls. And     then Vi&#151;Vi actually yells, &quot;We're just four helpless girls.&quot;"
VI,"<br>    That was part of my plan. (Kennedy rolls her eyes playfully at Vi)"
RONA,"<br>    When it all started going down, it was like we knew what we were doing. For     real."
MOLLY,"<br>    (to Rona) Yeah, like when you dodged that first attack, and then cracked him     across the jaw."
RONA,"<br>    Aw, no, no, no, no, no. (to Molly) See, I wouldn't have been able to do that     if you hadn't've pulled his legs out."
VI,"<br>    I hurt his arm. (nods proudly) Yep. And an arm can be as lethal as a mouth."
MOLLY,"<br>    (to Kennedy) When you staked him, seriously, the rush was like&#151;"
KENNEDY,"<br>    (to Amanda) So you took one out solo?"
MOLLY,"<br>    Yeah, what was that like?"
AMANDA,"<br>    I don't know. I mean, when I saw the vampire, vamp&#151;"
KENNEDY,"<br>    Vampire's good too."
AMANDA,"<br>    Cool. Yeah, when that vampire attacked me, I felt this kind of charge, you     know?"
KENNEDY (O.S.),"<br>    Like you realize in one instant that your whole life is different."
AMANDA (O.S.),"<br>    Exactly. It's that rush you're talking about."
BUFFY,"<br>    (walks up to Dawn from the kitchen, followed by Xander) Hey. (Dawn turns to     face her, puts on a happy face) You OK?"
DAWN,"<br>    (nods) Yeah, I was thinking of hitting the books. Do some research on The     First. It's in retreat mode right now, but you're still gonna need to know     how to fight it."
BUFFY,"<br>    (nods) Great. Sounds good. (to the slayers-in-training) Hey, you guys, wanna     head downstairs? Get our newest arrival up to speed?"
DAWN,"<br>    (looking over her shoulder, to Xander) What's up?"
XANDER,"<br>    (walks into the room) Aw, I'm just thinking about the girls. It's a harsh     gig, being a potential. Just being picked out of a crowd, danger, destiny,     (grins) plus if you act now, death."
DAWN,"<br>    They can handle it."
XANDER,"<br>    Yeah. (sits in a chair in front of the desk) They're special, no doubt. The     amazing thing is, not one of them will ever know, not even Buffy."
DAWN,"<br>    Know what?"
XANDER,"<br>    How much harder it is for the rest of us."
DAWN,"<br>    No way. They've got&#151;"
XANDER,"<br>    Seven years, Dawn. Working with the slayer. Seeing my friends get more and     more powerful. A witch. A demon. Hell, I could fit Oz in my shaving kit, but     come a full moon, he had a wolfy mojo not to be messed with. Powerful. All     of them. And I'm the guy who fixes the windows."
DAWN,"<br>    Well, you had that sexy army training for a while, and&#151;and the windows     really did need fixing."
XANDER,"<br>    I saw what you did last night."
DAWN,"<br>    Yeah, I&#151; (shakes her head embarrassed) I guess I kinda lost my head when     I thought I was the slayer."
XANDER,"<br>    You thought you were all special. Miss Sunnydale 2003. And the minute you     found out you weren't, you handed the crown to Amanda without a moment's pause.     You gave her your power."
DAWN,"<br>    (shrugs) The power wasn't mine."
XANDER,"<br>    They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie, to be the one who isn't chosen.     To live so near to the spotlight and never step in it. But I know. I see more     than anybody realizes because nobody's watching me. I saw you last night.     I see you working here today. You're not special. You're extraordinary. (stands,     kisses her forehead, stands to walk out of the room)"
DAWN,"<br>    (tears welling in her eyes, calls after him) Maybe that's your power."
XANDER,"<br>    (pauses at the door) What?"
DAWN,"<br>    Seeing. Knowing."
XANDER,"<br>    Maybe it is. Maybe I should get a cape."
DAWN,"<br>    Cape is good."
XANDER,"<br>    Yeah. (leaves the room)"
