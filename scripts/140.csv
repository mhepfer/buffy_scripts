GIRL,"<br>    (panting) Thank you. Thank God you were there."
MAN,"<br>    Well, let's not give him credit for everything. (smiles) No, I'm funning you.     I don't believe it was a coincidence. I also don't believe young girls should     be out in the woods late at night&#151;should be tucked in bed."

CALEB,"<br>    Now, I know what you're thinking. Crazy preacher man spoutin' off at the mouth     about the whore of Babylon or some-such. That ain't me. I'm not here to lecture     you. I mean, what's the point? (presses in his dashboard cigarette lighter)     My words just curdle in your ears. Wouldn't take in a thing. (Shannon looks     around nervously, looks out the window) Head's filled with so much filth that     ain't no room for words of truth. Well, you know what you are, Shannon? Dirty."
SHANNON,"<br>    (offended) What? I'm not! What're&#151;"
CALEB,"<br>    Now, now, now. There's no blame here. You were born dirty, born without a     soul. Born with that gaping maw wants to open up, suck out a man's marrow.     Makes me puke to think too hard on it. (Shannon touches the passenger side     door, trying to open it, but there's no handle) Yeah, that there door's problematical.     I don't know as I could recommend steppin' out at this speed anyway. You're     like as not to tumble some. But, of course, there's my boys back there&#151;Ooh,     they hate to miss a mark."
SHANNON,"<br>    (shocked) Your boys?"
CALEB,"<br>    Well, they ain't exactly my &quot;blue eyed boys&quot; but they're hard workers.     And they don't truck with Satan&#151;that was just me having fun. (looks at     Shannon) Satan is a little man.

SHANNON,"<br>    (sees what Caleb's doing, and cowers) Please...don't hurt me."
CALEB,"<br>    Well, now, is this the part where you offer to do anything? Because I tried     to make it clear&#151;you got nothin' I want to explore."
CALEB,"<br>    Oh yeah. That's it! That's a cleansing fire. Hallelujah! Now, if I'm not mistaken,     there's a car a little ways behind us, and I do believe there's some folk     in it goin' the same place you are. Now, I want you to deliver a message for     me, but it's not for them. It's for the other one&#151;the one and only, the     original, accept-no-substitutes slayer. Would you tell her something for me?"
SHANNON,"<br>    (frightened) Yes."

CALEB,"<br>    Just another dirty girl. And, since you only dress up in dead folk, I'm guessing,     one who's already been paid her wage."
BUFFY/FIRST,"<br>    Look hard. What do you see?"

CALEB,"<br>    (reaches toward her) At long last. (tries to touch her face, but his hand     goes through her head) All this time. All the work I've done for you... Blowing     up the Council, organizing the Ray Charles Brigade, and stickin' all them     splits&#151;you never showed me."
BUFFY/FIRST,"<br>    Well, you've earned it. And you'll be meeting her soon. Am I right?"
CALEB,"<br>    Oh, yeah. Yeah, she'll get the message."
BUFFY/FIRST,"<br>    And what makes you so sure she'll come?"
CALEB,"<br>    (points, nods) Curiosity. Woman's first sin. I offer her an apple. What can     she do but take it? (grins, gestures &quot;cheers&quot; with his glass) I'll     see you soon."

RONA,"<br>    Look, I know, but... (sighs) this plan is trouble. OK, Buffy doesn't care     how many of us she puts in danger&#151;"
XANDER,"<br>    Let me tell you something about Buffy. In fact, you should all listen to this."
KENNEDY,"<br>    Uh, we kinda were."
XANDER,"<br>    I've been through more battles with Buffy than you all can ever imagine. She's     stopped everything that's ever come up against her. (Buffy and Faith walk     through the front door and overhear Xander's speech) She's laid down her life&#151;literally&#151;to     protect the people around her. This girl has died two times, and she's still     standing. You're scared? That's smart. You got questions? You should. But     you doubt her motives, you think Buffy's all about the kill, then you take     the little bus to battle. (Buffy tears up) I've seen her heart, and this time&#151;not     literally. And I'm telling you, right now, she cares more about your lives     than you will ever know. You gotta trust her. She's earned it."
FAITH,"<br>    Damn. I never knew you were that cool. (everyone turns to look at Buffy and     Faith)"
BUFFY,"<br>    Well, you always were a little slow."
FAITH,"<br>    I get that now."
BUFFY,"<br>    All right, let's saddle up."

BUFFY,"<br>    OK. Set up a perimeter. Guard the door. I don't want anything getting in behind     us. My team goes in first, we check the place out. You guys are our safety-net.     If this place is a trap, we give the signal, you guys come in, guns a-blazing."
XANDER,"<br>    So, what's the signal?"
BUFFY,"<br>    I'm thinking lots and lots of yelling."
XANDER,"<br>    Got it."
BUFFY,"<br>    Shall we?"

MOLLY,"<br>    (looking around) What is this place?"
BUFFY,"<br>    Looks like an old vineyard."
KENNEDY,"<br>    An evil vineyard, huh?"
SPIKE,"<br>    Like Falcon Crest."
BUFFY,"<br>    (looking in the shadows) Stay alert, you guys. Bringers are here somewhere.     Just need to find out where."
SPIKE,"<br>    Shouldn't be too hard."
CALEB,"<br>    Well, now, you girls are just burning with righteousness, aren't you? Problem     is, you think you're blazing like suns, when really you're burning like matchsticks     in the face of the darkness. You having fun? Now, I hope my boys haven't worn     you out too much&#151;I need you fit for when I purify you."
BUFFY,"<br>    Save the sermon, padre. I heard you have something of mine."
CALEB,"<br>    (chuckles) Well, I do now. You liked my little message, did you? You know,     I ruined a perfectly good knife on that girl. Got her soiled blood all over     the place. I may have to get a new truck. (Buffy looks taken aback) So, you're     the slayer. The slayer. The strongest, the fastest, the most aflame with that     most precious invention of all mankind&#151;the notion of goodness. The slayer     must indeed be powerful. (with one powerful punch, he sends Buffy flying across     the room) So, what else you got? (looks around smugly)"

KENNEDY,"<br>    Let's go!"
RONA,"<br>    (worried) Kennedy!"
CALEB,"<br>    (to Rona) Miss, I do believe you have your own problems you should be worrying     about."
CALEB,"<br>    Oh, good. There's more of you."
XANDER,"<br>    Buffy!"
CALEB,"<br>    (looks Faith up and down) Well, you're the other one, aren't you. Your Cain     to her Abel. (Faith throws a knife at Caleb) No offense meant to Cain, of     course."
FAITH,"<br>    (through gritted teeth) Never was much for the good book."
CALEB,"<br>    Oh, it has its moments. Paul had some good stuff, for instance. But overall     I find it a tad complicated (slaps Faith). I like to keep things simple. (kicks     Faith across the room into a stack of wine barrels) Good folk, bad folk, (a potential with long black hair swings at Caleb, but he grabs hersword, then her face) clean folk, dirty     folk..."
MOLLY,"<br>    (seeing Caleb kill the potential) No...!"
CALEB,"<br>    Yes. (walks toward Molly)"
BUFFY,"<br>    (weakly trying to sit up) Xander, get them out of here. We have to retreat.     Do it."
CALEB,"<br>    (to Molly) What can I say? I work in mysterious ways. (stabs Molly, lets go     of her neck, dropping her to the ground) Also some fairly straightforward     ones."
SPIKE,"<br>    (grabs Buffy's arm) We're all leaving."
XANDER,"<br>    (to Kennedy) Are you OK? (Kennedy nods) Let's go. Come on."
XANDER,"<br>    (waving to the others) Let's go! Come on!"
CALEB,"<br>    You're the one who sees everything, aren't you? (rears his hand back in front     of Xander's face) Well, let's see what we can't do about that."
