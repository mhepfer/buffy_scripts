Willow,(smiles) Hi.
Oz,"(straightens up) Oh, that's what I was gonna say."
Willow,What cha looking at? (looks into the case)
Oz,(points) This cheerleading trophy. (moves and watches) It's like  its eyes follow you wherever you go. I like it.
Willow,So did you like the movie last night?
Oz,"I don't know. T-today's movies are kind of like popcorn. You know,  you forget about them as soon as they're done. I do remember I liked the  popcorn, though. (stops walking)"
Willow,"(smiles) Yeah, it was good. And I had a really fun time with  the rest. (gets a confused look from Oz) I mean, the part with you."
Oz,"Oh, that's great. Uh, my time was also of the good."
Willow,"Mine, too. (awkwardness sets in) Well, then..."
Willow,"Oh, there. (points) I have my friend. So I will go to her.  (goes)"
Oz,"I'll see you then. Uh, later. (smiles)"
Larry,"Man! Oz, I would love to get me some of that Buffy and Willow  action, if you know what I mean. (laughs)"
Oz,"(nods) That's great, Larry. You've really mastered the single  entendre."
Girl,Hey!
Larry,Oops!
Larry,"Ohhh! Oh, thank you, Thighmaster! (laughs)"
Larry,"So, Oz, man, what's up with that? Dating a junior? Uh, let me  guess. That little innocent schoolgirl thing is just, uh, just an act,  right?"
Oz,"Yeah. Yeah, she's actually an evil mastermind. It's fun."
Larry,"I mean, she's gotta be putting out, or what's the point? What  are you gonna do, talk? (laughs) Come on, fess up. How far have you  gotten?"
Willow,"Nowhere. I mean, he said he was gonna wait until I was ready,  but I'm ready. Honest. I'm good to go here."
Buffy,"Well, I think it's nice that he's not just being an animal."
Willow,It is nice. He's great. We have a lot of fun. But I want  smoochies!
Buffy,Have you dropped any hints?
Willow,I've dropped anvils.
Buffy,"Ah, he'll come around. What guy could resist your wily Willow  charms?"
Willow,"At last count, all of them. Maybe more."
Buffy,"Well, none of them know a thing. They all get an 'F' in Willow."
Willow,"But I want Oz to get an 'A', and, oh, one of those gold stars."
Buffy,He will.
Willow,"Well, he better hurry. I don't want to be the only girl in  school without a real boyfriend."
Willow,"Oh, I'm such an idiot. I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't even be talking  about... Do you want me to go away?"
Buffy,I wish you wouldn't.
Willow,How are you holding up anyway?
Buffy,I'm holding. I was going on two minutes there without thinking  about Angel.
Willow,"(trying to be cheerful) Well, there you go."
Buffy,But I would do a lot better if you and Xander and I could do  that 'sharing our misery' thing tonight.
Willow,"Great. I'll give Xander a call. What's his number? Oh, yeah, 1- 800-I'm-Dating-A-Skanky-Ho. (rolls her eyes)"
Buffy,(surprised) Meow!
Willow,(smiles) Really? Thanks. I've never gotten a 'meow' before.
Buffy,Well-deserved.
Willow,"Darn tootin'. I'm just saying Xander and Cordelia? I mean, what  does he see in her anyway?"
Xander,But what could she possibly see in him?
Cordelia,Excuse me? We didn't come here to talk about Willow. We came  here to do things I can never tell my father about because he still  thinks I'm a... good girl.
Xander,"I just don't trust Oz with her. I mean, he's a senior, he's  attractive -- okay, maybe not to me, but -- and he's in a band. And we  know what kind of element that attracts."
Cordelia,I've dated lots of guys in bands.
Xander,(nods) Thank you.
Cordelia,Do you even wanna be here?
Xander,I'm not running away.
Cordelia,"Because when you're not babbling about poor, defenseless  Willow, you are *raving* about the all-powerful Buffy."
Xander,"I do not babble. I occasionally run-on, every now and then I  yammer..."
Cordelia,Xander?
Xander,Yeah?
Cordelia,"Look around. We're in my daddy's car, it's just the two of  us, there is a beautiful, big full moon outside tonight. It doesn't get  more romantic than this. (insistent) So shut up!"
Xander,Did you hear that?
Cordelia,What is it now?
Xander,I thought I heard something.
Cordelia,I-is Willow sending out some sorta distress signal that only  *you* can hear?
Xander,Huh.
Xander,"Okay, now I *know* I heard something."
Cordelia,"Alright, that's it. You know, your mind hasn't been here all  night. How about I just drop you off..."
Xander,Get us outta here!
Cordelia,(screams) Where are the keys?
Xander,We should be moving! Let's go!
Cordelia,"(finds the keys) Oh, I got 'em! Got 'em!"
Xander,Told ya I heard something.
Buffy,And you're sure it was a werewolf? (gets off of the car)
Xander,"Well, let's see, um, six feet tall, claws, a big old snout in  the middle of his face like a wolf. Um, yeah, I'm sticking with my first  guess."
Oz,Seems wise.
Xander,"Oh, oh, and then there was that little thing where it tried to  bite us."
Cordelia,It was so awful. (puts her head on Xander's shoulder)
Xander,(puts his arm around her) I know.
Cordelia,(tears herself away) Daddy just had this car detailed.
Buffy,So what's the word?
Giles,"Well, it seems there were a, a number of other attacks by a wild  dog around town. (hands the paper to Buffy) Several animal carcasses  were found mutilated."
Willow,"You mean, like bunnies and stuff? (upset) No, don't tell me.  (looks at Oz)"
Oz,"(reassuringly) Oh, don't worry. I mean, they might not look it, but  bunnies can really take care of themselves."
Willow,(calmer and smiling) Yeah.
Oz,Yeah.
Giles,"(takes the paper back) Yes, uh, um, fortunately, no people were  injured."
Buffy,That falls into the 'that's a switch' column.
Giles,"Well, for now. But my guess is that this werewolf will be back  at next month's full moon."
Willow,What about tonight's full moon?
Giles,(confused) Pardon?
Willow,"Well, last night was the night before the full moon,  traditionally known as... 'the night before the full moon.'"
Giles,Meaning the accepted legend that werewolves only prowl during a  full moon might be erroneous.
Cordelia,Or it could be a crock.
Xander,Unless the werewolf was using last year's almanac.
Buffy,Looks like Giles has some schooling to do.
Giles,"Yes, I must admit I, I am intrigued. Werewolves, it's... it's  one of the classics. (start away) I, I'm sure my books and I are in for  a fascinating afternoon. (leaves)"
Buffy,He needs to get a pet.
Coach,"Sunnydale is becoming more dangerous all the time. And a full  moon like tonight tends to bring out the crazies, but with some simple  basics of self-defense each of you can learn how to protect yourself."
Buffy,(quietly to Willow) Here's a suggestion: move away from the  Hellmouth.
Coach,What you wanna do is gain advantage of the situation as quickly  as possible.
Oz,Tag. (pats her on the back)
Coach,Your attacker may have the benefit of surprise.
Xander,Would you look at that? He's all over her.
Coach,"But if you plot ahead,..."
Xander,"Psst! Hey, buddy, this is a public forum here."
Coach,...then you can turn that advantage to yourself.
Cordelia,I think you splashed on just a little too much 'Obsession For  Dorks'.
Coach,"By being prepared, you have the power. Okay, everyone get into  your assigned groups."
Xander,What happened?
Larry,"Oh, last week some huge dog jumped out of the bushes and bit me.  Thirty-nine stitches. They oughta shoot those strays."
Oz,"(next to Larry) I've been there, man. (holds up his finger) My  cousin Jordy just got his grownup teeth in? Does not like to be tickled."
Larry,(into her ear) Theresa! (she straightens up) Be still my shorts.  We're in the same group. (chuckles and nods) I may have to attack you.
Theresa,"No, a-a-actually, I think, uh, in our group there are a few of  us."
Buffy,(joins Theresa) And I'm one of the few.
Willow,"Don't forget, you're supposed to be a meek little girlie-girl  like the rest of us. (walks off)"
Buffy,(looks at Larry) Spoil my fun.
Coach,"Okay, everyone, listen up. I wanna show you what to do should  you be attacked from behind. (looks at Buffy) In this situation, bend  forward, using your back and shoulders (bends her over to demonstrate)  to flip the assailant over to the ground."
Buffy,Uhh! Uhh!
Larry,"Oh, Summers, you are turning me on."
Oz,"(points) That works, too."
Giles,"And, uh, while there's absolutely no scientific explanation for  lunar effect on the human psyche, uh, the phases of the moon, uh, do  seem to exert a great deal of psychological influence. And th-the full  moon is, is, seems to bring out our darkest qualities."
Xander,"And yet, ironically, uh, led to the invention of the moon pie."
Giles,"(gets the joke) Oh... (chuckles) Yes, the moon pie. (laughs  harder) (gets looks from Buffy and Willow) Y-you see, uh, the-the  werewolf, uh, is such a, a potent e-e-extreme representation of our  inborn animalistic traits that it e-emerges for three full consecutive  nights: the full moon and, uh, the two nights surrounding it."
Xander,Quite the party animal.
Giles,"Quite. And it, uh, acts on-on pure instinct. No conscience, uh,  uh, predatory and, and aggressive."
Buffy,"In other words, your typical male."
Xander,"On behalf of my gender, hey."
Giles,"Yes, let's not jump to any conclusions."
Buffy,"I didn't jump. I took a tiny step, and there conclusions were."
Giles,"The point is that our wolfman could also be a-a-a wolfwoman, or- or anyone who was bitten by a werewolf."
Xander,So then I'm guessing your standard silver bullets are in order  here?
Giles,"No. No bullets. No matter who this werewolf is, i-it's still a  human being, who may be completely unaware of his or her condition."
Buffy,So tonight we bring 'em back alive.
Giles,(quietly) Anything yet?
Buffy,"(quietly) Yes. And you won't believe what I saw. Brittany Podell  was making out with Owen Stadeel, but he goes with Barrett Williams.  (gets a look from Giles) If she ever found... No, um, no, no sign of the  werewolf. How about you?"
Giles,"Uh, the same. (looks around) I thought we might, uh... I thought  we might knock on a few windows, uh, ask if anyone has seen anything  yet."
Buffy,"(gives him a look) Giles, no one's seen anything."
Giles,"Oh, yes. No, of-of-of course not, no. Yes."
Cain,Gotcha!
Cain,What the hell?
Buffy,(yells) Giles! Giles!
Giles,(comes running) Hey! (sees Cain with his gun) Whoa! (holds his  arms up)
Cain,Hands are good right about there.
Giles,"Who, who are you? What are you doing?"
Cain,"The name's Cain. I'm the one with the gun, which means I'm the  one who gets to do the interviewing."
Buffy,"Ahem. Hey, before we get all chummy here, how about we do  something about me being in this net thing?"
Giles,You alright?
Buffy,Yeah. (gets up)
Cain,"(sees Buffy clearly now) Gotta say, I'm impressed."
Giles,Excuse me?
Cain,"Well, it's good to get the fruit while it's fresh."
Giles,You'd be wise to take that back.
Cain,"Hey, what a man and a girl do in lovers' lane at night is  nobody's busi..."
Buffy,"Oh, okay, hey, enough, repulsive brain. It's not what you think.  (looks at Giles) We're hunting werewolves."
Buffy,"Okay, it's funny if you don't believe in werewolves."
Cain,"No, it's funny thinking about you two catching one. I mean, this  guy looks like he's auditioning to be a librarian, and, you, well,  you're a girl."
Giles,I assure you she's quite capable.
Cain,"Uh-huh. Lemme ask you something, sweetheart. Exactly how many of  these animals have you taken out?"
Buffy,As of today?
Cain,I tore a tooth from the mouth of every werewolf that I killed.  (holds out his necklace) This next one will bring the total to an even  dozen.
Buffy,So you're just gonna kill it?
Cain,"Well, see, that's the thing. Their pelts fetch a pretty penny in  Sri Lanka, and it's a little hard to skin 'em when they're alive."
Giles,Y-you hunt werewolves f-for sport?
Cain,"No, no, I'm in it purely for the money."
Buffy,And it doesn't bother you that a werewolf is a person twenty- eight days out of the month?
Cain,"That's why I only hunt 'em the other three. I'd really love to  stay and chat, (crouches down to collect the net) but I'm on a tight  schedule. Any idea where else the boys and girls like to get together  around here?"
Buffy,You're looking for a party?
Cain,"No, but the werewolf is. They're suckers for that whole sexual  heat thing. Sense it miles away. Since this little doggie ain't here, I  guess he found another place. (stands up)"
Buffy,Sorry. Wish I could help you.
Cain,"But you don't know squat? (shakes his head) Gee, what a surprise.  (leaves)"
Giles,Where are we going?
Buffy,I think I know where to look. We just have to make it there  before mein furrier.
Angelus,Everything okay? (twirls a daisy)
Theresa,"Yeah, I just, uh, I, I thought I heard something... behind me."
Angelus,No one there.
Theresa,Oh. I guess I was wrong. I could have sworn that...
Angelus,"It's okay. It can get pretty scary out here, all alone at  night."
Theresa,Yeah.
Angelus,"Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Don't you go to school  with Buffy?"
Theresa,"Oh, you know Buffy? (smiles)"
Angelus,"(chuckles) Yes, I do, very well."
Theresa,(keeps smiling) Oh.
Angelus,"Come on, I'll get you home."
Lyrics,<I>And then sweep this town into a Monster Truck of shame / Carved  out of soap and steel and clay and salty fame / You are the first to  look away and against me / You shake the squirrel out your tree</I>
Cordelia,"I mean, with Xander it's always, 'Buffy did this', 'Willow  said that'. Buffy, Buffy. Willow, Willow. It's like I don't even exist.  (leans back and folds her arm)"
Willow,I sometimes feel like that. (looks over at Cordelia)
Cordelia,"And then when I call him on it, he acts all confused, like  I'm the one with the problem."
Willow,(nods) His 'do I smell something?' look.
Cordelia,"All a part of his little guy games. It's like he's there, but  then he's not there, and he wants it, but then he doesn't want it."
Willow,"He's so busy looking around at everything he doesn't have, he  doesn't even realize what he *does* have."
Cordelia,"Well, he should at least realize that you have Oz."
Willow,"(frowns and raises an eyebrow) Mm, I'm not sure I do.  (confused) Oz and I are in some sort of holding pattern, except without  the holding or... anything else."
Cordelia,"What's he waiting for? What's his problem? (rolls her eyes)  Oh, that's right, he's a guy."
Willow,"(disgusted) Yeah, him and Xander. Guys."
Cordelia,Who do they think they are?
Willow,A couple of guys.
Giles,Looks as though your hunch was right.
Buffy,Who could resist Sunnydale's own house of hormones?
Willow,"The werewolf, it's in there."
Buffy,Coming through!
Cain,You let it get away.
Buffy,I didn't let it do anything. I had the chain around its neck.
Cain,"Chain? What were you gonna do, take it for a walk?"
Buffy,I was going to lock it up.
Cain,That's beautiful. (approaches her) This is what happens when a  woman tries to do a man's job.
Giles,"Now, you look here, Mr. Cain. This girl risked her life trying  to capture a beast that you haven't as yet been able to find. (takes his  bag off of his shoulder)"
Cain,Uh-huh. And Daddy's doing a great job carrying her bag of milk  bones.
Cain,"You know, sis, if that thing out there harms anyone, it's going  to be on your pretty little head. I hope you can live with that."
Buffy,(stares him down) I live with that every day.
Cain,(shakes his head) First they tell me I can't hunt an elephant for  its ivory... (turns and leaves) Now I've gotta deal with People for the  Ethical Treatment of Werewolves.
Giles,"(under his breath) Pillock! Right, let's move out."
Buffy,Giles?
Buffy,Giles!
Giles,Uhh! (takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes)
Buffy,I didn't see you there. I thought something had happened.
Giles,"Oh, no, I'm, uh..."
Giles,"(yawns) I'm okay. I'm just, um, fine... uh, just, uh, I'm,  uh.... Uh, any sign of the, uh, werewolf? (puts his glasses back on)"
Buffy,No. I'm guessing you didn't see anything either from that  vantage point of having your eyes closed.
Giles,"It's, uh, it's, it's, uh, gonna be light soon, so we'd better..."
Buffy,Wait.
Giles,"Buffy, we're gonna get this thing. We have another whole night.  (Buffy looks at him) There's nothing more we can do now. It's nearly  sunrise. That werewolf won't be a werewolf much longer."
Oz,(confused) Huh.
Oz,"Aunt Maureen. Hey, it's me. Um, what? Oh! It's, uh... actually it's  healing okay. That's pretty much the reason I called. Um, I wanted to  ask you something. Is Jordy a werewolf? Uh-huh. And how long has that  been going on? Uh-huh. What? No, no reason. Um... Thanks. Yeah, love to  Uncle Ken."
Buffy,I can't believe I let that thing get away. Cain was right. I  shoulda killed it when I had the chance.
Oz,Killed what?
Buffy,"Uh, the, uh, (ahem) the werewolf. It-it-it was out last night."
Oz,"Is everybody okay? Did anyone get bitten or, or scratched?"
Willow,"No, we're fine."
Oz,Gladness.
Buffy,"Yeah, but he got someone. Theresa."
Oz,"'Got', as in..."
Oz,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Buffy,And I coulda stopped it. (sits)
Giles,"Well, we, we have one more night."
Oz,Another night?
Buffy,"Oh, yeah. Believe me, I'm gonna give that wolfie something to  howl about."
Oz,Hmm.
Xander,"(comes over) But while we hang here doing nothing, there's a  human werewolf walking around out there, probably making fun of us."
Willow,(with a hint of sarcasm) The way werewolves always do.
Oz,But there's really no way to tell who it is.
Xander,"Oh, sure there is. Giles knows stuff, and I'm practically an  expert on the subject."
Willow,On account of once you were a hyena?
Xander,"I know what it's like to crave the taste of freshly killed  meat, to be taken over by those uncontrollable urges."
Buffy,You said you didn't remember anything about that.
Xander,"(chuckles) I said I didn't remember anything about that. Look,  the point is, is I have an affinity with this thing. I can get inside of  its head. (closes his eyes and begins to *be* the werewolf) I'm a big,  bad wolf. I'm on the prowl. (sniffs) I'm sniffing, I'm snarling, I'm a  slobbering predator, I'm... (opens his eyes) Wait a second! It's right  in front of us. (Oz's eye go wide with the fear of being recognized)  It's obvious who I am. I'm Larry! (Oz breathes a sigh of relief) The  guy's practically got wolf-boy stamped on his forehead. You got the dog  bite, you got the aggression, not to mention the excessive back hair."
Buffy,And he was awfully gleeful about tormenting Theresa.
Giles,"Still, that doesn't necessarily mean that..."
Xander,I'm gonna go talk to him. Gonna force a confession out of him.  (leaves)
Giles,"Good. Go. Uh, in the meantime, we need to cover our bases.  Willow, um, check the student files. See if anybody else fits the  profile. Uh, Buffy?"
Buffy,Where are we going?
Giles,"I-if none of that works, I think I may have an alternative.  (goes into his office)"
Buffy,"Yeah, me and the werewolf alone in a cage for three minutes.  That's all I ask. (gets up and follows Giles)"
Willow,(to Oz) Are you okay?
Oz,(comes back to earth) What?
Willow,You kind of knew Theresa.
Oz,"Oh, yeah, I, uh, I'm trying not to think about it. It's... it's a  lot."
Willow,It is. But we can do stuff to help. Sometimes it feels good to  help.
Oz,Uh-huh.
Willow,"Well, like... looking up stuff. I'm gonna be doing that most of  the night. You could help me, help together?"
Oz,"(unsure what to do) I can't. Um, uh, I'm busy."
Willow,Oh. So...
Oz,I... I gotta go.
Larry,Harris. Sheesh. Next time wear a bell. (opens his locker)
Xander,"Why so jumpy, Larry?"
Larry,Geeks make me nervous.
Xander,Is that really it or is there something you're hiding?
Larry,(leans on his locker door) I could hide my fist in your face.
Xander,"I know your secret, big guy. I know what you've been doing at  night."
Larry,"You know, Harris, that nosey little nose of yours is going to  get you into trouble someday... (grabs Xander by the shirt) Like today."
Xander,Hurting me isn't gonna make this go away. People are still  gonna find out.
Larry,(lets go) Alright. What do you want? Hush money? Is that what  you're after?
Xander,I don't *want* anything! I just wanna help!
Larry,"What, you think you have a cure?"
Xander,"No, it's just... I know what you're going through because I've  been there. That's why I know you should talk about it."
Larry,"Yeah, that's easy for *you* to say. I mean, you're nobody. I've  got a reputation here."
Xander,"Larry, please, before someone else gets hurt."
Larry,"(points at Xander's chest) Look, if this gets out, it's over for  me. (turns and takes a few paces away) I mean, forget about playing  football. They'll run me outta this town. I mean, come on! How are  people going to look at me (faces Xander) after they find out I'm gay."
Larry,"Oh, wow. I said it. And it felt... okay. (whispers) I'm gay.  (approaches Xander) I am gay."
Xander,I heard you the first time.
Larry,"I can't believe it. It was almost easy. I never felt I could  tell anyone. (gestures to Xander) And then you, you of all people, you  bring it outta me."
Xander,It probably would have slipped out even if I wasn't here.
Larry,"(leans on his locker door) No, no, because knowing you went  through the same thing, made it easier for me to admit it."
Xander,(wide-eyed) The same thing...
Larry,"(puts his arm around Xander) It's ironic. I mean, all those  times I beat the crap out of you, it musta been because I recognized  something in you that I didn't want to believe about myself."
Xander,"(laughs nervously) Larry, no, I am not..."
Larry,"Of course, of course not. Don't worry. (pats Xander on the  shoulder) I wouldn't do that to you. Your secret's safe with me."
Larry,(to himself) Wow.
Buffy,So what's the scuttlebutt? Anybody besides Larry fit our  werewolf profile? (sits on the table)
Willow,"There is one name that keeps getting spit out. Aggressive  behavior, run-ins with authorities, about a screenful of violent  incidents."
Buffy,"Okay, most of those were not my fault. Somebody else started  'em. I was just standing up for myself."
Willow,(looks up at Buffy) They say it's a good idea to count to ten  when you're angry.
Buffy,One... Two... Three...
Willow,(looks back at her laptop) I'll keep looking. (goes back to  work)
Buffy,"I, um... noticed you were looking solo."
Willow,Yeah. Oz wanted to be someplace that was (looks up at Buffy)  away... from me.
Buffy,I'm sorry.
Willow,"(leans back in her chair) I can't figure him out. I mean, he's  so hot and cold. Or luke-warm and cold."
Buffy,"Welcome to the mystery that is men. I think it goes something  like, they grow body hair, they lose all ability to tell you what they  really want."
Willow,It doesn't seem like a fair trade. (stands up and puts her  laptop in its case)
Buffy,"Well, if you wanna up the speed quotient with Oz, maybe you need  to do something daring. Maybe you need to make the first move."
Willow,"Well, that won't make me a slut?"
Buffy,I think your reputation will remain intact.
Willow,It used to be so much easier to tell if a boy liked you. He'd  punch you on the arm and then run back to his friends.
Buffy,Those were the days.
Xander,(comes up to them) Hey.
Willow,I'll see you guys later. (Buffy looks at her) Cordelia asked me  to look over her history homework before class. I think that means I  might have to *do* it. (goes off)
Xander,"Wow, those two gals are hanging out a lot together. This would  be a good time to panic."
Buffy,So how'd it go with Larry?
Xander,What's that supposed to mean?
Buffy,"I think it's supposed to mean, 'so how'd it go with Larry'?"
Xander,He's not the werewolf. Can't we just leave it at that? Must you  continue to *push* and *push*?
Buffy,(opens her locker) I'm sorry. I was just wondering. (takes off  her pack)
Xander,"Well, he's not."
Buffy,Okay.
Xander,Okay.
Buffy,But there goes our lead suspect. (sticks her pack in her locker)  Which then puts us right back at (closes the locker) square boned.
Xander,"You're not boned, you're Buffy. Eradicator of evil. Defender  of, um... things that need defending."
Buffy,Tell that to Theresa. She could have used my defending before  she was ripped apart by that... (stops and considers)
Xander,Werewolf.
Buffy,"Nowhere in any of the reports did it say anything about her  being mauled. (looks up at Xander) I mean, they were linked to the  animal attacks from the other night, so we just assumed werewolf."
Xander,What else should we have assumed?
Buffy,Vampire.
Xander,"So that's good, right? I mean in the sense of the werewolf  didn't get her, and... (gets a look from Buffy) No. There is no good  here."
Buffy,"No good. Instead of not protecting Theresa from the werewolf,  (goes over to the guest register) I was able to not protect her from  something just as bad. (looks at all the signatures) She had a lot of  friends. (takes the pen to add her own)"
Xander,"Buffy, you can't blame yourself for every death that happens in  Sunnydale. If it weren't for you people'd be lined up five deep waitin'  to get themselves buried. Willow would be Robbie the Robot's love slave,  I wouldn't even have a head, (looks at the coffin) and Theresa's a  vampire."
Theresa,Angel sends his love.
Buffy,(to herself) Angel. (gets to her knees)
Xander,(leans down to her) Are you okay?
Buffy,(takes his hand) This isn't happening. (pulls herself up and  hugs Xander) He's gonna keep coming after me.
Xander,(hugs back gently) Don't let him get to you. He's not the same  guy you knew.
Xander,"Oh, no, my life's not too complicated."
Oz,Willow! What are you doing?
Willow,"I had this whole thing worked out. (goes toward the dining  room) And I had it written down, uh, but then it didn't make any sense  (turns to face him) when I was reading it back."
Oz,"Willow, this is not a very good time."
Willow,"I mean, what am I supposed to think? First, you buy me popcorn  (paces away) and then you're all glad that I didn't get bit. (paces  back) (softly) And you put the tag back in my shirt. (harshly) But I  guess none of that means anything because instead of looking up names  with me, here you are all alone in your house doing nothing by yourself."
Oz,"Willow, we'll talk about this tomorrow. I promise."
Willow,"No, damn it! We'll talk about this now! Buffy told me that  sometimes what a girl makes has to be the first move and now that I'm  saying this, I'm starting to think that the written version sounded  pretty good, but you know what I mean."
Oz,"I know, I know, it's me. I'm, I'm goin' through some... changes."
Willow,"Well, welcome to the world! Things happen. Don't you think I'm  going through a lot?"
Oz,Not like me.
Willow,"Oh, what, so now you're special? (paces away into the dining  room) You're special boy... (sees the shackles) With chains and stuff.  Why do you have chains and stuff?"
Oz,"Willow, please! (heads for the door) Get outta here!"
Willow,"Oz? Oz, what is it?"
Willow,What's wrong?
Cain,There you are.
Buffy,Sorry I'm late. I had to do some unscheduled slayage in the form  of Theresa.
Giles,She's a vampire?
Buffy,Was. Angel sent her to me. A little token of his affection.
Giles,"Buffy, I'm so sorry."
Buffy,"(holds up her hand) Not now, Giles. We can all have ourselves a  good cry after we bag us a werewolf."
Giles,All set. (grabs a dart) Let's go find this thing. (starts out)
Buffy,One question: how exactly do we find this thing?
Willow,It's Oz! It's Oz!
Buffy,Wh-what's Oz?
Willow,The werewolf.
Giles,Are you certain?
Willow,(frantic) Can't you just trust me on this? He-he said he was  going through all these changes. Then he went through all these...  changes.
Buffy,Where is he now?
Willow,In the woods.
Giles,Let's go. (starts out again)
Willow,"(grabs and stops him) Go where? You're not gonna kill Oz! Yeah,  he's a werewolf, but he doesn't mean to be."
Buffy,"Don't worry, Willow. We're not going to hurt him."
Giles,I put enough Phenobarbital in this thing to sink a small  elephant. It should be enough for a large werewolf.
Cain,"That's it. Let me see you. Come on, suppertime."
Cain,"Good, doggy. Now play dead."
Willow,Careful!
Giles,(can't get a shot) Damn it!
Willow,(looks up at Giles) I shot Oz.
Giles,You saved us.
Cain,No wonder this town's overrun with monsters. No one here's man  enough to kill 'em.
Buffy,"Oh, I wouldn't be too sure of that."
Buffy,How about you let the door hit you in the ass on the way out of  town?
Willow,You think it'll be okay?
Giles,"He'll be a little sore in the morning, but... he'll be Oz."
Xander,"This is all so weird. I mean, how are we supposed to act when  we see him?"
Buffy,"Well, it's gotta be weird for him, too. Now that we know so  much."
Xander,All I know is I'll never be able to look at him the same again.
Buffy,He's still a human being. Most of the time.
Xander,Who are we talking about?
Buffy,Oz. Who are you talking about?
Xander,No one.
Larry,"Hey, let me get those."
Girl,Thanks.
Larry,"Hey! Xander. Look, about what you did. I, I owe you."
Buffy,What'd you do?
Xander,It's really nothing we should be talking about. (to Larry)  Ever.
Larry,"I know, I know. It's just, well, (pats him on the arm) thanks.  (walks off)"
Buffy,That was weird.
Xander,"What, it's not okay for one guy to like another guy just  because he happened to be in the locker room with him when absolutely  nothing happened and I thought I told you not to push."
Buffy,All I meant is that he didn't try to look up my skirt.
Xander,"(fidgets with is hands) Oh, oh, yeah, that's, that's the  weirdness. (smiles nervously)"
Buffy,Weirdness abounds lately. Maybe it's the moon. That does stuff  to people.
Xander,I've heard that.
Buffy,(sees Willow walk by) Certainly gonna put a strain on Willow and  Oz's relationship.
Xander,"What relationship? I mean, what life could they possibly have  together? (counts off on his fingers) We're talking obedience school,  paper training, Oz is always in back burying their things, and that kind  of breed can turn on its owner."
Buffy,I don't know. I kinda see Oz as the loyal type.
Xander,All I'm saying is she's not safe with him. If it were up to  me...
Buffy,(interrupts) Xander...
Buffy,It's not up to you.
Willow,Hey.
Oz,Hey.
Willow,Did you want to go first?
Oz,I spoke to Giles. He said I'll be okay. I just have to lock myself  up around the full moon. Only he used more words than that. And a globe.
Willow,I'm sorry about how all this ended up. With me shooting you and  all.
Oz,"It's okay. I'm, I'm sorry I almost ate you."
Willow,It's okay. I kind of thought you would have told me.
Oz,"I didn't know what to say. I mean, it's not everyday you find out  you're a werewolf. That's fairly freaksome. It may take a couple days  getting used to."
Willow,Yeah. It's a complication.
Oz,So... (hops off of the table and they walk) Maybe it'd be best if I  just... sorta...
Willow,What?
Oz,"Well, you know, like, stayed out of your way for awhile."
Willow,I don't know. I'm kind of okay with you being *in* my way.
Oz,"(stops and faces her) You mean, you'd still..."
Willow,"Well, I like you. You're nice and you're funny. And you don't  smoke. Yeah, okay, werewolf, but that's not all the time. I mean, three  days out of the month I'm not much fun to be around either."
Oz,You are quite the human.
Willow,"(smiles) So, I'd still if you'd still."
Oz,I'd still. I'd *very* still.
Willow,"(smiles widely) Okay. (more seriously) No biting, though."
Oz,Agreed.
Oz,A werewolf in love.
