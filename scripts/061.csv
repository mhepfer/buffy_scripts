Parker,Buffy?
Buffy,Parker? Stay down.
Parker,Buffy!!!
Parker,"Buffy, I don't know what to say. After the way I've treated you, and now I owe you my life"
Buffy,It's nothing.
Parker,It's everything. You're everything. And I'm going to do whatever it takes to get you to forgive me. Do you think one day you might .
Parker,"Buffy, I don't know what to say. After the way I've treated you, and now I owe you my life."
Parker,Can you ever forgive me?
Xander,Rough day? Come on Buff. Be a lonely drunk. Rough day?
Buffy,Stop flicking at me.
Xander,"Work with me here. I'm finally an essential part of your collegy life. No more looking down o n the townie. I'm the new bartender over at the pub. Got my lighter, my rag, my empathy face"
Willow,aren't you two young to be a bartender?
Xander,"Oh contraire, mon frere."
Buffy,mon frere means brother
Xander,mon girlfrere. Behold (holds up a fake id) Behold.
Willow,I don't believe this is entirely on the up and up.
Xander,What gives it away?
Willow,looking at it.
Xander,Well no one's going to see it anyway. Now I'm the bartender. I kick people out
Buffy,You know there's more to it than wiping and kicking. Mixing drinks for instance.
Xander,"Well, I've seen cocktail. I can do the hippy-hippy shake."
Buffy,"Well, even if I've had a pretend cigarette I couldn't tell you my pretend problems. The real ones have clogged up my headspace."
Xander,ooh unload em right here baby. Rough day? You wanna talk about it? Shutting up now.
Willow,I'm pregnant by my stepbrother who'd rather be with my best friend whose left me with no place to live. No food except this bottle of wild turkey which I drank all up.
Willow,That was me being tanked and friendless for ya.
Xander,Gets my Oscar nod
Buffy,You know what? It's classtime.
Xander,So are you going to come by tonight to the pub?
Willow,Oz. Bronze. Date.
Buffy,"You know maybe, maybe he's just having trouble dealing. I mean, don't guys sometimes put the girl they really, really like inside these deep little brain fantasy bubbles where everything's perfect?  They do that right?"
Xander,How's that fugue state coming along
Willow,Parker.
Buffy,Maybe I'm in his bubble and then pretty soon he's going to realize that he wants more than just bubble Buffy and he'll pop me out and we'll go to dinner and it could happen right?
Willow,"Buffy. And as my best friend you need to stop thinking about Parker. He's no good. There are men, better men, wherein the mind is stronger than the penis."
Xander,"Nothing can defeat the penis! Too loud, very unseemly."
Willow,"I mean, I'm sorry do be so course but I feel strongly about stinky Parker man"
Buffy,He can be really sweet. I'm telling you I think he had intimacy problems because of the death of his father.
Willow,"Not interested. You got troubles, tell em to the bartender."
Xander,That's right. Cause the bartender's always ready to listen.
Xander,"What? What? Okay and you had a rum and coke, and you had a poker's light. And a vodka on the rocks. And a water. Is that right?"
Xander,"Ice water, right. Do you want that on the rocks?"
Buffy,"Oooh. Riley, I'm so sorry."
Riley,"That's okay you know, but most people go around.  I'm not saying you can't go through me, It's just that the other is much quicker."
Buffy,In my defense you do take up a lot of space.
Riley,I do. I'm (??). You looking for someone?
Buffy,"Um, I just saw Parker over there."
Riley,right. Parker and his latest conquest. You know that boy should have (??)
Buffy,he's kinda a girl chaser huh?
Riley,sets em up and knock's em down. I guess maybe I'm old fashioned but my father says that if you wanna be a gentleman you
Riley,don't even care what my father says.
Buffy,I'm sorry what?
Riley,forget about it. You know I've got some people waiting. I'll see you in class right?
Xander,Rough Day?
Girl,"Nay, it's been super. We accepted Melody's pledge. And made her an official sister of Beta Delta Gamma. And our pins arrived today. I designed it myself."
Xander,You are so sharp.
Guy,Hey Paula. You keeping this fine bartender from his duty? A man's gotta make a living.
Xander,s'all right.
Guy,So the guys and I are about to celebrate
Xander,"Uh, I said it was all right. I'm due for a break."
Guy,"Oh, so what were you discussing. Maybe we could all join."
Paula,Be nice
Guy,What?
Xander,"ah, forget it."
Guy,"Oh, no I rudely interrupted and it sounds like the two of you were having quite the meeting of minds. Possibly debating the geopolitical ramifications of bioengineering. You got a take on that?"
Xander,I've got beer. You want some beer.
Guy,"Yeah, a pitcher of Black Frost. You see I think we have a perfect venue here for conducting a little sociometry. A bi-polar continuum of attraction and rejection. No given your sociological statuses. I foresee a B rejects A dyad. I'm sorry, lemme clarify. You see, we are the future of this country and you keep our bowl of peanuts full. We are what these girls want. And uh, four glasses."
Xander,How's about I see some ID cause you're not seeing a drop until I'm satisfied that
Bartender,Just give em a beer
Xander,Buffy? Rough day? Wanna tell me about it?
Buffy,It's just . Parker's problem with intimacy turns out to be that he can't get enough of it. And knew it. I knew what he was. If he were tied and gagged and left in a cave that vampires happen to frequent it wouldn't really be like I killed him really
Xander,Buffy
Buffy,I'm a slut
Xander,No
Buffy,Idiot
Xander,No. You gotta stop being so hard on.
Bartender,Hey
Xander,"Sorry, so sorry."
Buffy,I'm better. This has helped.
Xander,Do NOT go anywhere.
Buffy,"Oh, oh. I'm so sorry I just keep running into people today."
Oz,Hey. You got a table.
Willow,I had to kill a man.
Oz,"Well, it's a really good table"
Willow,I copied out my notes for Psyche since you were so elsewhere this morning.
Oz,Thanks
Willow,"It's really pretty simple stuff. You know, just what's the matter."
Oz,I dunno. I feel It's nothing.
Willow,We could go back to your place. I could make you soup.
Oz,No. That's okay I'm fine. Thanks.
Willow,Do you know her?
Oz,Veruca? No. I know their drummer. He's cool. I've never heard them play.
Guys,"Chug, chug, chug, chug"
Buffy,My mother always said that beer was evil
Buffy,I'm really not sure:
Buffy,You guys really like to hear yourselves speak don't ya
Buffy,"Well, I don't hate this for a start."
Willow,"My name's Veruca. I'm in a band. I'm Oz, I'm in a band too. Oh, and this is Willow. Oh, how fun and creepy. Groovy. Buff, have you heard of this Veruca chick? Dresses like Faith, voice like an albatross."
Buffy,(watching MTV) TV is a good thing. Bright colours. Music. Tiny little people.
Willow,What did you do with Buffy
Buffy,I'm suffering the afterness of a bad night of badness
Willow,You didn't. Not with Parker again.
Buffy,"No, with four really smart guys."
Willow,"Four? Oh. Ow. Oh Buffy, are you okay? Do you wanna talk about it?"
Buffy,I went to see Xander. Then I saw Parker. Then came beer.
Willow,And then group sex?
Buffy,(Hits her) Gutter face. No! Just lots and lots of beer. It's nice. Foamy. Comforting. It's just beer.
Willow,"Drowning your troubles over Parker. Mind frying man! He deserves a slow and torturous death by spiderbites. Well, for today we'll just have to throw spitballs at his neck in class."
Buffy,Okay. (Gets up to leave in her pjs)
Willow,Uh (stops her) getting dressed would be fun to.
Buffy,She read the reading.
Willow,Buffy!! Buffy are you okay?
Buffy,"This good. Ooh, good enough."
Buffy,yeah. Foamy.
Girl,"Boy, I'm having the worst day. You got a light?"
Buffy,You stupid
Buffy,smelly head
Oz,Willow. Hey. I tried calling
Willow,"Yeah, I've been up at the library. How are you feeling?"
Oz,What do you mean?
Willow,"well, you weren't in class. Again."
Oz,"Yeah, I was practicing. Hey Shy's playing again tonight"
Willow,Shy?
Oz,"yeah, Veruca's band and they asked me to sit in with them. It would be kinda cool if you were there."
Willow,Two Veruca shows in two nights. Are you sure you wanna share your groupie? I think I'm gonna study. Because of the fun.
Oz,"well, yeah I guess how I could see it be dull for ya."
Willow,See ya (she turns around and leaves)
Oz,Yeah. (He looks hurt and leaves)
Buffy,No you. (They all laugh)
Buffy,You (they all laugh)
Buffy,Hey! She runs over to him and looks confused. She bangs on the jukebox and laughs
Buffy,thing. Like it.
Xander,It's time to go home Buffy
Buffy,Want more singing. Want more beer
Xander,"No, I've cut you off."
Buffy,did it hurt
Xander,Out you go.
Buffy,"Ow, oh, want beer. Like beer. Beer good."
Xander,"Beer Bad. Bad, bad beer. What the hell am I saying? Buffy, go home and go to bed."
Buffy,Say bye (pushes him)
Xander,Bye
Buffy,Bye (she leaves)
Parker,Hey. Did you want something?
Willow,Yes. I wanted to give you a piece of my mind. I'm tired of you men and your manness. Buffy's really hurting right now. In fact she's in need of a big mental tidy. Parker how could you do this to her?
Parker,"Oh, I don't get what you mean. What did I do?"
Willow,She shared something very intimate with you. And you act like it's nothing more than a bag of some kind of snack food
Parker,"Willow, I'm not sure I need to explain my actions here but if that's what you want"
Willow,Yes followed by an admission of undeniable guilt. But go on. (She sits down with him)
Parker,some relationships center on a deep emotional tie. Or a loyal friendship. Or something. But most are just two people passing through life enriching or aggravating each other's lives briefly.
Willow,Go on
Parker,Just for one night can't two people who feel an attraction come together and create something wonderful? And then go back to their lives the next day better for it but never over analyzing it or wanting it to be more than it was? I have. She should too.
Willow,People like Buffy a-and me assume that intimacy means friendship and respect. People shouldn't have to ask first if you're going to be eyeing other prospects tomorrow.
Parker,People shouldn't have to preface casual sex with just so you know I'll never grow any older with you. It takes the fire out of it.
Willow,Maybe.
Parker,"Willow, I don't regret what happened. Or what we did. But I am sorry that Buffy's hurting and if I mislead her than I'm sorry for that too I didn't mean to. I'm impressed that you care so much about her. You're a good friend."
Xander,"Alright, time to pay up and go home guys."
Xander,"Let's see, I'll take this one, and this one. And you know I've always had a problem calculating the tip and you guys being so dapper and brain, maybe you can help me out. Okay great. See if your bill comes to thirty-eight dollars and people tip what, approximately thirty percent? That makes you tip what? (One of the guys gives him all the money). You are so smart. This is so the right amount. (Hears banging in the bathroom). Somebody didn't have their fiber today. Hey are you alright in there? Buddy?"
Xander,"(jumping up): Hey, hey, easy. We're cool. (They back him into a corner) Help. Oh God. (He pulls out his Zippo lighter and lights it. The Neanderthals are all afraid of the fire and back away)"
Xander,Fire angry! (They all run away out the door in fear. Xander closes the door behind them and calls his boss)
Xander,Jack! Jack! We've got a problem. The guys they they're some of the patrons are turning into cavemen
Jack,They've had it comin (he puts some Black Frost beer on the counter)
Jack,"you know I've been taking abuse from snot nosed kids for twenty years. They're always coming in here with their snotty attitude, drinking their fruity little micro brews and spouting out some philosophy Like it means a damn thing. Thinking they're different than us.  Xander: They are now"
Jack,they ain't. That's the great thing about beer. It makes all men the same.
Xander,Why are we talking about beer the guys are the beer.
Jack,Neat huh? My brother-in-law's a warlock. He showed me how to do it.
Xander,"No. No neat. I served them that beer. I served Buffy that beer! Uh, how much beer would you say a person would need to consume before they start seriously questing for fire?"
Jack,Relax. It will wear off in a day or so.
Xander,"In a day or so someone is going to get killed. You're a bad, bad man."
Xander,"Well, I cut her off before the others so I don't think she had as much to drink."
Giles,I can't believe you served Buffy that beer.
Xander,I didn't know it was evil
Giles,But you knew it was beer
Xander,well excuse Mr. I spent the sixties in an electric Kool-Aid funky Satan groove.
Giles,it was the early seventies and you should know better
Xander,I'm not the dad of her. Buffy's a grown up. It wasn't enough to
Buffy,Parker bad
Parker,I don't mean this in a bragging way but I do get to know a lot of women
Willow,"Well, getting to know people is good."
Parker,"But I haven't found the one yet. I've yet to find the girl that I can just sit with. Feel totally at ease. Feeling whatever's on my mind. Or even sit with comfortably in silence. Willow, can I tell you something kinda private?"
Willow,"okay, I mean I feel you've shown me a perspective I haven't really thought much about before. What was it you wanted to tell me?"
Parker,Just that I've enjoyed talking to you. Here. Tonight.
Willow,"Me too. I mean, with you. You know, I'm wondering something. About you."
Parker,What?
Willow,Just how gullible do you think I am? I mean with you gentle eyes and your shy smile and your ability to talk openly even to me!  You're unbelievable!
Parker,What?
Willow,This isn't sharing. This isn't connecting. It's the pleasure principle. That's right I got your number ID boy. The only thing you're thinking about is how long you can jump on my bones
Parker,"Look, if you think that I'm"
Willow,"I mean, you men. It's all about the sex! You find a woman, drag her to your den, do whatever's necessary just as long as you get the sex. I tell you men haven't changed since the dawn of time."
Willow,You see?
Giles,fascinating really.
Buffy,Want people. Where people go?
Giles,The TV is off.
Buffy,Want! Want people.
Giles,She doesn't appear to be in any danger. Maybe you should stay with her.
Giles,or perhaps she should be left alone.
Buffy,Boy smells nice (she grabs him and snifs him)
Xander,"Yeah, I think we need to track down the fun boys somewhat pronto. Jack said the effects of the beer would wear off"
Buffy,Beer? Buffy want beer
Giles,You can't have beer
Buffy,Want beer
Xander,"Giles, don't make cave slayer unhappy"
Buffy,Buffy strong
Giles,"Yes, Buffy strong"
Buffy,Buffy get beer
Giles,Buffy get
Xander,Giles!
Giles,I'm fine. Just get her
Xander,Which way?
Giles,"Um, check down there. We have to find her before someone gets hurt."
Xander,Buffy! Buffy!
Xander,Aha can't find the beer. Good. Freshman girls unable to hold the beer shouldn't have it. Get into trouble.
Xander,"Hey, we're good. Remember the boy? Boy smells good yeah? Is there any part of Buffy still in there."
Xander,Oh no.
Buffy,Fire bad!
Xander,Buffy?!
Xander,Where the hell is Giles?
Giles,"Blonde. Um, about this tall. Walks with a sort of a sideways limp."
Buffy,Bad. Bad.
Xander,Are you alright?
Willow,Buffy's still in there.
Parker,"Oh God. Help me. I can't breathe. (He sees her). Buffy. Oh god, what do we do?"
Xander,Did you guys have enough fun for one night?
Willow,Yes. Please.
Buffy,Buffy tired.
Xander,And was there a lesson in all this huh? What did we learn about beer?
Buffy,Foamy
Xander,"Good, just as long as that's clear. Anyways I think that the boys in the car are contained for the time being. This will give them some time to ponder the geo-political ramifications of BEING MEAN TO ME!"
Giles,whose van is that?
Xander,I dunno. Wasn't locked.
Parker,"Buffy. Buffy I I dunno how to say this. I'm sorry for how I treated you before. It was wrong of me and I'm sorry. You were great tonight, really. I might not deserve this but do you think that you could forgive me?"
