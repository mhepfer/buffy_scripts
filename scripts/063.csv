Riley,"No. I'm with this large pile of ungraded papers, due at 3:00."
Riley,(Looks up.) She's buffy.
Forrest,"Buffy? I like that. That girl's so hot, she's buffy."
Riley,"It's her name, Forrest."
Forrest,You've established first contact? Excellent. What do you think of her?
Riely,I haven't really thought about what I think of her.
Forrest,"A girl that cute in the face, and you form no opinion?"
Riley,"No, I mean, She's all right, I guess. She's just kind of... I don't know."
Forrest,"Peculiar? Hi. Hey, graham, what do you think of the blonde chick?"
Forrest,I bet you do.
Graham,Maybe she's canadian.
Forrest,Didn't she go out with parker abrams for about 30 seconds?
Riley,"Abrams? Yeah, there's a sign of good taste."
Forrest,"Ok, but you've got to admit she's a major league hottie."
Riley,"Well, I'm not denying she's easy on the eyes."
Forrest,"Hell, yes. I bet a lot of guys would like to get their hands on her."
Spike,Slayer... I'll kill you. Not so tough. I... Kill slayer.
Giles,"Well, based on buffy's description, I believe the men that we're after"
Giles,"Oh, I think we can safely assume they're human, So, um, no research needed."
Xander,Really?
Giles,Really.
Xander,"Well, how about this? We whip out the ouija board, light a few candles,"
Giles,Wee bit unethical.
Giles,"It's--it's just for reference, you know, But fairly accurate you'd say?"
Buffy,That's your man.
Giles,"Your man, actually. Uh...You are patrolling tonight?"
Giles,"Look, buffy, somebody's got to find out who these people are."
Buiffy,"Giles, I live in a dorm now. The girls in my hall want to party,"
Xander,How's will dealing--
Vampire,Don't drink it. It's drugged.
Spike,"(He throws down the pack, frusterated.) Uh-huh. And who are you, mate?"
Spike,And how are they gonna do that?
Spike,"And, uh, they are? The government? Nazis? A major cosmetics company?"
Vampire,"Who cares? All I know is, one minute I'm running from the slayer,"
Spike,The slayer! I knew it! I knew it!
Vamire,"Yeah, she took apart my crew, and led me straight to these guys."
Spike,"She set me up, too. I always worried what would happen"
Buffy,Stupid pen. (She looks down alarmed.) My notes!
Wilow,Ballpoints can be tricky.
Walsh,I'll see you all tomorrow.
Riley,He's not in this class anymore. I hear he dropped out.
Willow,"Oh, but--"
Buffy,"You know, for someone who teaches human behavior, you might try showing some."
Walsh,It's not my job to coddle my students.
Walsh,I like her.
Rirley,Really? You don't think she's a little peculiar?
Giles,That's a very impressive array. Where'd it all come from?
Xander,"Uh, requisitioned it. Back when I was a military guy."
Giles,That was 2 years ago. You still 100%?
Giles,"Well, I'm sure you'll be ready when the time comes."
Xander,"Yes, mom!"
Giles,"(Looks up.) Is it, uh, raspberry fruit punch?"
Forrest,"Oh, you're lying. She says that to Walsh?"
Riley,Hope to die.
Forrest,Doesn't lack for guts. You've got to give her that.
Riley,"Yeah, but she's nuts."
Forrest,"Oh, come on. Like you never wanted to tell the professor off? Hey, Parker!"
Parker,"Forrest. What's up, man?"
Forrest,What's the scoop on Buffy Summers? Is she cool?
Parker,"Buffy? Yeah, she's all right, I guess. I mean, kind of whiney."
Forrest,How's that?
Forrest,"No, but fun was had, yeah?"
Riley,(Walking between Forrest and Graham.) I can't believe that I did that.
Forrest,Welcome to the club. Do you have any idea how much trouble
Graham,"He won't, he's too embarrassed."
Riley,I hit him.
Forrest,What the hell for?
Riley,He--he was just being so crude.
Forrest,Please. You've heard me say much grosser things than that.
Forrest,What is it?
Forrest,You're kind of like a moron.
Riley,"So, you... You knew that I had feelings for her."
Forrest,"Everybody knows, man. Oh, she's peculiar? Dead giveaway, buddy."
Riley,I'm always the last to know.
Forrest,"So, whatcha gonna do?"
Riley,"(Walking off.) Well, I guess I'm gonna go see a girl."
Spike,"Sorry, can't stay. Got to go see a girl."
Vampire,Let me out!
Spike,Bit busy right now.
Vampire,Hurry! Hurry!
Vampire,This way!
Willow,"Come in. (RIely walks in.) Oh, Riley. Hi."
Riley,"Hi. Gee, I hope I'm not interrupting anything really depressing."
Willow,What's up?
Riley,"(Looking nervous.) Right to the point, ok. I was thinking of asking out Buffy."
Willow,She's not here.
Willow,"Ok, say that I help, and you start a conversation. It goes great."
Riley,"(Looking a bit put out, but is glib.) Yep, that's the plan."
Willow,I figured it was.
Willow,Why should I trust you?
Riley,Just sort of hoping you'd think I have an honest face.
Willow,I've seen host faces before. They usually come attached to liars.
Willow,She likes cheese.
Riley,That's a start.
Willow,"Well, it'll give you a chance to interact, but don't get fresh."
Willow,Sorry.
Willow,I'm not your accomplice.
Riley,"No, no. Of course not."
Willow,I'm not.
Riley,You're not.
Willow,We're clear.
Riley,We're clear.
Harmony,"Spike? Spike, is that really you? (He walks up to her.)"
Spike,"It's me, baby."
Harmony,Bastard. You dumped me and staked me and hurt me and left me--
Spike,"Oh, never, my little foam latte. Your blondie bear is here to stay."
Harmony,Ooh. Italian.
Spike,"Ow! Uh, no, see, ow. (Harmony is grabbings his hair, getting cute.)"
Xander,Every man faces this moment. Here. Now. Watching. Waiting
Giles,"Oh, shut up."
Buffy,Looks cool.
Willow,Uh-huh.
Buffy,"Look, we could go."
Willow,"No-no, we're here for fun."
Buffy,"Oh, look. Some of the guys are here already."
Willow,I'm gonna grab a soda. I'll--I'll find you guys.
Buffy,Ok.
Riley,So what do I do?
Willow,Ask her to dance.
Riley,Right. Dance. Wait. No.
Willow,What's the matter? (She turns to face him.)
Riley,I can't dance.
Riely,Excuse me. Hi.
Buffy,Hi.
Riley,Um...Buffy... (He pauses looking at a loss.) You do the reading on chapter 9?
Buffy,Uh-huh. (She gives him a look.)
Riley,"Wow. Some theories, huh? Cheese? (He holds up a cube of cheese on a stick.)"
Xander,Harmony.
Harmony,Xander? (She walks towards him.)
Harmony,I can kill you where you stand.
Xander,"Bring it on, then."
Xander,Ow!
Harmony,Ow! You sissy kicker!
Xander,Get away! Aah! Cut it out!
Harmony,"Ow, I'm so gonna bite you!"
Xander,"Ow... Ok, stop, stop! We should stop, ok?"
Harmony,"Ok, I will if you will."
Xander,Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 1...2...3!
Harmony,"Right, ok."
Xander,Spike?
Riley,I can't believe it. I choked.
Willow,"You really, really did."
Willow,"Well, you failed extremely well."
Riley,That's a great comfort to me.
Riley,Are you ok?
Willow,This song...
Riley,"Oh, yeah, it's a tape of some bands from last year's party. Associations?"
Willow,Big.
Willow,Thank you. Now go find Buffy.
Riley,"There's no hurry. I mean, if you want to talk."
Riley,Thanks.
Buffy,Hey.
Buffy,Thank you.
Riley,You know... I wanted to ask you something.
Buffy,Ask away.
Buffy,"Business? Right. Uh, excuse us?"
Riley,No problem.
Forrest,Denied.
Riley,"It's not like she blew me off. She just left with another guy, that's all."
Riley,Is that necessary?
Computer,Retinal scan accepted.
Riley,I like her.
Graham,"I'm on your side, here."
Forrest,"Dude, straight tip: I know girls."
Graham,Maybe a peculiar one.
Walsh,"Gentlemen, suit up. We have a code red. Hostile 17 has escaped."
Forrest,That's a big head start.
Riely,Nobody's failin' on my watch.
Buffy,What is wrong with him? Doesn't spike get that this is my town?
Giles,He's resilient.
Buffy,And it's my night off.
Buffy,What is that supposed to mean?
Xander,Nothing.
Buffy,Riley's a doof. He's not teutonic.
Giles,"We have to assume that Spike's main target is you, Buffy."
Buffy,"Fine. You know what? He's worn out his welcome. Tonight, I kill him."
Giles,You have a plan?
Buffy,"I am the plan. If spike wants me, I go alone... No arguments."
Xander,"Oh, wait, wait! Take this."
Xander,You get into trouble...
Buffy,Ok. I'll flare.
Xander,And we'll come a-runnin'. (Buffy leaves.) Do you think Spike'll find her?
Giles,I'm sure of it.
Spike,"Hello, gorgeous."
Riley,What've we got?
Graham,"Civilian, sir."
Riley,"Ah, damn."
Forrest,"She's compromising the area. At least she's not making crazy, naked sex."
Riely,Told you. We gotta clear her outta there... Fast.
Riley,You wanna use the girl I got a crush on as bait?
Forrest,I can tag a hostile at 50 yards.
Riley,Denied.
Forrest,She'd be safe the entire--
Riley,"I said denied, agent."
Forrest,Did you just pull rank on me?
Riley,Do you have a problem with that?
Forrest,"No, sir. So, how're we gonna get her out of there?"
Buffy,Riley! What are you doing here?
Riley,Why?
Buffy,I need space.
Riley,We're outdoors.
Buffy,Whoa! Ok... It's a free campus. Who died and made you John Wayne?
Riley,I'm just trying to help.
Riley,Are you drunk?
Buffy,Yes! Go and report me.
Riley,I'm taking you home. Come on.
Riley,Yeah.
Buffy,That is so teutonic.
Riley,"Look, Buffy, as long as you're out here, I'm staying."
Buffy,"Well, as long as you're out here, I'm staying."
Riley,Gotta go.
Buffy,See ya!
Riley,Tell me we're tracking.
Graham,Honing a signal. Got it... Heading west. Better be the hostile.
Willow,I--I'll scream.
Spike,Bonus.
Willow,No!
Willow,Maybe you were nervous.
Willow,Maybe you're trying too hard. Doesn't this happen to every vampire?
Spike,"Not to me, it doesn't!"
Willow,"It's me, isn't it?"
Spike,What are you talking about?
Spike,Piffle!
Spike,Don't be ridiculous. I'd bite you in a heartbeat.
Willow,Really?
Spike,Thought about it.
Willow,When?
Willow,I never would have guessed. You played the blood-lust kinda cool.
Willow,But if you could...
Spike,"If I could, yeah."
Willow,"You know, this doesn't make you any less terrifying."
Spike,Don't patronize me.
Graham,I'm getting a picture... Signature's locked.
Riely,What've we got?
Graham,"Humans of the freshman variety. 98.6, 98.6... Bingo! Got a cold one."
Riley,We're going in. I need a lockdown on grid 6.
Spike,I'm only 126.
Riley,"No, hold your fire!"
Spike,Aah!
Commando,Move!
Riely,Leave her.
Commando,"We can't neglect quarantine, sir!"
Commando,Stop her!
Commando,She's contained.
All,Aah! Ow! I'm blind! What the hell was that?
Riley,Abort!
Walsh,I'm sure you'll understand if I seem far from happy.
Riley,"Yes, ma'am. If you read my report you'll see--"
Forrest,"Whoever he was, the guy was big."
Graham,"Strong, too."
Riley,Whoever... Or whatever.
Walsh,"Yes, you will. Dismissed."
Riley,Hey.
Buffy,Hi.
Riley,"Listen, sorry about last night."
Riely,"I hear that. Gotta be careful, though. Lotta strange... People out there."
Buffy,"Oh, yeah."
Riley,How's willow doing?
Buffy,"Ok. 'Course, that stupid fraternity prank on our dorm didn't help any."
Riley,That's right. I forgot you guys live in stevenson.
Buffy,You knew that?
Buffy,Really? That work out for you?
Riley,Don't know yet.
Buffy,"Uh, last night... At the party, You wanted to tell me something?"
Buffy,You're a little peculiar.
Riley,I can live with that.
