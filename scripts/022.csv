Buffy,"(out of breath) Okay, one more time. You're the who?!"
Kendra,I'm de Slayer.
Buffy,Nice cover story. But here's a tip: you might wanna try it on  someone who's not the real Slayer.
Kendra,"Ya can't stop me! Even if ya kill me, anodder Slayer will be  sent to take me place."
Buffy,Could you stop with the Slayer thing? I'm the damn Slayer!
Kendra,"Nonsense! Dere is but one, and I am she."
Buffy,"Okay, (sniffs) a scenario. (holds up her hand) You back off,  I'll back off, but you promise not to go all wiggy until we can go to my  Watcher and figure this out."
Kendra,Wiggy?
Buffy,"You know. No kick-o, no fight-o?"
Kendra,I accept your scenario.
Buffy,So. You were sent here?
Kendra,"Yes, by my Watcher."
Buffy,"To do what, exactly?"
Kendra,To do my duty. I am here to kill vampires.
Giles,"And your Watcher is, i-is Sam Zabuto, you say?"
Kendra,"Yes, sir."
Giles,"We've never met, but he, he's, he's very well-respected."
Buffy,"What, so he's a real guy? As in non-fictional?"
Giles,And you are called...?
Kendra,I am de Vampire Slayer.
Buffy,"We got that part, hon. He means your name."
Kendra,"Oh. Dey call me Kendra. I have no last name, sir."
Buffy,(haughty) Can you say 'stuck in the 80's'?
Giles,"Buffy, please. Uh, there's obviously some, some misunderstanding  here."
Willow,(greets them) Hey!
Kendra,Identify yourself!
Buffy,"Back off, pink ranger! This is my friend."
Kendra,Friend?
Buffy,Yeah. As in person you hang with? Amigo?
Kendra,I don't understand.
Buffy,"(to Giles, exasperated) You try. I'm tapped. (sits)"
Giles,"Uh-uh, Kendra, uh, there are a-a-a few people, uh, ci-civilians  if you like, who, who know Buffy's identity. Willow is one of them, a-a- and they also, um, spend time together, uh, socially."
Kendra,"And you allow dis, sir?"
Giles,"Well, uh..."
Kendra,But de Slayer must work in secret for security.
Giles,"Of course, uh, but, uh, with Buffy, however, it-it's, um, some  flexibility is required."
Kendra,Why?
Willow,"(confused) Hi, guys. W-what's goin' on? (goes to sit across  from Buffy)"
Buffy,Apparently there's been a really big mix-up.
Giles,"Uh, it seems somehow that, uh, another Slayer has been sent to  Sunnydale."
Willow,"Is that even possible? I mean, two Slayers at the same time?"
Giles,"Not to my knowledge. Um, th-the new Slayer is only called after  the previous Slayer has died. Uh... (realizes) Oh, good Lord! You were  dead, Buffy."
Buffy,I was only gone for a minute.
Giles,"Clearly it doesn't matter how long you were gone. You were  physically dead! Thus causing the activation of the, the next Slayer.  (nods toward Kendra)"
Kendra,She died?
Buffy,Just a little.
Giles,"She drowned, but she was revived."
Willow,So there really are two of them!
Giles,It would seem so. This is completely unprecedented! I'm quite  flummoxed. (sits)
Buffy,"What's the flum? It's a mistake, she isn't supposed to be here,  she goes home! (to Kendra) Look, no offense, I really don't mean this  personally, but I'm not dead, and frankly having you around creeps me  out just a little bit."
Kendra,I cannot just leave. I was sent here for a reason. Mr. Zabuto  said all de signs indicate dat a very dark power is about to rise in  Sunnydale.
Buffy,(gets up) And what's your great plan for finding this dark  power? You just gonna attack people randomly till you find a bad one?
Kendra,Of course not.
Buffy,Then why the hell did you attack me?
Kendra,I tought you were a vampire.
Buffy,"Oh, a swing and a miss for the rookie. (walks around Kendra to  Willow)"
Kendra,I had good reason to tink you were. Did I not see you kissing a  vampire?
Willow,(stands up in her defense) Buffy would never do that!  (realizes) Oh. (to Buffy) Except for that sometimes you do that. (to  Kendra) But only with Angel. (to Buffy) Right? (sits again)
Buffy,"Yes! Right. (to Kendra) Look, you saw me with Angel, and he is a  vampire, but he's good."
Kendra,Angel? You mean Angelus? I've read about him. He is a monster.
Giles,"No, no, no, he's, he's good now."
Willow,(smiles) Really!
Buffy,He had a gypsy curse.
Kendra,He has a what?
Buffy,"Y'know what, just trust me on this one, okay? He's on the home  team now."
Kendra,I cannot believe you. He looked to me just like anodder animal  when I...
Buffy,When you what? (confronts her) What did you do to him?
Kendra,I...
Buffy,What did you do?!
Willy,"There you go, friend. He'll be as good as new in a day or so."
Willy,"Uh, hey, wai-wait. We had a deal, right?"
Spike,"(pulls out a wad of cash) What's the matter, Willy? Don't you  trust me? (starts handing him bills)"
Willy,"Oh, yeah. Like a brother."
Spike,Talk and I'll have your guts for garters.
Willy,Wild horses couldn't drag it.
Spike,"Oops! Sorry, friend."
Willy,What are you gonna do with him anyway?
Spike,"I'm thinkin' maybe dinner and a movie. I don't want to rush into  anything. I've been hurt, you know."
Cordelia,"Do you have anything in raisin? I know you wouldn't think so,  but I'm both a winter and a summer."
Norman,"Nine ninety-nine, tax included."
Cordelia,You said that already. Do you have anything in the berry  family?
Norman,Are there more ladies in the house?
Cordelia,"Oh, no, they're not home. (faces him) You know, nothing  personal, but maybe you should look into selling dictionaries, or...  some..."
Xander,"Hey, what's up?"
Cordelia,"Um, he's a salesman, and he was just leaving, right? Uh,  okay! Buh-bye! Thank you!"
Xander,"(reaches up to guide him out) Okay, Mary Kay, time to..."
Xander,Time to run!
Xander,Find something to cover the crack under the door!
Cordelia,Uhh... (finds a roll of duct tape) Here! I don't do worms.
Xander,Cover me!
Cordelia,Eww! Eh! Eh!
Buffy,Angel?!
Kendra,No ashes.
Buffy,What?
Kendra,"When a vampire combusts, he leaves ashes."
Buffy,"Yeah, I know the drill."
Kendra,So I did not kill him.
Buffy,And I don't need to kill *you*.
Willy,Whoa! There's a lotta tension in this room.
Buffy,Doesn't anyone just say 'hello' where you come from?
Kendra,Dis one is dirty! I can *feel* it!
Buffy,"That's really good for you, Percepto Girl, (lifts him up) but  we're not gonna get anything out of him if he's, oh, say, (slams him  into the bar) unconscious. (to Willy) Where's Angel?"
Willy,My buddy Angel? You think I'd let him fry? I saved him in the  nick! He was about five minutes away from being a crispy critter.
Buffy,Where'd he go?
Willy,"Uh, he said he was gonna stay underground. You know, recuperate."
Buffy,Are you telling me the truth?
Willy,"I swear on my mother's grave! Should something fatal happen to  her, God forbid."
Kendra,Den he is alright. We can return to your Watcher for our  orders.
Buffy,(lets go of Willy) I don't take orders. I do things my way.
Kendra,No wonder you died.
Buffy,(ignores the comment) Let's go.
Willy,"I, I have to ask. (the girls looks back) Has either of you girls  considered modeling? I have a friend with a camera? Strictly high-class  nude work. You know, art photographs. But naked."
Willy,You don't have to answer right away.
Drusilla,(moans) I was dreaming.
Spike,"Of what, pet?"
Drusilla,We were in Paris. You had a branding iron.
Spike,I brought you something.
Drusilla,And there were worms in my baguette.
Spike,"(drags Angel in) Your sire, my sweet. (dumps him on the floor)"
Drusilla,My Angel?
Spike,"(comes back to the bed) The one and only. Now all we need's the  full moon tonight, and he will die, and you will be fully restored.  (takes her hand, whispers) My black goddess. (kisses her hand) My ripe,  (works his way up her arm) wicked plum. (raises his head) It's been..."
Drusilla,Forever.
Drusilla,"Spike, let me have him. Hmm? Until the moon."
Spike,"(smiles) Alright, you can play, but don't kill him. He mustn't  die till the ritual."
Drusilla,Bring him to me.
Drusilla,You've been a very bad daddy.
Giles,"Kendra, I-I've, uh, conferred with your Watcher, Mr. Zabuto,  and, uh, we both agree that, uh, until this matter with Spike and  Drusilla has been resolved that you two should work together."
Buffy,"Oh, that'll be a treat."
Kendra,"So, you believe dat Spike is attempting to revive dis Drusilla  to health?"
Giles,"Yes, well, I-I-I-I think that's the, uh, the dark power that  your, your Watcher re-referred to. You see, uh, you see Drusilla's not  only evil, she's, uh, well, she's also quite mad, and-and-and-and if  she's restored to her full health, then, uh, well, there's no,  absolutely no telling what she might do."
Kendra,Den we will stop Spike.
Buffy,"Ooo, good plan, let's go, charge!"
Giles,Buffy...
Buffy,"It's a little more complicated than that, John Wayne."
Giles,"Yes, I'm, I'm afraid it is. You see, Spike has also called out  the Order of Taraka to keep Buffy out of the way."
Kendra,De assassins? I read of dem in de writings of Dramius.
Giles,"Oh, really? W-w-which volume?"
Kendra,"I believe it was six, sir."
Buffy,"Um, how do you know all this?"
Kendra,From me studies.
Buffy,"So, obviously you have a lot of free time."
Kendra,I study because it is required. (Giles smiles) The Slayer  handbook insists on it.
Willow,There's a Slayer handbook?
Buffy,Wait. Handbook? What handbook? How come I don't have a handbook?
Willow,"Is there a T-shirt, too? (gets a look from Buffy) 'Cause that  would be cool... (rolls her eyes)"
Giles,"After meeting you, Buffy, I realized that, uh, the handbook  would be of no use in your case."
Buffy,"Well, what do you mean it would be of no use in my case? Wha- what's wrong with my case?"
Giles,"Uh, Kendra, um, perhaps you'd like to show me the, the part in,  uh, Dramius Six where, uh, uh, where it refers to the Order of Taraka.  Really, I-I, I seem to have never been able to get through that book. It  was a bit stodgy."
Kendra,(smiles) It was difficult. All dose footnotes.
Buffy,"(to Willow) Hello, and welcome to planet pocket protector."
Giles,"Oh, well, B-Buffy, Principal Snyder was snooping round after  you."
Buffy,(stops) Eee. Career fair.
Giles,"Best make an appearance, I think."
Buffy,Right.
Kendra,Buffy's a student here?
Giles,Yes.
Kendra,"Riiight, of course. And I imagine she's a cheerleader as well."
Giles,"Oh, no, well, a-a-actually she had to give up her cheerleading.  (gets a look from Kendra) Uh, it was quite an amusing story, actually.  Uh, uh, let's go and find the book, shall we?"
Buffy,Get a load of the she-Giles.
Willow,Creepy.
Buffy,Ew. I'll bet Giles wishes I was more of a book geek.
Willow,Giles is enough of a book geek for the both of you.
Buffy,"Yeah, but did you see how they were vibing? (mocks them) Volume  six, ha, ha, ha!"
Willow,"Buffy, no one could replace you. You'll always be Giles'  favorite."
Buffy,I wonder.
Willow,"Of course, you will. You're *his* Slayer. The *real* Slayer."
Buffy,"No. I wonder if it would be so bad, being replaced."
Willow,"You mean, like, letting Kendra take over?"
Buffy,"Maybe. I mean, maybe after this thing with Spike and the  assassins is over, I could say, 'Kendra, you slay, I'm going to  Disneyland.'"
Willow,"But not forever, right?"
Buffy,"No, Disneyland would get boring after a few months. But I could  do other stuff. Career day stuff. Maybe I could even have a normal life."
Xander,"Could you sit down, or change your pattern or something? You're  making me queasy."
Cordelia,(leans on the washer) Because you're just sitting there. You  should be thinking up a *plan*.
Xander,I have a plan. We wait. Buffy saves us.
Cordelia,How will she even know where to find us?
Xander,"Cordelia, this is Buffy's house. Odds are she'll find us."
Cordelia,"Well, what if she doesn't? What am I supposed to do? Just  waste away down here with you? Haw, haw, no thank you! (makes tracks for  the stairs)"
Xander,(gets up to stop her) What are you doin'?
Cordelia,(stops and faces him) Going to see if he's gone!
Xander,That's brilliant! What if he isn't?
Cordelia,"Oh, right! You think we should just slack here and hope that  somebody else *decides* to be a hero? (goes back to the washer) Sorry,  forgot I was stranded with a LOSER! (leans and crosses her arms)"
Xander,And yet I never forgot that I'm stuck with the numb-brain that  let Mr. Mutant in the house in the FIRST PLACE!
Cordelia,HE LOOKED NORMAL!
Xander,"What, is he supposed to have an arrow with the word 'assassin'  over his head?! All it took was the prospect of a free makeover, and you  licked his hand like a big, dumb dog!"
Cordelia,You know what? (heads for the stairs again) I'm going.
Cordelia,I'd rather be worm food than look at *your* pathetic face!
Xander,Then go! I'm not stopping ya!
Cordelia,I bet you wouldn't! I bet you'd let a girl go off to her doom  all by herself!
Xander,Not just any girl. (nods) You're special.
Cordelia,I can't believe that I'm stuck spending what will probably be  my last few moments on Earth here WITH YOU!
Xander,"I *hope* these are my last few moments! Three more seconds with  you, and I'm gonna... (steps closer)"
Cordelia,(steps closer) I'm gonna what? Coward!
Xander,Moron!
Cordelia,I *hate* you!
Xander,I HATE YOU!
Xander,We *so* need to get outta here.
Cordelia,(nods) Mm-hm!
Cordelia,He's gone.
Cordelia,"Xander, oh my God! Get them off of me!"
Cordelia,Get 'em off!
Cordelia,"(terrified) Get 'em off of me! Oh, my God, get 'em off me!  (screams)"
Cordelia,"Okay, okay, let's get outta here! Xander, let's go!"
Cordelia,Okay! Let's go!
Buffy,My tests say that I should look into law enforcement -- duh! --  and environmental design.
Willow,"Environmental design. That's landscaping, right?"
Buffy,"I checked the 'shrub' box. But landscaping was yesterday, so law  enforcement it is."
Buffy,"(to Willow) Hey, Will, don't look, okay, but... (Willow looks)  No, don't look! (smiles) That guy over there is totally checking you  out."
Willow,"(looks with her eyes) Oh, that's Oz. He's expressing computer  nerd solidarity."
Buffy,Really? Then why is he on his way over here right now?
Buffy,Told you! (makes a discreet exit)
Oz,Hey.
Willow,(smiles) Hey! (notices) Your hair! Is brown!
Oz,"Oh, yeah, sometimes. So, uh, did you decide? Are you gonna be a  Corporate Computer Suit Guy?"
Willow,"Oh. Uh, well, I-I think I'm gonna finish high school first.  What about you?"
Oz,"I'm not really a computer person, you know. Or a work of any kind  person."
Willow,They why'd they select you?
Oz,"Oh, I sorta test well. Y'know, which is cool. E-except that it  leads to jobs."
Willow,"Well, don't you have some ambition?"
Oz,"Oh, yeah! Yeah. E-flat, diminished ninth."
Willow,Huh?
Oz,"Well, the E-flat, it's, it's doable, but that diminished ninth,  y'know, it's a man's chord. Now, you could lose a finger."
Patrice,"Alright, listen up, and answer when I call your name. Buffy  Summers."
Buffy,GET DOWN!
Oz,LOOK OUT!
Buffy,How is he?
Willow,He's shot! (to Oz) Are you okay?
Oz,"I, uh, I'm shot! (takes his hand away briefly and chuckles) Y'know.  (laughs) Wow! It's odd! And painful."
Kendra,She's gone.
Jonathon,W-was that a demonstration?
Buffy,"She was definitely one of the Taraka gang, Giles, and way gun  happy."
Giles,"This, um, Oz chap, he, he, he's alright?"
Willow,The paramedic said it was only a scrape. Thank goodness.
Buffy,"Down, girl!"
Xander,Who sponsored career day today? The British Soccer Fan  Association?
Giles,"(on his way to the table) We had a, a rather violent visit from  the Order of Taraka."
Xander,You wanna talk Order of Taraka? We just met the king *freak* of  the... (sees Kendra) Hello.
Giles,"Oh, forgive me. Uh, Xander, Cordelia, this is Kendra. Uh, i-it's  rather complicated, but she's also a Slayer."
Cordelia,(heads for the table) Hi. Nice to meet you.
Xander,"A Slayer, huh? (to Buffy) I knew this 'I'm the only one, I'm  the only one' thing was just an attention-getter."
Buffy,"(hops off of the counter) Just say hello, Xander. (makes for the  table with Willow)"
Xander,"Welcome. So! You're a Slayer, huh? I like that in a woman."
Kendra,"(nervous) Uh... I hope... I tank you... I mean, sir, um... I  will be of service."
Xander,(looks at the others) Great! (to Kendra) Good. It's good to be  a giver. (goes to the table)
Giles,"Xander, um, this, this, uh, assassin you encountered, what, uh,  what did he look like?"
Cordelia,"Uhh! Uhh! Ohmigod, I'm showering! (runs from the library)"
Xander,(indicates the mealworm) Like that.
Buffy,"You and bug people, Xander. What's up with that?"
Xander,"No, but this dude was completely different than praying mantis  lady. He was a man *of* bugs, not a man who *was* a bug."
Giles,"The, uh, the-the-the important thing is everybody's alright.  Still, it's quite apparent that we're under serious attack."
Buffy,"These Taraka are definitely serious. (looks at Kendra)  Fortunately for me, so is Kendra."
Giles,"And, uh, I fear the worst is still to come. I've, I-I've  discovered the remaining keys to Drusilla's cure. The, uh, the ritual  requires that, the presence of her sire, and it must take place in a  church on the night of the new moon."
Kendra,The new moon. But that is tonight.
Giles,Exactly. And I-I'm sure the assassins were here to kill Buffy  before she could put a stop to things.
Buffy,They need Drusilla's sire. You mean the vamp that made her?
Giles,Yes.
Willow,"Buffy, what is it?"
Buffy,(looks down) Angel. He's Drusilla's sire.
Xander,"Man, that guy got major neck in his day!"
Buffy,Will this ritual kill him?
Giles,"Yes, I'm afraid it will."
Buffy,We need to find this church. We need to find where this ritual  is gonna take place!
Giles,"Agreed, and we must work quickly. (checks his watch) We have  five hours before sundown."
Willow,"(opens her laptop) Don't worry, Buffy, we'll save Angel."
Kendra,Angel? But our priority is to stop Drusilla!
Xander,Angel's our friend! Except I don't like him.
Buffy,"Look, you've got your priorities, and I've got mine. Right now  they mesh. So, are you gonna help me, or are you gonna get out of my  way?"
Kendra,(considers) I'm wit you.
Buffy,"Good. 'Cause I've had it. Spike is going down. You can attack  me, you can send assassins after me, that's fine. But nobody messes with  my boyfriend!"
Drusilla,The lamb is caught in the blackberry patch. (approaches  Angel) My mummy ate lemons. Raw.
Drusilla,She said she loved the way they made her mouth... (runs her  hand down and up his chest) tingle. Little Anne.
Drusilla,Her favorite was custard... brandied pears.
Angel,Dru...
Drusilla,(sternly) Shhh! (stands up) And pomegranates. (climbs onto  the bed behind Angel) They used to make her face and fingers aaall red.
Drusilla,Remember? Hmm? Little fingers. Little hands. Do you?
Angel,(shivering in pain) If I could...
Drusilla,"(interrupts angrily) Bite your tongue! They used to eat cake,  and eggs, and honey. (sweetly) Until you came and ripped their throats  out."
Giles,There are forty-three churches in Sunnydale? (pulls out a roll  of mints) That seems a little excessive. (tears off some wrapping)
Willow,It's the extra evil vibe from the Hellmouth. Makes people pray  harder.
Giles,"Well, check and see if any of them are closed or abandoned."
Xander,"Yeah, yeah, we got monsters, we got demons, but no bug dude or  police lady."
Giles,"Well, you should have better luck with this one. There's a whole  section devoted to the Order of Taraka."
Kendra,"And dose two, dey also know you are de Slayer?"
Buffy,Yep.
Kendra,Did anyone explain to you what 'secret identity' means? (goes  to the desk)
Buffy,Nope. Must be in the handbook. (Kendra picks up the crossbow)  Right after the chapter on personality removal. Be careful with that  thing!
Kendra,Please. I'm an expert in all weapons.
Giles,Is everything alright?
Buffy,"Yeah, it's okay. Kendra killed the bad lamp."
Kendra,"Sorry! Dis, uh, trigger mechanism is different. (sets the bow  down) Perhaps when dis is over you can, uh, show me how to work it."
Buffy,When this is over I'm thinking pineapple pizza and teen video  movie fest. Possibly something from the Ringwald oeuvre.
Xander,"Oh, here we go! I am the bug man, coo coo ka choo."
Xander,Okay. Okay. He can only be killed when he's in his disassembled  state. (to Cordelia) Disassembled. That means when he's broken down into  his liiittle buggy parts.
Cordelia,"I know what it means, *dorkhead*."
Xander,(takes mock offense) Dorkhead! You slash me with your words!
Kendra,Your life is very different dan mine.
Buffy,"You mean the part where I occasionally have one? Yeah, I guess  it is. (carves at a stake)"
Kendra,"De tings you do and have, I was taught, distract from my  calling. Friends, school... even family."
Buffy,Even family?
Kendra,"My parents, dey sent me to my Watcher when I was very young."
Buffy,How young?
Kendra,"I don't remember dem, actually. I've seen pictures. But, uh,  dat's how seriously de calling is taken by my people. My modder and  fadder gave me to my Watcher because dey believed dat dey were doing de  right ting for me, and for de world. (puts down the stake and gets a  sympathetic look from Buffy) Please, I don't feel sorry for meself. Why  should you?"
Buffy,"I don't know, I... I guess it just sounds very lonely."
Kendra,"Emotions are weakness, Buffy. You shouldn't entertain dem."
Buffy,"Kendra, my emotions give me power. They're total assets!"
Kendra,(picks up her knife) Maybe. For you. But I prefer to keep an  even mind. (wipes the blade)
Buffy,(puts down her knife) Mm. I guess that explains it.
Kendra,Explains what?
Buffy,"(plays with the stake) Oh, well, when we were fighting, uh,  you're amazing! Your technique, it's flawless, it's, hmm, better than  mine."
Kendra,I know.
Buffy,"Still, I woulda kicked your butt in the end. And ya know why? No  imagination."
Kendra,(rubs her blade more vigorously) Really? Ya tink so? (puts down  the rag)
Buffy,"Oh, I know so. You're good, but power alone isn't enough. A good  fighter needs to know how to improvise, to go with the flow. Uh-uh,  seriously, don't get me wrong, y-you really do have potential. (puts  away the stake)"
Kendra,(holds her knife ready) Potential? I could wipe de floor wit  you right now!
Buffy,(looks Kendra in the eye) That would be anger you're feeling.
Kendra,What?
Buffy,"You feel it, right? How the anger gives you fire? A Slayer needs  that."
Xander,"Excuse me, ladies."
Xander,Nice knife. (leaves the office)
Buffy,I'm guessing dating isn't big with your Watcher either.
Kendra,I'm not permitted to speak with boys.
Buffy,Unless you're pummeling them. (has a realization) Wait a minute.
Kendra,What?
Buffy,That guy! The sleazoid you nearly decked in the bar.
Kendra,You tink he might help us?
Buffy,I tink we might make him!
Drusilla,"Say 'Uncle'. (lowers the pitcher) Oh, that's right, you  killed my uncle."
Spike,"That's it, then. (Drusilla looks up at him) Off to church."
Drusilla,(stands up) It makes pretty colors.
Spike,Pft! I'll see him die soon enough. I've never been much for the  pre-show.
Angel,"Too bad. That's what Drusilla likes best, as I recall."
Spike,What's that supposed to mean? (steps over to the other bond)
Angel,Ask her. She knows what I mean.
Spike,Well?
Drusilla,(to Angel) Shhh! Grrrruff! Bad dog.
Angel,"You shoulda let me talk to him, Dru. Sounds like your boy could  use some pointers. She likes to be teased."
Spike,Keep your hole shut! (stands over him)
Angel,"Take care of her, Spike. The way she touched me just now? I can  tell when she's not satisfied."
Spike,I said SHUT UP!
Angel,Or maybe you two just don't have the fire we had.
Spike,That's enough.
Drusilla,"Spike, no!"
Drusilla,Shhh.
Spike,"Oh! Right. Right, you almost got me! Aren't you a 'throw himself  to the lions' sort of sap these days. Well, the lions are on to you,  baby. See, if I kill you now you go quick, and Dru hasn't got a chance.  And if Dru dies your little Rebecca of Sunnyhell Farm and all her mates  are spared her coming-out party. (squeezes Angel's throat)"
Drusilla,"Spike, the moon is rising. It's time."
Spike,"Too bad, Angelus. Looks like you go the hard way. Along with the  rest of this miserable town."
Willy,Ah! Honest! I don't know where Angel is!
Buffy,What about this ritual? What have you heard?
Willy,N-nothing! I-it's all hush-hush!
Kendra,"Just hit him, Buffy!"
Buffy,(to Willy) She likes to hit.
Willy,"You know, m-maybe I did hear something about this ritual. Yeah,  i-i... I-it's coming back to me. But, uh, I'd have to take you there."
Buffy,Let's go. (starts to drag him out of the bar)
Kendra,First we must return to de Watcher.
Buffy,"(stops) Excuse me? While we run to Giles, this whole thing could  go down!"
Kendra,But it is procedure.
Buffy,"It's brainless, you mean! If we don't go now, Angel could die.  (starts out again)"
Kendra,Is dat all you're worried about? Your boyfriend?
Buffy,"(stops again) No, it's not all, but it's enough."
Kendra,It's as I feared. He clouds your judgment. We can't stop dis  ritual alone!
Buffy,Are you listening to me? He could die!
Kendra,He's a vampire. He *should* die. Why am I de only person who  sees it?
Kendra,Are you dat big a fool?
Kendra,"(exhales) Good riddance, den."
Willy,Here ya go. Don't ever say your friend Willy don't come through  in a pinch.
Willy,Here ya go. Don't ever say your friend Willy don't come through  in a pinch.
Spike,"Eligor. I name thee. Bringer of war, poisoners, pariahs, grand  obscenity."
Spike,"Eligor, wretched master of decay, bring your black medicine."
Drusilla,Black medicine.
Spike,"Come. (holds up the cross upside-down) Restore your most  impious, murderous child."
Drusilla,Murderous child.
Spike,From the blood of the sire she is risen.
Spike,"From the blood of the sire, she shall rise again."
Spike,"Right, then! Now we just let them come to a simmering boil, and  remove to a low flame."
Willy,"It's payday, pal. I got your Slayer."
Spike,(angry) Are you tripping?! You bring her here?! Now?!
Willy,You said you wanted her.
Spike,"In the ground, pinhead! I wanted her dead."
Willy,"Now, that's not what I heard. Word was there was a bounty on her  dead or alive."
Spike,"You heard wrong, Willy."
Buffy,(whispers) Angel.
Spike,"Yeah. (steps over to Buffy) It bugs me, too, seeing him like  that. Another five minutes, though, and Angel will be dead, so... I  forebear. Don't feel too bad for Angel, though, he's got something you  don't have."
Buffy,(angry) What's that?
Spike,Five minutes. Patrice!
Spike,Who the hell is this?!
Buffy,"It's your lucky day, Spike."
Kendra,Two Slayers! (decks him)
Buffy,No waiting! (jabs him)
Xander,"Hey, larvae boy! (Norman sees him) Yeah, that's right, I'm  talkin' to you, ya big cootie!"
Xander,"Welcome, my little pretties!"
Buffy,Switch!
Spike,I'd rather be fightin' you anyway.
Buffy,Mutual.
Cordelia,"Die! Die, die, die! Die!"
Xander,"I think he did, Cordy."
Spike,Where are you going?
Willy,"Now, there's a way in which this isn't my fault!"
Spike,They tricked you.
Willy,Mm-hm! They were duplicitous!
Spike,"Well, then I'll only kill you just this once. (goes for the  bite)"
Drusilla,(weakly) Spike!
Willow,Hold him steady!
Kendra,Dat's me favrit shirt! Dat's me *only* shirt!
Xander,Look out!
Spike,"Sorry, baby. Gotta go."
Spike,Hope that was enough.
Buffy,I'm good!
Buffy,(quietly) Hi.
Kendra,Let's get him out!
Buffy,Careful!
Kendra,C'mon.
Oz,"Oh, hey! (offers the box) Animal cracker?"
Willow,"(smiles) No, thank you. How's your arm?"
Oz,(tries to open the box) Suddenly painless.
Willow,You can still play the guitar okay?
Oz,"Oh, not well, but not worse."
Willow,"Y'know, I never really thanked you."
Oz,"Ooo, yeah, please don't. I don't do thanks. (Willow hands back the  open box) I get all red. Have to bail. It's not pretty."
Willow,"(smiles) Well, then forget that thing. E-especially with the  part where I kind of owe you my life."
Oz,"(pulls out a cookie and stops) Oh, look! Monkey! And he has a  little hat. And little pants."
Willow,"(smiles) Yeah, I-I see!"
Oz,"The monkey's the only cookie animal that gets to wear clothes, you  know that?"
Oz,You have the sweetest smile I've ever seen.
Oz,"(continues down the hall) So, I'm wondering, do the other cookie  animals feel sorta ripped? Like, is the hippo going, 'Hey, man, where  are *my* pants? I have my hippo dignity!'"
Oz,"And you know the monkey's just, (with a French accent) 'I mock you  with my monkey pants!'"
Oz,And there's a big coup in the zoo.
Willow,The monkey is French?
Oz,All monkeys are French. You didn't know that?
Willow,No. (giggles)
Xander,We need to talk.
Xander,"Okay, uh-uh-uh... here's the deal. We don't have to run every  time we see each other in the hall."
Cordelia,Right. Okay. Why shouldn't we run?
Xander,"What happened, there's a total explanation for it."
Cordelia,You're a pervert?
Xander,Me?
Cordelia,Yeah!
Xander,"No-no-no-no! (takes a step closer) I seem to recall I was the  jumpee, my friend!"
Cordelia,As if! (takes a step closer) You've probably been planning  this for months!
Xander,"Right, I hired a Latvian bug man to kill Buffy so I could kiss  you. I hate to burst your bubble, but you don't inspire me to spring for  a dinner over at Bucky's Fondue Hut."
Cordelia,"Fine! Whatever. (starts to leave, but steps back, closer) You  know, the point is: don't try it again!"
Xander,"I didn't try it! (calms a bit) Forget about the bugs, okay? The  memory of your lips on mine makes my blood run cold."
Cordelia,(steps closer) If you dare breathe a word of this...
Xander,Like I want anyone to know!
Cordelia,Then it's erased!
Xander,Never happened!
Cordelia,Good!
Xander,Good!
Cordelia,*Good*!
Kendra,"Tank you for de shirt, it was very generous of you."
Buffy,"Hey, it looks better on... well, me, but no worries. Now, when  you get to the airport..."
Kendra,"I get on de plane with me ticket, and sit in a seat. Not de  cargo hold."
Buffy,Very good.
Kendra,Dat is *not* traveling under cover.
Buffy,"Exactly. Relax! You earned it. Sit in your seat, you eat your  peanuts, you watch the movie, well, unless it's about a dog or Chevy  Chase."
Kendra,I'll remember. (opens the cab door)
Buffy,"I, um... I just wanted to thank you... for helping me save  Angel."
Kendra,Mm. Am not tellin' me Watcher about dat. It is too strange dat  a Slayer loves a vampire.
Buffy,(smirks) Tell me about it.
Kendra,"Still, he is pretty cute."
Buffy,"Well, maybe they won't fire me for dating him."
Kendra,You always do dat.
Buffy,Do what?
Kendra,You talk about slaying like it's a job. It's not. It's who you  are.
Buffy,Did you get that from your handbook?
Kendra,From you.
Buffy,I guess it's something I really can't fight. (smiles) I'm a  freak.
Kendra,Not de only freak.
Buffy,Not anymore.
Kendra,I don't hug.
Buffy,Right. No. Good. Hate hugs.
Drusilla,"Don't worry, dear heart."
Drusilla,I'll see that you get strong again.
Drusilla,Like me!
