character,dialogue
Buffy,So Maggie sends me down into the sewers with one of those blasto guns and the next thing I know it's raining monsters.
Xander,Hallelujah.
Buffy,And then this gate slams down behind me and I-I try to use the gun but it goes pfft.
Giles,You're saying that Maggie Walsh set you up?
Buffy,That's exactly what I'm saying. She sent me on a one way recon.
Spike,Got to hand it to you goldilocks - you do have bleeding tragic taste in men. I've got a cousin married to a regurgitating {{frovilops}} demon {that's} got better instincts than you.
Buffy,What does my taste in men have to do with this?
Spike,You think Riley was out knitting booties for your future offspring while Maggie stringing you up?
Buffy,You guys think Riley had something to do with this.
Giles,"Um, probably not but we, uh, be remiss if we didn't think all the possibilities {through}."
Buffy,"{Great./Right.} Remiss.  No! No, Maggie made sure that he was nowhere around when she sent me on this very special make Buffy dead assignment."
Willow,Plus Riley he seems like he wouldn't tell a little white lie let alone a whole bunch of big dirty ones.
Xander,"That's why they call it the secret forces Will, cause they kinda keep the whole lying thing to themselves."
Buffy,All I know is that Maggie has it in for me which means the Initiative has it in for me.
Xander,I'm guessing the mad scientist isn't too keen on the fact that the entire scooby gang knows that the Initiative is up to no good.
Buffy,Which brings us back to the not safe for any of us concept.
Giles,What could have happened to make Professor Walsh want to kill you?
Buffy,"I don't know, uh.  She wasn't keen on the fact that I was asking a lot of questions that's for sure."
Anya,So you were getting too close to something.
Giles,Clearly. Although one can only imagine what she'd be so desperate to hide.
Buffy,Everybody grab a weapon. We've gotta move.
Xander,Storm the Initiative.  Yeah let's take on those suckers.
Buffy,I was thinking more that we'd hide.
Xander,Oh thank God.
Giles,I think perhaps we should talk about this.
Buffy,We need to relocate someplace we're less likely to be found. We need to come up with a plan.
Willow,We could go to my place.
Buffy,"The Initiative guys know how close we are.  They'll automatically check the places that you hang out.  Xander, what about your basement?  The guys haven't seen us together that much and there's enough room."
Willow,Ooh Plus mirrored ball.
Xander,Cool! Come on down and boogie at Xander's hideaway.
Giles,Absolutely not! I will not squat in that dank hole.
Spike,"What, it was good enough for me, but you're above it all?"
Giles,Precisely.  Besides I-I don't see why we can't stay right where we are.  Pfft.  It's very unlikely that those Initiative boys are going to come round here to look for uh_
Riley,Buffy!  God Buffy are you ok?  What happened?
Buffy,You know?
Riley,I know something went down.  umph.  Tell me.
Buffy,Maggie tried to kill me.
Anya,"It didn't work, but they're all upset anyway."
Riley,Ok listen I need you to go over everything step by step. There has to be..has to be some kind of mistake
Xander,There was no mistake. And how do you know something happened?
Riley,I was on a mission but I came back and... I'm not sure..  Look let's just keep her heads and not jump to any _
Buffy,What?
Riley,That's hostile 17.
Spike,"No, I'm just a friend of Xaannderr's. Pfftt."
Spike,Bugger it.  I'm your guy.
Buffy,This is Spike. He's um.. It's a really long story b-but he's not bad anymore.
Spike,"Hey! What am I, a bleeding broken record? I'm bad it's just I can't bite anymore.  Thanks to you wankers."
Riley,We've been looking all over the place for him - but you've known where's he's been all along.
Buffy,It's not like that.
Riley,Then what is it like?.. What's he doing here?
Spike,"Leaving you swabs to your dramatics, thanks. I've got my stories on the telly for that."
Spike,By the by.  If you're trying to kill her.
Riley,"Buffy, what is this? You're hiding an H.S.T.?"
Xander,"Why don't you just back off and let her ask the questions, Jack?  Your boss just tried to make monster food out of her."
Buffy,What about 314? Maybe that's it.
Riley,Maybe she was trying to test you.  What if it was only a drill?
Buffy,Then why did she tell you I was dead?  Riley it wasn't a test.
Riley,No! That's - that's not what happens there.
Buffy,Riley!
Riley,I would know!
Buffy,"No one is sure of anything, ok?  We're were just trying to sort it out."
Riley,I can't be here.  I'll sort it out on my own.
Buffy,Riley.
Riley,"No.  Just, umph, I'm sorry."
Adam,What am I?
Boy,You're a monster.
Boy,Me? I'm a boy.
Adam,A boy. How do you work?
Boy,I don' know. I just do.
Boy,What's that for?
Engelman,Dr Walsh?
Engelman,Adam?
Buffy,That would never happen.
Willow,"Well, no Buff, that's why they call them cartoons, not documentaries."
Giles,Must we have the noise. My head is splitting.
Willow,"Well, look who's cranky bear in the morning."
Giles,Yes I can't imagine why I didn't sleep well in my beach ball.
Anya,Every time you moved it made squeaky noises.  It was irritating.
Giles,Really.  I'm surprised you could hear it over your Wagnerian snoring.
Buffy,"Ok you guys, could we not please?  Everything's screwed up enough without you two doing scenes from my parent's marriage."
Buffy,Thank you.
Willow,"It'll be ok Buffy, Riley's just confused, that's all."
Buffy,I don't know.  It just seems like things could get heavier. His whole world's falling apart.
Anya,And after everything you've been through with Angel.  You really should get yourself a boring boyfriend.  Like Xander.  You can't have Xander!
Buffy,That was the idea.  Riley was supposed to be Mr. {{Joe Guy.}}  We were going to do dumb things like hold hands through the daises going tra-la-la.
Willow,Poor Buffy.  Your life resists all things average.
Anya,So dump him.  But you can't have Xander!
Buffy,"I'll try and remember that.  It's too late anyway - I'm already at the I hurt when he hurts, I smile when he smiles stage."
Anya,I hate that part.
Buffy,I'll just have to make it work.
Xander,Turn on the tv.  Now!
Buffy,The Polgara demon had a skewer in its arm.  That's the one that Maggie insisted we bring back alive. Giles: She must have sent it after you.
Buffy,And it got distracted... God.
Willow,"Buffy, its not your fault."
Willow,How could you know?
Giles,She's right.  You mustn't blame yourself.
Buffy,I'm not going to.  I'm going to the crime scene to see what I can find out.
Buffy,"You guys research the Polgara demon.  I want to know where it is.  When I find it I'm going to make him pay for taking that kid's life, I'll make him die in ways he can't even imagine."
Forrest,"Hey.  Where've you been all night?  Well, congratulations.  I see you and Buffy have finally gotten past the shy phase."
Riley,"I wasn't with Buffy. I had to be alone, think some things through."
Forrest,What things?
Forrest,This is mighty ominous.  Forrest: What's up man?
Riley,"Professor Walsh tried to have Buffy killed.  Forrest: What? Did Buffy tell you that, I mean do you have any proof?"
Riley,I saw enough to know it's true.
Forrest,I don't get it. Why?
Riley,I dunno.  Buffy thinks that she's getting too close to something - that Professor Walsh has some secret.
Forrest,I wouldn't put it past Buffy to get on Professor Walsh's bad side.  She tends to put her nose where it doesn't belong.
Riley,What?
Forrest,She's a pain.  Always wanting to know why this and why that? Riley: And you're saying she should die because of that?
Forrest,I don't know.  Maybe Professor Walsh found out that Buffy was up to something bad.  That ever cross your mind?
Riley,Why does it bug you so much that I'm hanging with her?  Is it because she's a better soldier than you?
Forrest,It bugs me that she's using you to infiltrate our operation.
Riley,So you saying that she's a spy? Hmpph You're crazy.
Forrest,"Riley think about it.  The professor's not stupid, she tried to kill Buffy, maybe Buffy needed killing."
Graham,Guys.
Riley,Not now {Brian/Graham/Brad}.
Forrest,What is it?
Graham,Professor Walsh is dead.
Forrest,"Look at that wound.  She's been staked, wouldn't you say brother?"
Riley,What?
Forrest,Only one person I can think of that who could do something like that.
Riley,You better not be saying what I think you're saying.  When we don't know a person did this - the Polgara demon has skewers.
Forrest,{No way } man that's your girlfriend's m.o.
Riley,That's a serious accusation.  You better be ready to deal with the consequences.
Forrest,Bring em on. That supernatural freak has blinded you and I'm sick of it.
Riley,That's enough.
Engelman,"Stand back {man/Finn}. Show some respect.  Listen, everybody's upset but arguing isn't going to help anything and it's certainly not what Professor Walsh would want."
Riley,No sir.
Engelman,"Alright, good.  Now Washington is sending in a team to do an internal investigation.  I've been told we have to wait for their word.  Riley: What do you mean wait?  This has to be the work of the Polgara  demon we captured last week."
Engelman,Probably.  It looks like last night the Polgara escaped through tunnel 72. Riley: It's out loose somewhere?
Engelman,I'm afraid so.
Riley,Then we have to go after it.
Engelman,"My orders from Washington are for a total lock down until they arrive.  I'm sorry.  Now, return to your quarters. There's nothing you can do here."
Riley,"Listen. Engelman can talk all he wants, but I'm still in charge 'til the brass gets here and tells me otherwise and I say we've got a demon to hunt.  Now suit up for armed patrol And by that I mean loaded guns, men.  Target practice is over.  We're {going} for blood."
Forrest,Somebody's been staying here.
Graham,"What do you think, a homeless guy?"
Forrest,Could be - or a squatter of the demon variety.
Graham,Not the Polgara.
Forrest,Who cares?  I see a demon - it dies.
Graham,It's warm.
Forrest,Damn.
Forrest,Animals!
Riley,Buffy. Hey.  Buffy: Hey.
Buffy,Look I'm sorry about earlier.  I know that {{au burn??}} came on pretty strong.  And the Spike thing isn't as tweaked as it looks. Ok maybe it is but there's an explanation that almost makes sense. Hello.  I'm apologizing here.  And I-I think that's pretty big of me considering I'm the one who was almost made a demon sandwich.  This is the part where you throw me a bone.
Riley,Maggie's dead.  silence
Riley,Happy now?
Buffy,How can you ask me that?  Of course I'm not happy.  What happened?
Riley,That's classified.
Buffy,Classifie_ The Polgara.  It got her and escaped.  Didn't it?
Buffy,I'm gonna find it.  I'm gonna find it and destroy it.  And then you can stop asking me how happy all this death makes me.
Willow,Howdy.
Tara,I just got your message a minute ago. I was in class.  But I was about to call you.
Willow,"I had so much fun the other night, those spells."
Tara,"Yeah, that was nice."
Willow,"I hope you don't think that I just come over for the spells and everything.  I mean ,I really like just talking and hanging out with you and stuff."
Tara,I know that.  But you wanna do a spell.
Willow,Yeah.
Willow,But only because it's really important.  There's this..
Tara,No you don't have to explain I don't mind really. I've been uh thinking about that last spell we did...  all day.
Willow,You have?
Tara,Mmmhmmm.
Willow,Well this one should be really fun too.  We conjure the goddess Thespia to help us locate demonic energy in the area.
Tara,The goddess Thespia. Are you sure we're ready for that?
Willow,You and me!  This is beneath us.
Tara,Ok.  exhales Tara: If you say so.
Willy,You're killing me here.
Buffy,Oh missed you too.  Joint's jumping.
Willy,Yeah ya know.  I'm making some changes with my life.  Getting away from my old image.
Buffy,You mean as a double dealing snitch.
Willy,"Uh Hunh.  I know you're going think I'm blowing smoke, but after those Apocalypse demons nearly did me in I had an experience of the spiritual variety."
Buffy,That's swell really.  But I need to know if you've heard anything about a Polgara demon doing some killings in the last few days.
Willy,"You see that's the thing.  I don't talk behind people's backs no more.  And I'm bringing some class to the joint, ya know.  It's Willy's Place now, see.  Brings in a better clientele.  I got one of those deep fryers.  These demons just go crazy for chicken fingers. Look - if they see me dealing with you then I'm just the same old Willy working both sides of the street."
Buffy,I'm going to have to punch you aren't I?
Willow,"Just once and it don't have to hurt, just make it look good."
Willy,Ohhh.  Oww.
Buffy,"Not yet.  I haven't touched you Willy: Sorry right, right, g-go ahead.  Wait.  Willy (loudly): No! I can't talk to you!"
Willy,Ohhh! Owwww!
Buffy,What have you heard about the Polgara?
Willy,Heard there was one around a week or two back.  Word was you got him.  You and those army guys.
Buffy,And that was the last you heard?
Willy,Yeah as far as I know he's off the streets.
Buffy,What about those army guys?  What do you know? You heard anything about 314?
Buffy,What are you doing here?  Following me?
Riley,"You told me you were tracking the Polgara demon, I thought I'd help.  But now I see you're not hunting demons you're socializing with them.  Again!  I thought you were supposed to be killing these things not buying them drinks."
Buffy,"Oh that's smooth, officer Riley.  They teach you those undercover moves in special forces?"
Riley,No I'm serious Buffy.  What are you doing here?
Willy,"Just cooling her dogs like the rest of us.  Why don't you sit down, relax?"
Riley,I want you to tell me.  Who are you?
Willy,No kidding.  How about I get you some chicken fingers on the house?
Riley,Hey think you could shut up!
Willy,Look I'm just saying.
Riley,I said shut up!  Or maybe you'd like to go back to the lab with me.  I'm sure the coats would love to classify a - whatever you are.
Buffy,"Leave him alone Riley, he's human."
Riley,So he's human.
Buffy,You're shaking.
Riley,He just harbors demons.  Which makes him a good guy like you?
Riley,"The truth, Buffy, now!"
Buffy,You have the truth.  You are just screwed up because of what happened to Professor Walsh to see it.  Now let go of me.
Willy,"Hey!  We got new rules here, no killing."
Riley,Right. Except rules don't seem to apply much these days do they?  Like if I shot you right now I don't know if I'd have a corpse on my hands or one pissed off vampire.
Buffy,Riley.
Riley,"I mean who do you believe?  First it sounds like lies, then it sounds like truth. Buffy (softly): Riley."
Riley,Oh what's happening to me?
Buffy,Riley why don't you lie down?  You'll be more comfortable.
Buffy,Stop it.
Riley,I can't.  It's like something's growing inside of me.
Buffy,No.  You're hurting yourself.  Ok shhh.
Riley,"I thought I knew, but I don't.  I don't know anything."
Riley,No.  Buffy.  I don't know... anything.  I don't know what's going on.  Who the bad guys are.  Maybe I'm the bad guy.  Maybe I'm the thing you should kill.
Buffy,No! Don't you even think that.
Giles,How is he?
Buffy,It isn't just grief making him act this way.  Something's affecting him physically and its getting worse.
Anya,{Do} you think Professor Walsh did something to him?
Buffy,"I don't know, but I'm ready to find out."
Xander,"That's gonna be tough, what with Maggie's deadness and all."
Buffy,"She must have kept records somewhere.  A-about Riley, about 314, about all of it.  And I'm sure she wasn't the only person that knew what she was up to."
Xander,So what's the plan?
Buffy,"Giles, Anya keep researching.  Xander, you and I are going undercover."
Anya,Hey!  Remember before.  No Xander!  Not in a boyfriend way or a lead him to a certain death way.
Buffy,He's the only one with military experience.
Anya,It's not like he was in the 'Nam.  He was GI Joe for one night.
Xander,It's ok Anya.  I've backed up Buffy before.
Anya,Can't you do something else to help them?  Like... Xerox handouts or something?
Xander,I'll be careful.  Promise.
Giles,"It's a minor point but how do you plan to get in to the Initiative?  I sure their, uh, security system's almost impenetrable."
Buffy,I have my clearance.  I'm hoping she didn't have time to revoke it.
Giles,{Ok}.  As to the whereabouts of this Polgara demon... I'm afraid we've-we've not turned up much.  There's been no reports since its original capture.
Buffy,Then we'll just have to keep looking.
Tara,So the square is Sunnydale.
Willow,Right it's like a map.  We both take different parts of the potion and when we do the incantation we both blow it onto the square at the exact same time.
Tara,But hown does it work?
Willow,Well that's the cool part.  When the potion mixes and Thespia is called it creates this mist over the parts where the demons are. I-It even makes different colors for different breeds.
Tara,Wow. Tara nodds.
Willow,You ready?
Willow,Let's do it.
Tara,"Thespia, we walk in shadow, walk in blindness.  You are the protector of the night."
Willow,"Thespia, goddess, ruler of all darkness, we implore you, open a window to the world of the underbeing."
Willow,With your knowledge may we go in safety.  With your grace may we speak of your benevolence.
Willow,Or not.
Xander,Seems pretty quite.
Buffy,It usually is this time of _
Xander,"Buff, maybe You should check the look later."
Buffy,Shhh.
Xander,Oww! What'd you do that for?
Buffy,"Sorry, I'm the only one that can pass the retinal scan."
Xander,The. Ewww.  I don't wanna see that.
Buffy,Retinal.  Scan.  Xander.
Buffy,Well we'll know in a few seconds if my clearance is still good.
Xander,Or if we're about to die at the hands of fifty grief filled military goons.
Voice,"Retinal scan recorded. Summers, Buffy."
Xander,Why am I not entirely comforted by the arrival of the man-sized microwave?
Xander,Holy moley.  Buffy: I know.
Buffy,"Wait, what are you talking about?"
Xander,"Well I uh, you know.  In the movies the guy and the girl have to hide."
Buffy,This is the Initiative Xander.  Military guys and scientists do not make out with each other.
Xander,Well maybe that's wrong with the world. Ever think about that?
Willow,It totally failed.  It wasn't even like the spell went wrong. It just wouldn't.
Giles,"If it's any consolation, we haven't fared much better here."
Willow,Really.  Is Riley ok?
Giles,"Well he's asleep finally. {But} he doesn't look good.  And the, uh, research is troubling as well.  I mean, this-this demon we're after seems highly atypical for a Polgara.  This child that it killed is mutilated.  There's no recorded cases of a Polgara ever having done such a thing."
Anya,Also the Polgara have to eat every two hours.  Factor in the low I.Q. and you have a demon who's not exactly low profile.
Willow,So how had he been hiding in Sunnydale for the last two days without anyone seeing him?
Giles,Exactly.
Willow,Riley!
Riley,Where's Buffy?
Willow,She went out.  Can-can I get you something?
Riley,Just tell me where she is.
Giles,You're not well Riley you need to rest.
Riley,Did she find the Polgara?  Hunh?  Is that it?
Giles,"Well, no, we're still looking."
Riley,Well what?
Willow,She went to find out what's making you sick.
Riley,I'm not sick.  Are you're telling me she went to the Initiative.
Willow,Riley she's just trying to help you.
Riley,She doesn't belong there.  Willow: Riley listen/
Riley,Stand away from the stairs.
Willow,"No, you're gonna get Buffy killed."
Giles,You alright?
Engelman,how many of the men are still out the longer they go without their meds
Scientist,Everyone's off their schedules because of the professors' death.
Engleman,It's dangerous I don't want to think about the damage out guys could do under the stress of withdrawal especially since they won't understand what's happening to them.  These guys don't know they've been getting meds in their food so we better get them in here stat
Scientist,we've located all but a few.  the last ones were in pretty bad shape but we stabilized them
Engleman,"but Finn wasn't one of them, right."
Scientist,no
Engleman,Find him.  He's the one I care about.  He's too important to our work to lose now.
Scientist,indeed.
music,I had said it time and time again
spike,"double shot of {{verneg}}, keep.  Make it the good stuff don't want no freaking orangutan"
willy,got ya
Spike,been a real pisser of a day isn't it?  Those army blokes are on a tear.  They ran me out of my place.  And all over town.
Spike,Yeah what's that.
Buffy,Now I don't generally like to kill humans.  But I've learned that it pays to be flexible in life.
Engleman,I was wondering when you'd turn up.
Buffy,Oh darn!  She takes off the glasses.  Buffy: So this isn't a surprise. She sets the glasses down.  Buffy: Now you can tell me what you did to Riley and after that we can take a tour of room 314.
Engleman,"Somebody's coming, you know.  I'm sure they've already seen you on the security monitors."
Riley,"Monitors are non-functional at this time, sir.  Went down about ten minutes ago."
Buffy,What!  I didn't do that.
Xander,"Thank god for small favors and we'll worry about the details later, hunh, Buff?"
Engleman,Finn take this girl to the stockade immediately.
Buffy,"Riley, he can tell us what we need to know.  Maggie wanted me dead, didn't she?"
Engleman,She did.  He looks at Riley Engleman: But understand the Initiative has no interest in eliminating the slayer.  He looks back at Buffy.  Engleman: It was her own vendetta.
Buffy,Why?  Spell it out for me!  I feel an attack of dumb blonde coming on.
Engleman,I don't know.
Buffy,Well think harder!
Engleman,It was the project.
Buffy,Project?  314.
Engleman,It...
Engleman,It escaped.
Riley,That's enough!  You're making her sound like some psychopath. She wasn't like that!  she was a brillant woman!
Engleman,She was.  It's not..
Riley,All she was doing was trying to help people and this is the way you want them to remember her!
Buffy,Engleman said Walsh was feeding you drugs.
Riley,This all started because of you.
Buffy,"If you will just listen to me, I am trying to help you get to the truth."
Riley,"You want truth then tell me, what did you do to her Buffy?"
Buffy,Stop it!  I didn't do anything.
Buffy,"Riley stop! This isn't about us, everything that we need to know is here, we just need to find out what was in 314."
Adam,Me.
Adam,"I've been thinking about the world. I wanted to see it, learn it."
Adam,"I saw the inside of that boy... and it was beautiful, but it didn't tell me about the world.  It just made me feel.  So now I want to learn about me.  Why I feel?  What I am?"
Adam,So I came home.
Adam,"I'm a kinematically redundant, biomechanical demonoid designed by Maggie Walsh.  She called me Adam and I called her mother."
Engleman,Adam.  Maggie would want you to stand down.
Adam,Yes.  But I seem to have a design flaw.
Adam,"In addition to organic material I'm equipped with GP-2, D-11 Infrared Detectors, A Harmonic Decelerator, plus D.C. Servo."
Buffy,She pieced you together from parts of other demons.
Adam,"And man.  And machine.  Which tells me what I am, but not who I am.  Mother wrote things down.  Hard data, but also her feelings. That's how I learned that I have a job here.  And that she loved me."
Riley,She wasn't your mother and she didn't love you!
Xander,Is that really the issue?
Riley,She made you because she was a scientist!
Xander,Riley!
Adam,Riley Finn.
Riley,Stop!  Those files...
Adam,Oh! Mother created you too.
Riley,Maggie's not my mother!  I have a mother!  A real _
Adam,"A birth mother.  Yes.  But after you met Maggie, she was the one who shaped your basic operating system.  She taught you how to think, how to feel.  She fed you chemicals to make you stronger - your mind and body.  She said that you and I were her favorite children.  Her art.  That makes us brothers. Family."
Riley,No!!! I'm not like you.
Adam,That's pain isn't it?  Why?  Because your feeding schedule - the chemicals have been interupted?  Or do you miss her?  Tell me.
Riley,I'll kill you!!!
Adam,You won't.  You haven't been programmed to.
Riley,I cannot be programmed! I'm a man!
Adam,It's here. {He holds a diskette up.}
Adam,The plan she had for us.  What happens.  How it ends.
Riley,No.
Riley,No!!!
Adam,Doctor.
Adam,Thank you.  This has been... very interesting.
Buffy,Riley. Are you ok?
Xander,{We} got a demon in here. It escaped through that vent.
Buffy,It's not the Polgara - it looks sort of half man.
Forrest,Right and you just happened to be in the neighborhood.
Riley,She's telling the truth. I saw it. It killed Engelman. Go.. now.
Buffy,He needs to go to a hospital.
Forrest,We'll take it from here.
Buffy,I'm going with him.
Forrest,It's a military hospital.
Buffy,No.
Xander,Buffy.
Forrest,"""Escort them out."""
Demon,What did you expect spike - a welcome party?
Demon,Word's out - you've been making war on the demon world.
Spike,War?
Demon,With the slayer.  You kill other demons and the rest of us don't hold with that.
Demon,"Still, if I see you around again, I'll be inclined break that code.  Do you understand?"
Willow,No word from Riley?
Buffy,Nothing. The Initiative probably has him locked in some medical ward. {There's} no way I can get near him until I come up with a better plan than just storming in and getting us all shot.
Willow,"Yeah, you might want to work the kinks out of that one."
Buffy,What am I going to do?  He needs me and I can't get near him.
Willow,You'll find a way.
Buffy,It's not like I can spend all of my energy going after the Initiative.  Not while Adam's out there.
Willow,He's really that big of a threat?
Buffy,I could barely fight him.  It's like Maggie designed him to be the ultimate warrior.  He's smart and fast.  He gave the commando guys the slip with no problem.
Willow,There's gotta be a flaw.
Buffy,I think the part where he's pure evil and kills randomly was an oversight
Buffy,I never should have let them take Riley.  I need to be with him.
Willow,I'm sure he's ok.
Buffy,There's no way he can be.  Everything's he's ever believed in has been taken away.  He's alone.  He has nothing to hold on to.

Buffy,"So Maggie sends me down into the sewers with one of those Blasto-guns.  And the next thing I know, it's raining monsters."
Xander,(without humor) Hallelujah.
Buffy,"And then this gate slams down behind me and I try to use the gun but it goes ""phitt!"""
Giles,You're saying that Maggie Walsh set you up?
Buffy,That's exactly what I'm saying.  She sent me on a way-one recon.
Spike,"Gotta hand it to you, Goldilocks.  You do have bleeding, tragic taste in men.  I got a cousin married to a regurgitating Frovalox demon that's got better instincts than you."
Buffy,(glaring at him) What does my taste in men have to do with this?
Spike,Do you think Riley was out knitting booties for your future off-spring while Maggie was stringing you up?
Buffy,You guys think Riley had something to do with this?
Giles,"Probably not.  But, uh . . . we'd be remiss if we didn't think of all the possibilities."
Buffy,"(softly) Right.  ""Remiss."""
Buffy,"No.  No.  Maggie made sure he was no where around when she sent me on this very special ""make Buffy dead"" assignment."
Willow,"And plus, Riley?  He seems like he wouldn't tell a little white lie, let alone a whole bunch of big, dirty ones."
Xander,"That's why they call it the ""secret forces,"" Will.  'Cause they kinda keep the whole lying thing to themselves."
Buffy,All I know is that Maggie has it in for me.  Which means the Initiative has it in for me.
Xander,I'm guessing the mad scientist isn't too keen on the fact that the entire Scooby Gang knows that the Initiative is up to no good.
Buffy,"Which brings us back to the ""not safe for any of us"" concept."
Giles,What could have happened to make Professor Walsh want to kill you?
Buffy,"(at a loss) I don't know.  Uh . . . She wasn't keen on the fact that I was asking a lot of questions, that's for sure."
Anya,So you were getting too close to something?
Giles,"Clearly.  Although, one can only imagine what she'd be so desperate to hide."
Buffy,"Okay, everybody grab a weapon.  We gotta move."
Xander,"And storm the Initiative? (bravado) Yeah, let's take on those suckers!"
Buffy,I was thinking more that we'd hide.
Xander,"(relieved) Oh, thank God."
Giles,"Buffy, I think perhaps we should talk about this."
Buffy,We need to relocate some place where we're less likely to be found.  We need to come up with a plan.
Willow,We could go to my place. (she is holding a wicked looking flail = think spiked mace on a chain)
Buffy,"The Initiative guys know how close we are.  They'll automatically check the places you hang out.  Xander, what about your basement.  The guys haven't seen us together that much and there's enough room."
Willow,"(smiles) Oh, plus: mirror ball."
Xander,Cool!  Come on down and boogie at Xander's hideaway.
Anya,(not happy) Yes.  Come boogie.
Giles,Absolutely not.  I will not squat in that dank whole.
Spike,What?  It was good enough for me but you're above it all?
Giles,"Precisely. (sits down at his desk) Besides, I don't see why we can't stay right where we are. (chuckles) Because it's very unlikely those Initiative boys are gonna come around here looking for--"
Riley,Buffy!
Riley,"God, Buffy.  Are you okay?  What happened?"
Buffy,(a beat) You know?
Riley,I know something went down. (pause) Tell me.
Buffy,Maggie tried to kill me.
Anya,"(helpfully) It didn't work, but they're all upset anyway."
Riley,"Okay, listen.  I need you to go over everything.  Step by step. There has-- has to be some kind of mistake."
Xander,There was no mistake!  And how do you know something happened?
Riley,"I was on a mission.  But I came back and . . . I'm not sure. Look, let's just keep our heads and not jump to any--"
Buffy,What?
Riley,That's Hostile 17.
Spike,"Uh, no!  I'm (bad American accent) just a friend of Xanderrr's-- (sighs) Bugger it.  I'm your guy."
Buffy,"This is Spike.  He's, uh . . . It's a really long story.  But he's not bad anymore."
Spike,"Hey! (stands) What I am, a bleeding broken record?  I'm bad! It's just . . . I can't bite anymore.  Thanks to you wankers."
Riley,(exasperated) We've been looking all over the place for him but you've known where he's been all along?
Buffy,It's not like that.
Riley,Then what is it like?  What's he doing here?
Spike,Leaving you swabs to your dramatics.  Thanks.
Spike,"(putting it on) I've got my stories on the telly for that.  By the by, if you're trying to kill her . . ."
Riley,Buffy . . . what is this?  You're hiding an HST?
Xander,"Why don't you just back off and let her ask the questions, Jack?  Your boss just tried to make monster food out of her."
Riley,I-I didn't see much.  I wasn't there.  I . . . All I know is Professor Walsh told me you were dead.  But then I saw you on the monitors . . . Look this isn't Professor Walsh-- There must be something making her act this way.  Something I-- I don't know. Controlling her.
Giles,We think Buffy may have been becoming too in inquisitive.  That she was getting close to something that Professor Walsh was trying to hide.  Any idea what that might be?
Buffy,What about 314?  Maybe that's it?
Riley,Maybe she was trying to test you.  What if it was only a drill?
Buffy,"Then why did she tell you I was dead?  Riley, it wasn't a test."
Giles,"See, I've heard rumors that the Initiative wasn't all that we've been told.  That, uh, secretly they're working towards some darker purpose.  Something that might harm us all--"
Riley,No!  That's . . . that's not what happens there.
Buffy,Riley.
Riley,I would know!
Buffy,"Look, no one is sure of anything.  Okay?  We're just trying to sort it out."
Riley,I can't be here.  I'll sort it out on my own. (heads for the door)
Buffy,(going after him) Riley.
Riley,No!  Just-- I'm sorry.
ADAM,What am I?
Boy,(standing) You're a monster.
ADAM,(nodding) I thought so.  What are you?
Boy,Me?  I'm a boy.
ADAM,(curious) A boy.  How do you work?
Boy,"I don't know, I just do."
Boy,What's that for?
Angleman,Dr. Walsh? (worried whisper) Adam?
Buffy,(unmoved) That would never happen.
Willow,"Well, no, Buff.  That's why they call them cartoons not documentaries."
Giles,Must we have the noise?  My head is splitting.
Willow,"(smiling) Well, look who's cranky bear in the morning."
Giles,Yes.  I can't imagine why I didn't sleep well in my beach ball.
Anya,Every time you moved it made squeaky noises.  It was irritating.
Giles,Really?  I'm surprised you could hear it over your Wagnerian snoring.
Buffy,"Okay, you guys, could we not, please.  Everything's screwed up enough without you two doing scenes from my parents' marriage."
Anya,(a beat) Sorry.
Giles,Sorry.
Buffy,Thank you.
Willow,"It'll be okay, Buffy.  Riley's just confused, that's all."
Buffy,I don't know.  It just seems like things can get heavier.  His whole world's falling apart.
Anya,"And after everything you've been through with Angel.  You know, you really should get yourself a boring boyfriend. (smiles) Like Xander. (then) You can't have Xander."
Buffy,"That was the idea.  Riley was supposed to be Mr. Joe Guy.  We were gonna do dumb things like hold hands through the daisies going ""tra la la."""
Willow,Poor Buffy.  Your life resists all things average.
Anya,So dump him! (sternly) But you can't have Xander.
Buffy,"I'll try and remember that. (pause) It's too late, anyway.  I'm already at the ""I hurt when he hurts.  I smile when he smiles"" stage."
Anya,(whispers) I hate that part.
Buffy,I'll just have to make it work.
Xander,Turn on the TV.  Now!
Newswoman,Sunnydale is still reeling from news of the crime. (Giles peeks out from the blankets brushing his teeth) A source in the coroner's office tells us that the boy was stabbed with what looks like some kind of large skewer.  And his body was then mutilated. Police have not named a suspect and the killer is still at large.
Buffy,The Polgara demon had a skewer in its arm.  That's the one Maggie insisted we bring back alive.
Giles,(mouthful of toothpaste) She must have sent it after you.
Buffy,And it got distracted. (looks away) God.
Willow,"Buffy, it's not your fault.  How could you know?"
Giles,She's right.  You mustn't blame yourself.
Buffy,(a beat) I'm not going to.
Buffy,"I'm going to the crime scene to see what I can find out.  You guys research the Polgara demon.  I want to know where it is.  When I find it, I am going to make him pay for taking that kid's life.  I'll make him die in ways he can't even imagine."
Buffy,That probably would have sounded more commanding if I wasn't wearing my yummy sushi pajamas.
Forrest,Hey!  Where you been all night?
Forrest,(smiles) Well.  Congratulations.  I see you and Buffy have finally gotten past the shy phase.
Riley,I wasn't with Buffy.  I needed to be alone.  Think some things through.
Forrest,What things?
Forrest,"(stepping inside) This is mighty ominous.  What's up, man?"
Riley,Professor Walsh tried to have Buffy killed.
Forrest,"What?  Did Buffy tell you that?  I mean, do you have any proof?"
Riley,I saw enough to know it's true.
Forrest,I don't get it.  Why?
Riley,I don't know. (paces across the room) Buffy thinks that she's getting too close to something.  That Professor Walsh has some secret.
Forrest,I wouldn't put it past Buffy to get on Professor Walsh's bad side.  She tends to put her nose where it doesn't belong.
Riley,What?
Forrest,"(angry) She's a pain.  Always wanting to know ""why this?"" and ""why that?"""
Riley,(exasperated) And you're saying she should die because of that?
Forrest,I don't know.  Maybe Professor Walsh found out that Buffy was up to something bad.  That ever cross your mind?
Riley,Why does it bug you so much that I'm hanging with her?  Is it because she's a better soldier than you?
Forrest,It bugs me that she's using you to infiltrate our operations.
Riley,(raising voice) So you're saying she's a spy?  You're crazy! (turns away)
Forrest,"Riley, think about it.  The professor is not stupid.  If she tried to kill Buffy, maybe Buffy needed killing."
Graham,Guys.
Riley,"Not now, Graham."
Forrest,What is it?
Graham,(deep breath) Professor Walsh is dead.
Forrest,"(steely) Look at that wound.  She's been staked, wouldn't you say, brother?"
Riley,What?
Forrest,Only one person I can think of who could do something like that.
Riley,(warning tone) You better not be saying what I think you're saying.
Riley,We-we don't know that a person did this.  The Polgara demon has a skewer that comes right out of--
Forrest,(angrily) No way!  That's your girlfriend's MO!
Riley,"(grabs a fistful of Forrest's shirt) Hey, that's a serious accusation!  You better be ready to deal with the consequences."
Forrest,(shoves Riley back) Then bring `em on!  That supernatural freak has blinded you and I'm sick of it!
Riley,(advancing) That's enough!!
Angleman,"Stand back!  Show some respect!  Listen, everybody's upset. But arguing isn't going to help anything.  And it's certainly not what Professor Walsh would want."
Riley,"No, sir. (takes a couple of steps back)"
Angleman,All right.  Good.  Now Washington is sending in a team to do an internal investigation.  I've been told we have to wait for their word.
Riley,"What do you mean ""wait?""  This has to be the work of the Polgara demon we captured last week!"
Angleman,"Probably.  Looks like, last night, the Polgara escaped through tunnel seventy-two."
Riley,It's out loose somewhere?!  Angleman: I'm afraid so.
Riley,Then we have to go after it.
Angleman,"My orders from Washington are for a total lock-down until they arrive.  I'm sorry.  Now, return to your quarters.  There's nothing you can do here."
Riley,"Listen.  Angleman can talk all he wants, but I'm still in charge until the brass gets here and tells me otherwise.  I say we got a demon to hunt. (absently scratches the back of his right hand) Now suit up for armed patrol.  And by that I mean loaded guns, man. Target practice is over.  We're going for blood."
Forrest,Somebody's been staying here.
Graham,"What do think, a homeless guy?"
Forrest,(moving deeper into the chamber) Could be.  Or a squatter of the demon variety.
Graham,But not the Polgara.
Forrest,"(faces him) Who cares!?  I see a demon, it dies."
Graham,It's warm.
Forrest,Damn.
Forrest,Animals.
Riley,Buffy.
Riley,Hey.
Buffy,"Hey.  Look, I'm sorry about earlier.  I know everyone came on pretty strong.  And the Spike thing isn't as tweaked as it looked. Okay, maybe it is.  But there's an explanation that almost makes sense. (sees that he's looking off to the hills) Hello?  I'm apologizing here.  And I think that's pretty big of me, considering I'm the one who was almost made a demon sandwich."
Buffy,This is the part where you throw me a bone.
Riley,Maggie's dead.
Riley,Happy now?
Buffy,(eyes narrowing) How can you ask me that?  Of course I'm not happy.  What happened?
Riley,(coldly) That's classified.
Buffy,Classifi-- (realizes) The Polgara.  It got her and escaped. Didn't it?
Buffy,I'm gonna find it.  I'm gonna find it and destroy it. (angry) And then you can stop asking me how happy all this death makes me!
Willow,(smiling) Howdy.
Tara,(smiles) I just got your message a minute ago.  I was in class. But I was about to call you.
Willow,I had so much fun the other night.  The spells.
Tara,"Yeah, that was nice."
Willow,"I hope you don't think that I just come over for the spells and everything.  I mean, I really like just talking and hanging out with you and stuff."
Tara,I know that. (knowingly) But you want to do a spell.
Willow,Yeah.  But only because it's really important.  There's this--
Tara,"No.  You don't have to explain.  I don't mind.  Really. (smiles) I've been, um, thinking about that last spell we did all day."
Willow,"(excited) You have?  Well this one should be fun, too.  We conjure the goddess Thespia to help us locate demonic energy in the area.  It shouldn't be too tricky."
Tara,The goddess Thespia?  Are you sure we're ready for that?
Willow,You and me? (gamely) This is beneath us.
Tara,(considers) . . . Okay.  If you say so.
Willy,You're killing me here.
Buffy,"Oh, I missed you, too.  The joint's jumping."
Willy,"Yeah.  You know. (the vampire sitting nearby sees Buffy looking at him and takes his leave, forgetting his beer) Making some changes with my life.  I'm getting away from my old image."
Buffy,You mean as a double-dealing snitch?
Willy,"Uh-huh.  I know you gonna think I'm blowing smoke, but after those apocalypse demons nearly did me in, I had an experience of the spiritual variety."
Buffy,"(not caring) That's swell, really.  But I need to know if you've heard anything about a Polgara demon doing some killings in the last few of days."
Willy,"See, uh, that's the think.  I don't talk behind people's backs no more.  And I'm bringing some class to the joint.  You know?  It's ""Willy's Place"" now.  See? (indicates neon sign on the wall) Brings in a better clientele.  I got one of those deep friers.  These demons just go crazy for chicken fingers.  (off Buffy's expression) Look, if they see me dealing with you, then I'm just the same old Willy working both sides of the street."
Buffy,"I'm gonna have to punch you, aren't I?"
Willy,(not missing a beat) Just once and it don't have to hurt.  Just make it look good.
Willy,Oww!  Oh!
Buffy,"(whispering) Not yet, I haven't touched you!"
Willy,"Oh, sorry.  Right.  Right.  G-go ahead.  Wait.  (louder voice) No.  I can't talk to you--oww!"
Willy,Ohhhh!
Buffy,What have you heard about the Polgara?
Willy,(still in pain) Heard there was one about a week or two back. Word was you got him.  You and those army guys.
Buffy,And that was the last you heard?
Willy,"Yeah.  As far as I know, he's off the streets."
Buffy,What about those army guys?  What do you know?  You heard anything about 314?
Buffy,(faces him) What are you doing here? Following me?
Riley,"(a tad pissed) You told me you were tracking the Polgara demon. I thought I'd help.  But now I see you're not hunting demons, you're socializing with them.  *Again.* I thought you were supposed to be killing these things not buying them drinks?"
Buffy,"(sarcastic) Oh, that's smooth, officer Riley.  They teach you those undercover moves in special forces?"
Riley,"I'm serious, Buffy.  What are you doing here?"
Willy,"Just cooling her dogs, like the rest of us.  Why don't you sit down.  Relax."
Riley,(ignores him) I want you to tell me.  Who are you? (seething) Really?
Willy,"No kidding.  Why don't I get you some chicken fingers, on the house."
Riley,"(to Willy) Hey, you think you can shut up?"
Willy,"Look, I'm just saying--"
Riley,I said shut up!  Or maybe you would like to go back to the lab with me.  I'm sure the coats would love to classify a . . . whatever you are.
Buffy,"Leave him alone, Riley.  He's human."
Riley,So he's human.
Buffy,You're shaking.
Riley,"(looking at Buffy) He just harbors demons.  Which makes him a good guy like you? (grabs her roughly by the shoulders) The truth, Buffy.  Now!"
Buffy,You have the truth.  You are just too screwed up because of what happened to Professor Walsh to see it.  (raises voice) Now let go of me! (knocks his hands off her shoulders)
Riley,Hold it!  You!
Riley,No leaving until I say so.  Got it?
Willy,Hey.  We got new rules here.  No killing.
Riley,(looking over his shoulder) Right!  Except the rules don't seem to apply much these days.  Do they?
Riley,"(to the woman) Like if I shot you right now, I don't know if I'd have a corpse on my hands or one pissed off vampire."
Buffy,Riley--
Riley,"(to Buffy) I mean, who do you believe?  First it sounds like lies.  Then it sounds like truth."
Buffy,Riley. . .
Riley,What's happening to me?
Buffy,"(soft voice) Riley, why don't you lie down?  You'll be more comfortable."
Buffy,Stop it.
Riley,(shaky voice) I can't.  It's like . . . something's growing inside.
Buffy,"No.  You're hurting yourself.  C'mere. (she reaches up and pulls off the red scarf she had wrapped around her hair) Okay, shh. (gently wraps it around his hand)"
Riley,I thought I knew . . . but I don't.  I don't know anything.
Buffy,(soothingly) Shh.  You're sick.  Once you get some rest--
Riley,No.  Buffy.  I don't know . . . anything.  I don't know which team I'm on.  Who the bad guys are. (looks into her eyes) Maybe I'm the bad guy.  Maybe I'm the thing you should kill.
Buffy,"No.  Don't you even think that. (puts a hand on his cheek) Okay, listen to me.  You're sick.  You just need to get some sleep. Please.  Lie down for me.  Come on."
Buffy,(quietly) You're gonna be okay.
Giles,How is he?
Buffy,This isn't just grief making him act this way.  Something's effecting him physically and it's getting worse.
Anya,You think Professor Walsh did something to him?
Buffy,"I don't know, but I'm ready to find out."
Xander,"That's gonna be tough, what with Maggie's deadness and all."
Buffy,"She must have kept records somewhere.  A-about Riley, about 314, about all of it.  And I'm sure she wasn't the only person that knew what she was up to."
Xander,So what's the plan?
Buffy,"Giles, Anya, keep researching.  Xander, you and I are going undercover."
Anya,"Hey! (steps closer to Xander) Remember before?  No Xander!  Not in a ""boyfriend"" way or a ""lead him to a certain death"" way."
Buffy,He's the only one with military experience.
Anya,It's not like he was in the 'Nam.  He was GI Joe for one night.
Xander,"It's okay, Anya.  I've backed up Buffy before."
Anya,(concerned) Can't you do something else to help them?  Like Xerox handouts or something?
Xander,I'll be careful. (puts his hands on her shoulders) Promise.
Giles,It's a minor point but how do you plan to get in to the Initiative?  I'm sure their security system's almost impenetrable.
Buffy,I have my clearance.  I'm hoping she didn't have time to revoke it.
Giles,"Okay.  Well as for the whereabouts of this Polgara demon, I'm afraid we've . . we've not turned up much.  There've been no reports since its original capture."
Buffy,Then we'll just have to keep looking.
Tara,So . . the square is Sunnydale?
Willow,Right.  It's like a map.  We both take different parts of the potion and when we do the incantation we both blow it onto the square at the exact same time.
Tara,But how does it work?
Willow,Well that's the cool part.  When the potion mixes and Thespia's called it creates this mist over the parts where the demons are. I-It even makes different colors for different breeds.
Tara,Wow.
Willow,You ready?
Willow,Let's do it.
Tara,"Thespia, we walk in shadow.  Walk in blindness.  You are the protector of the night."
Willow,"Thespia, goddess, ruler of all darkness, we implore you . . . open a window to the world of the underbeing."
Willow,With your knowledge may we go in safety.  With your grace may we speak of your benevolence.
Willow,Or not.
Xander,Seems pretty quite.
Buffy,It usually is this time of--
Xander,"(stepping up next to her) Buff, maybe you should check the look later."
Buffy,Shh! (she shoves him away none too gently)
Xander,Oww! (surprised and a little hurt) What'd you do that for?
Buffy,Sorry.  I'm the only one that can pass the retinal scan.
Xander,The re-- eww!  I don't wanna see that.
Buffy,"(glares) *Retinal* scan, Xander. (looks into the mirror again) Well, we'll know in a few seconds if my clearance is still good."
Xander,Or if we're about to die at the hands of fifty grief-filled military goons.
Xander,Why am I not entirely comforted by the arrival of the man-sized microwave?
Xander,(awed) Holy moly!
Buffy,I know.
Xander,"I totally get it now.  Can I have sex with Riley, too?"
Xander,(whispers) Quick pretend to make out with me!
Buffy,(whispers) What!?  What are you talking about? (pushes away)
Xander,"(whispers) Well, I, uh, you know, in the movies, the guy and the girl have to hide."
Buffy,(whispers) Please!  Could you possibly draw more attention to us?
Buffy,"(whispers) This is the Initiative, Xander.  Military guys and scientists do not make out with each other."
Xander,(whispers) Well maybe that's what's wrong with the world. Ever think about that?
Willow,It totally failed.  It wasn't even like the spell went wrong. It just . . . wouldn't.
Giles,"If it's any consolation, we haven't fared much better here."
Willow,Really.  Is Riley okay?
Giles,"Well, h-he's asleep.  Finally.  But he doesn't look good. (hands Anya a cup) And the, uh, research is troubling as well. I mean, this-this demon we're after seems highly atypical for a Polgara.  This child that it killed . . was mutilated.  There's no recorded cases of a Polgara ever having done such a thing."
Anya,(fidgeting with the string of her tea bag) Also the Polgara have to eat every two hours.  Factor in the low IQ and you have a demon who's not exactly low profile.
Willow,So how has he been hiding out in Sunnydale for the last two days without anyone seeing him?
Giles,Exactly.
Willow,(surprised) Riley.
Riley,(agitated) Where's Buffy?
Willow,She went out.  Can-can I get you something?
Riley,Just tell me where she is.
Giles,"You're not well, Riley.  Y-you need to rest."
Riley,"Did she find the Polgara? (stands, rubbing his arm as if cold) Huh?  Is that it?"
Giles,"Well, no, we're still looking.  But--"
Riley,But what?
Willow,She went to find out what's making you sick.
Riley,(sharply) I'm not sick! (more agitated) You're telling me she went to the Initiative?!
Willow,"Riley, she's just trying to help you."
Riley,(crosses the basement to grab his gear) She doesn't belong there.
Willow,"Riley, listen--"
Riley,Stand away from the stairs.
Willow,No!  You're gonna get Buffy killed--
Giles,Hey!
Giles,You all right?
Angleman,How many of the men are still out?   They return to the corner and try to look inconspicuous as Dr. Angleman enters the corridor with another scientist.  They eavesdrop.   Angleman: The longer they go without their meds . . .
Angleman,"It's dangerous.  I don't want to think about the damage our guys could do under the stress of withdrawal.  Especially since they won't understand what's happening to them.  These guys don't know they've been getting meds in their food, so we better get them in here STAT."
Angleman,"But Finn wasn't one of them, right?"
Angleman,Find him.  He's the one I care about.  He's too important to the work to lose now.
Spike,"Double-shot of O-neg, 'keep.  And make it the good stuff.  I don't want no freaking orangutan. (puts a few dollars on the bar)"
Willy,Got ya.
Spike,"(as drink is being poured) Been a pisser of a day, isn't it? Those army blokes are on a tear.  They ran me outta my place.  And all over town."
Spike,"Yeah, what's that?"
Angleman,Keep me posted.  I'll be in records
Buffy,"(pissed) Now I don't generally like to kill humans, but I've learned that it pays to be flexible in life."
Angleman,I was wondering when you'd turn up.
Buffy,(mock disappointment) Oh darn! (takes off her glasses) So this isn't a surprise?  Now you can tell me what you did to Riley and after that we can take a tour of room 314.
Angleman,"Somebody's coming, you know?  I'm sure they've already seen you on the security monitors."
Riley,"(stepping from around a the corner) Monitors are non-functional at this time, sir.  Went down about ten minutes ago."
Buffy,(looks to Xander) What?  I didn't do that.
Xander,"Thank god for small favors and we'll worry about details later, huh, Buff?"
Angleman,Finn take this girl to the stockade immediately.
Buffy,"Riley, he can tell us what we need to know. (to Angleman) Maggie wanted me dead, didn't she?"
Angleman,(a beat) She did. (to Riley) But understand the Initiative has no interest in eliminating the Slayer.  It was her own vendetta.
Buffy,"Why?  Spell it out for me.  I feel an attack of ""dumb blonde"" coming on."
Angleman,I don't know.
Buffy,(jerks him closer) Well.  Think.  Harder.
Angleman,It was . . . the project.
Buffy,Project?  314.
Angleman,It . . .
Angleman,(to Buffy) It escaped.
Riley,(stepping closer) That's enough!  You're making her sound like some psychopath.  She wasn't like that!  She was a brilliant woman!
Angleman,She was.  I--it's not--
Riley,(angry) All she was doing was trying to help people . . . and this is the way you want them to remember her?!
Buffy,(to Riley) Angleman said Walsh was feeding you drugs.
Riley,"You're doing this to me, aren't you?"
Riley,(glaring) This all started because of you!
Buffy,"Look, if you will just listen to me, okay?  I am trying to help you get to the truth."
Riley,"You want truth?  Then tell me . . . (grabs her arm) what did you do to her, Buffy?"
Buffy,(breaks the hold) Stop it!  I didn't do anything!
Buffy,"Riley, stop! This isn't about us!  Everything that we need to know is here.  We just need to find out what was in 314."
ADAM,Me.
ADAM,I've been thinking about the world.  I wanted to see it.  Learn it.  I saw the inside of that boy and it was beautiful.  But it didn't tell me about the world.  It just made me feel.  So now . . . I want to learn about me.  Why I feel?  What I am?
ADAM,So I came home.
ADAM,"(pacing again) I'm a kinematically redundant, biomechanical demonoid.  Designed by Maggie Walsh.  She called me Adam and I called her mother."
Angleman,Adam.  Maggie would want you to stand down.
ADAM,(looks at him) Yes.  But I seem to have a design flaw.
ADAM,"(pacing) In addition to organic material, I'm equipped with GP-2/D-11 Infrared Detectors.  A Harmonic Decelerator, plus DC Servo."
Buffy,She pieced you together from parts of other demons.
ADAM,"And man.  And machine.  Which tells me what I am . . but not who I am.  Mother wrote things down.  Hard data, but also her feelings. That's how I learned that I have a job here.  And that she loved me."
Riley,She wasn't your mother!  And she didn't love you!
Xander,(not taking eyes off Adam) Is that really the issue?
Riley,She made you because she was a scientist!
Xander,(warningly) Rileeey.
ADAM,Riley Finn.
Riley,Stop!  Those files--
ADAM,"Oh!  Mother created you, too."
Riley,Maggie is not my mother! (to Buffy) I have a mother!  A real--
ADAM,"A birth mother.  Yes.  But after you met Maggie, she was the one who shaped your basic operating system.  She taught you how to think. How to feel.  She fed you chemicals to make you stronger.  Your mind and body.  She said that you and I were her favorite children.  Her art.  That makes us brothers.  Family."
Riley,No! (taking a step forward) I'm not like you!
ADAM,"That's pain, isn't it?  Why?  Because your feeding schedule --the chemicals-- have been interrupted?  Or do you miss her?  Tell me."
Riley,I'll kill you!
ADAM,(calmly) You won't.  You haven't been programmed to.
Riley,I cannot be programmed! I'm a man!
ADAM,It's here.
ADAM,The plan she had for us.  What happens.  How it ends.
Riley,(quietly) No.
ADAM,Do you want to hear?
Riley,No!
ADAM,Doctor.
ADAM,Thank you.  This has been . . . very interesting.
Commando,(OS) Back away from the door!
Buffy,Riley.  Are you okay?
Commando,(OS) Secure the room!  Go! Go!
Xander,(still on the floor) We got a demon in here.  It escaped through that vent.
Buffy,It's not the Polgara.  It looks sort of half man.
Forrest,Right!  And you just happened to be in the neighborhood.
Riley,(painfilled) She's telling the truth.  I saw it.  It killed Angleman.  Go.  Now!
Commando,"Yes, sir."
Buffy,He needs to go to a hospital.
Forrest,We'll take it from here.
Buffy,I'm going with him.
Forrest,It's a military hospital.
Buffy,No.
Forrest,"Back off! We take care of our own around here, understand?"
Xander,(concerned) Buffy.
Forrest,(to commandos) Escort them out.
Riley,(weakly) Buffy
Spike,(dazed) War?
Willow,No word from Riley?
Buffy,Nothing. The Initiative probably has him locked in some medical ward. There's no way I can get near him until I come up with a better plan than just storming in and getting us all shot.
Willow,"Yeah, you might want to work the kinks out of that one."
Buffy,What am I going to do?  He needs me and I can't get near him.
Willow,You'll find a way.
Buffy,It's not like I can spend all of my energy going after the Initiative.  Not while Adam's out there.
Willow,He's really that big of a threat?
Buffy,(sighs) I could barely fight him.  I-it was like Maggie designed him to be the ultimate warrior.  He's smart and fast.  He gave the commando guys the slip with no problem.
Willow,There's gotta be a flaw.
Buffy,I think the part where he's pure evil and kills randomly was an oversight.
Buffy,I never should have let them take Riley.  I need to be with him.
Willow,I'm sure he's okay.
Buffy,There's no way he can be.  Everything he's ever believed in has been taken away or . . .  He's alone.  He has nothing to hold on to.
