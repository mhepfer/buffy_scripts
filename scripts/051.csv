Buffy,Well.
Angel,Well.
Buffy,That was very ... artistic.
Angel,Yeah.
Buffy,"Wasn't what I expected. I've never actually seen... Well,
 from the title I thought it was about food."
Angel,Well there was food.
Buffy,"Right. The, the scene with the, the food. So, feel like
 getting some hot chocolate? Or some cold shower?"
Angel,"I'm sorry. I wanted to take you out somewhere fun. It's been
 a long time since I've been to the movies. They changed."
Buffy,"A little scary. And a little not, which is also scary. I'm
 sorry. I just, I don't like getting you worked up like that.
 We can't actually do any of those things. You'd lose your soul.
 Besides, I don't even own a kimono."
Angel,"Buffy, you don't have to worry about me."
Buffy,"Just don't like to rub your nose in it. Suddenly wondering
 where that expression comes from."
Angel,"Look, I don't need to see movies to get worked up. Just being
 around you does that just fine. Doesn't mean that I'm gonna lose
 control, that I'm going to be frustrated around you. It feels nice,
 just to feel."
Buffy,"It doesn't drive you crazy, when we're close?"
Angel,Watch this. (long kiss) See? Safe as houses. (more kisses)
Faith,Check out the lust bunnies.
Buffy,Patrol?
Angel,Council has you back on active duty?
Faith,Finally. They want us down by Mercer.
Buffy,Okay. (to Angel) Goodnight.
Angel,I'll see you soon.
Faith,"Don't worry, big guy. Just keeping her warm for you."
Faith,"Gotta tell you, B. The willpower thing, nice job."
Buffy,Thanks.
Faith,"But, the close but no cigar thing with Angel. I don't know
 if I could handle, you know, the way you're not handling it."
Buffy,"Faith, when it comes to Angel, do me a favor. Duck!"
Demon,"Ow! Ooh! What are you, nuts? Going around punching
 people?"
Buffy,People?
Demon,"So what, I'm a demon. That makes it okay?"
Demon,"Hold it, whoa! Stake me now, and you never find out what I
 got for ya, huh? Think about it. Demon seeks Slayers, highly unusual?"
Faith,Talk fast.
Demon,"How would you like to get your hands on the Books of
 Ascension?"
Buffy,Never heard of 'em.
Demon,"Books of Ascension. Very powerful works and I'm not talking
 about the prose. They deal with some, ah, dark stuff. And the Mayor
 (Faith frowns) would hate for somebody to get ahold before he, ah,
 well you know."
Buffy,Don't know. Before he what?
Demon,"Hey, hey, read 'em and weep. That's all I got to say.
 Tomorrow, I get the books. Meet me here and if the price is right,
 well I give the books to you."
Buffy,Not really looking to trade with a demon.
Demon,"And if this were still a barter economy, that would be a
 problem. I want cash, princess, five large for the whole set."
Faith,"So you can buy, I'm guessing here, some skin care products."
Demon,"Plane ticket. Out of the Hellmouth before its adios, Slayer
 Loco. So, five G's, what do you say?"
Faith,"I think ""Die Fiend"" sums it up, wouldn't you say."
Buffy,"Oh, let him go. I don't think he falls into the deadly threat
 to humanity category."
Faith,A demon's a demon.
Buffy,"I'd like to know about these Books of Ascension. Anything that
 would pin the Mayor down would be great."
Faith,Yeah. It'd be great.
Mayor,And what exactly did this demon look like?
Faith,Demonic?
Mayor,"Ah. And you say he has the Books of Ascension, or will soon,
 and he was, what, willing to sell them?"
Faith,That's what I said.
Mayor,"Hmm. You know what I wish? I wish you'd pull your hair back.
 I know, I know, fashion's not exactly my thing, but, gosh darn
 it, you know, you've got such a nice face. I can't understand
 why you hide it."
Faith,"Yeah, sure. Whatever. It's just a matter of time before this
 demon guy is gonna spill. Then Buffy and the superfriends are
 gonna..."
Mayor,"You know, you worry too much for a girl for your age. That's
 unnecessary stress. Luckily, I've got just the thing."
Mayor,"There you go. Now, first you load up on calcium. Then find
 this demon, kill the heck out of him, and bring the books to me."
Faith,And if Buffy gets to him first?
Mayor,"Oh, well. Frankly I don't like to think about that. I like
 good, positive, up thoughts. If you fail me in that way. Well, you
 know, replacing Mr. Trick was chore enough. (chuckles) Oh, come on,
 don't worry. Drink up. There's nothing uncool about healty teeth
 and bones."
Wesley,And you say this demon wanted cash? That's very unusual.
Giles,"Demons after money. Whatever happened to the still beating
 heart of a virgin? No one has any standards anymore."
Buffy,"Well, he said the books were worth the price."
Xander,What's this Ascenscion mean?
Giles,I'm not sure.
Wesley,"No, not really a common term in demonology."
Willow,"Ooh ooh! The Marenschadt Text. I think in the section on
 genocide, they mention Ascenscion."
Buffy,"Well, we have a winner."
Xander,"And, more importantly, two losers."
Giles,Where did you find that volume?
Willow,"In the top of your book cabinet with the stuff you try to
 keep hidden."
Xander,"Hidden? Are there any engravings I should know about?
 Uh, frolicking nymphs of some kind?"
Willow,No. Just magic secrets Giles doesn't think I'm ready for.
Giles,"Ah, yes, yes, here we are. There's a reference here to the
 journal of Desmond Kane, pastor of a town called Sharpsville.
 ""May 26, 1723. Tomorrow is the Ascenscion. God help us all.""
 It was the last anyone heard."
Wesley,Of Kane?
Giles,Of Sharpsville. The town more or less disappeared.
Buffy,So Ascenscion possibly not a love-in.
Giles,"I think you should meet with this demon, Buffy."
Buffy,Yeah? Anybody got five thousand dollars?
Cordelia,I have something important to ask you.
Xander,"Important? Let's start calculating those odds, people."
Cordelia,What are you doing Friday night?
Wesley,"Uh, I, uh, as always my sacred duty as a Watcher prevents
 me from, ah... Why?"
Cordelia,"I have a paper to write for English and you're English, so
 I thought ... (sees the looks from Buffy and Xander) What? Is it
 so wrong to be getting an insider's perspective? (to Wesley) I
 study best in a good restaurant, around eightish? Think it over?"
Xander,"And on the day the words ""flimsy excuse"" were redefined, we
 stood in awe and watched."
Wesley,"Right! Books of Ascenscion, Mayor, slaughter. Tell you what.
 Why don't we try to find this demon sooner rather than later?
 Perhaps persuade him to lend us the books free of charge."
Buffy,I think Faith might be useful in that persuasion part.
Wesley,I imagine so. Where is Faith anyway?
Demon,"Hey, Slayer! You know, I wasn't expecting company. Give me
 a minute and I'll have the place tidied up for you."
Faith,You got the books?
Demon,"Well, that depends. You got my money?"
Demon,"You're tough in negotiations and I respect that. Check 'em
 out. Now ah, that is quality merchandise. That's worth five grand
 easy."
Faith,Books of Ascenscion.
Demon,"Mm hmm. Original editions and everything. Uh, great
 condition. Okay, it's a little worn on one spine, some slight
 foxing, but otherwise, perfect. Now, the five grand, it's ah, you
 know, negotiable."
Faith,I don't like to haggle.
Angel,Faith.
Faith,"Angel. I got nowhere else to go. Look, I hate asking for help,
 but I'm asking, cause, uh, I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. The real
 bad kind."
Angel,It's okay.
Faith,"No, it's a couple of county lines over from okay, believe me."
Angel,"Look, just talk. Come on. Start from the beginning."
Faith,"Mind if I skip past the 'mom never loved me' part and get right
 to it? I'm scaring myself."
Angel,I know the feeling.
Faith,"That's why I came to you. I don't want to get all twelve
 steppy, but remember when you told me that killing people would
 make me feel like some kind of god? (shows him her bloody hands)
 I think I just came down to earth. It's not human if that's what
 you're thinking. Not that that makes me feel any better or this
 guy any less dead."
Angel,"Faith, you need help. You can't do this alone."
Faith,"I know. For real now, I'm scared. Scared of what I am, what
 I'm turning into. Cold-blooded straight up killer. Like you."
Angel,"Not like me. I didn't have a choice. But you do. You can stop
 this."
Faith,"Believe me, I don't want to end up the way everybody said I
 would, dead or alone or a loser."
Angel,"No, you don't have to."
Faith,I don't know. Maybe it's too late for me.
Angel,It's not.
Faith,"Angel, I'm so scared. (hugs him)"
Angel,"It's alright, shh, it's okay."
Angel,"Whoa. Faith, I, look, I can be here for you. But not like that,
 alright? I'm with Buffy."
Faith,"Buffy, yeah. I didn't mean it like that. Maybe I did, but I
 wouldn't press it. You love her, don't you."
Angel,I love her.
Faith,"Good for you. The two of you, you're lucky. Friends?"
Angel,"Yeah, we're friends."
Faith,Then I'm lucky too. I'd better go.
Angel,Where?
Faith,"I need to cool down. Spend some time alone. Don't worry about
 me. You've been a big help. Just knowing somebody cares. Hey, I know
 I shouldn't be asking this, but do you think if things were different
 that things between you and me would be different, too?"
Angel,We'll never know.
Faith,Right. How could we?
Angel,Take care of yourself.
Faith,Lifetime of practice.
Faith,"It's not like I wasn't trying, okay?"
Mayor,"Hey, there's no need to convince me. I'm sure you gave it your
 level best. I just don't understand what that boy could be thinking?"
Faith,"Try Buffy Summers, like in a big, fat, one track way."
Mayor,"Hey, come on, don't be discouraged. You're a bright, young,
 energetic girl with a whole life ahead of her. And I won't tolerate
 brooding. So you couldn't give him that one moment of true happiness."
Faith,"I was thinking more along the lines of a long weekend, but
 okay."
Mayor,"And he spurns your advances. So be it. There's more than one
 way to skin a cat. And I happen to know that's factually true. We
 want to take Angel's soul away. If we can't do it by giving him
 happiness, well, by golly, we'll just have to do it in the most
 painful way imaginable."
Wesley,Find anything?
Giles,"Six course banquet of nothing with a scoop of sod-all as a
 palate closer."
Wesley,"I've had no better luck. There must be something about this
 Ascescion somewhere."
Giles,"Perhaps I should contact the Council, maybe run a search..."
Wesley,"No. I don't, uh, it should be I that ... The Council isn't
 entirely aware that I'm letting you work for me (off Giles's
 look) um, with me. I don't think they'd be very happy at the idea
 of the two of us collaborating."
Giles,"Well I wasn't about to burst into glorious song about it
 myself. Why don't you call?"
Wesley,"I think the most expedient plan would be to find these Books
 of Ascenscion themselves. Buffy, you and Faith must find this demon,
 and soon."
Buffy,"Well, I'll go back to the scene, see if I can track him."
Wesley,Wait for Faith.
Buffy,"That could be hours. The girl makes Godot look punctual. I'll
 just go myself."
Wesley,"Buffy, this is a job for the both of you. This demon could
 be anywhere."
Wesley,"If these books are important as he says, he has good reason
 to hide. (Xander enters) Finding him is going to be extremely
 difficult."
Xander,Found your demon.
Buffy,"Fashion tip, Wes. Mouth looks better closed."
Xander,"Got the address. (hands Buffy a slip of paper) I beat it out
 of Willy the snitch personally."
Buffy,You beat up Willy?
Xander,"Sure! Well, actually, let's just say I applied some pressure.
 Or more accurately, that I asked politely, and then, uh, okay, I
 bribed him."
Buffy,How much?
Xander,"Twenty-eight bucks. (to Giles) Does the Council reimburse for
 that kind of stuff?"
Giles,Did you get a receipt?
Xander,Damn.
Buffy,"I know this. It's down by the bus station. Not the nicest part
 of town."
Giles,"Again. See, no standards. I mean, any self-respecting demon
 should be living in a pit of filth or a nice crypt."
Buffy,I'll remember to mention that.
Faith,"Mention what? Where we going, girlfriend?"
Buffy,"(pulls her arm away from Faith) Actually, I can handle this
 one solo."
Faith,"Why should you get to have all the fun? Share, share, that's
 fair, right?"
Buffy,Right. Got our demon.
Faith,"Oh, well, let's go look him up."
Xander,Is it me or did it just get really cold in here?
Buffy,"Faith, careful."
Faith,Right.
Buffy,Missed you last night.
Faith,"Yeah, I was patrolling. No shortage of scum you gotta watch
 in Sunnydale, right?"
Buffy,So I've heard.
Buffy,Looks like somebody got here first.
Faith,"Betting they got the books, too. Some hit."
Buffy,This wasn't just a hit. This was somebody's idea of a party.
Faith,"Maybe the guy put up a fight. We gotta get going. Come on,
 nothing we can do here now. You coming?"
Mayor,"Mint? Didn't think so. Well, scheduling a man of your talents
 is quite the chore, I'll tell you. Between the chanting and the
 sacrifice, oh, my golf game is shot. But heeere you are. You know
 why I've summoned you. Can you do it? (Mage nods) Need anything from
 me? (Mage shakes his head)"
Mage,"You have risked great danger in calling on me. The deadliest
 magics are needed to rob this creature of its soul."
Mayor,Big job alright.
Mage,And so it shall be done.
Mayor,"Oh, that's just swell. Listen, you sure you don't want any?
 Cause they're, they're low calorie. Okay."
Willow,"Are you okay? You seem a little on edge. Is there anything
 that's wrong?"
Buffy,"It's nothing. (Willow looks) It's nothing. (Willow looks)
 Alright, alright, stop with the third degree. It's Faith."
Willow,What about her?
Buffy,"I went to Angel's last night and Faith was there. They looked
 sort of intimate."
Willow,No way. I know what you're thinking and no way!
Buffy,You're right. Faith would never do that.
Willow,"Faith would totally do that. Faith was built to do that.
 She's the do that girl."
Buffy,"Comfort, remember comfort, here?"
Willow,"I mean, please, does Angel come up to Faith's standards for
 a guy? Let's see, is he breathing?"
Buffy,"Actually, no."
Willow,"But Buffy, Angel. There's no way he would ever do that.
 I mean, you're the only thing in the world to him."
Buffy,"Sometimes I wonder. Angel and Faith have a lot in common.
 And there's so much he doesn't tell me."
Willow,"But it's so clear the way he feels about you. Buffy, I too
 know the love of a taciturn man and you have to look at their
 actions."
Buffy,I was.
Willow,"Well, what did he say?"
Buffy,"Say? You mean when I straightforwardly asked him what was
 going on?"
Willow,So you bailed?
Buffy,"I couldn't. I mean, not ..."
Willow,Enough. Stop with the crazy. Go talk to Angel.
Buffy,But I ...
Willow,No. Go. I give you leave to go. (points her finger away)
Buffy,Thank you.
Angel,Faith.
Faith,Hey. Sorry to bust in uninvited.
Angel,What do you want.
Faith,"Look, I'm not so good at apologies. Mostly because I think
 the world's out to screw me so I'm generally more owed than
 owing. But I've been thinking about last night and I want you
 to know I was really sorry."
Angel,"It's alright, Faith."
Faith,"No, it's not alright. Yeah, I was freaked and needed somebody,
 but you're with Buffy. I should know better."
Angel,"Yeah, okay."
Faith,You don't trust me.
Angel,It's not that.
Faith,"Hey, no problem. Join the club."
Angel,"Look, Faith. I know what you're going through, alright, and
 how hard it can be. It's important you have somebody who's been
 there and who understands what you're going through. (He grasps
 Faith by the shoulders and turns her around.) Look, I want to
 trust you."
Faith,Chump.
Angel,Faith!
Faith,"I wanted to do this the old-fashioned way, but hey, your
 loss. Lucky I've got some tricks Buffy don't know yet."
Angel,You don't have to do this.
Faith,"I know, but it's fun. Now relax, it'll be over soon."
Angel,"Thanks, so much. (slaps Faith away) It's good to have the
 taste of a Slayer back in my mouth. It's like cigarettes,
 you know, just when I thought I'd quit. (kicks Faith in the
 side) No, don't get up. It's good to be back in Sunnydale. Nice
 climate, plenty to eat, no tortured humanity to hold me down.
 (Faith flips herself up.) But you know what bothers me? (Angel
 grabs her by the neck) You don't seem to be getting the big
 picture here, Faith. Now I don't know why you turned me, but I'm
 just glad you did."
Faith,I've got my reasons.
Angel,"Let me guess. You summoned back the true Angelus because
 you need a new boy toy. Doesn't work that way."
Faith,You wanna be smart? You listen to me.
Angel,"Funny thing about vampires, Faith. We don't establish
 meaningful dialogue with Slayers."
Faith,Not how Buffy tells it.
Angel,(chuckles) I should have known you'd like it on top.
Faith,You want to listen or you want to die?
Angel,"As long as you're there, I mostly want you to wriggle. But
 I'm listening."
Faith,"Last time you got like this, Buffy kicked your ass all the
 way back to hell. You want to do better this time?"
Angel,Still listening. (his face shifts to human)
Faith,"Good boy. Now all you got to do is play nice and call truce
 and I'll hook you up with the real power in this town. Interested?"
Angel,Very.
Faith,Then get ready to meet the new boss.
Wesley,"Our enemy has us at a disadvantage. We seem to be
 consistently one step behind him. Now he has the Books of Ascenscion.
 We must take definitive action."
Cordelia,"You have the greatest voice. Have you ever thought about doing
 books on tape?"
Xander,Way to focus CC.
Wesley,"Yes, let's, uh, let's try to stay on track. We need everyone
 working together here. Where's Angel?"
Buffy,I don't know. I went to the mansion but he wasn't there.
Wesley,And Faith?
Buffy,She's missing too.
Willow,Which means nothing. Two unconnected events.
Buffy,What should we do?
Giles,"Buffy, I think you should try to retrieve the Books of
 Ascenscion. Check out the Mayor's office but be damned careful.
 Do not confront the Mayor. We don't know a thing about him."
Buffy,"I'll go home and stock up on weapons. Slip into something a
 little more break-and-enterish."
Giles,"Right. Willow, how far did you get with the Mayor's files?"
Cordelia,"Excuse me, I believe Wesley is running this meeting."
Wesley,"It's, uh, it's quite alright. Willow?"
Willow,"It's all bad news. By the time I got through the encryptions,
 the files were empty. Guess he saw me coming."
Oz,What about the Hall of Records? Go to the source.
Wesley,Good idea. There must be information on the Mayor there.
Giles,"Wesley, why don't you take the group and start looking?"
Wesley,Right.
Cordelia,(pops up) I'm in Wesley's group.
Giles,There is just the one group.
Cordelia,Yes! And I am in it.
Xander,"Anyone mind if I skip the trip? I'm gonna cruise town, keep
 my ear to the ground, and I think five's a crowd."
Cordelia,It really is.
Oz,I'll drive.
Willow,(proud of Oz) They liked your plan.
Giles,"Anyone finds anything, check in with me. (to Buffy) Be
 careful."
Faith,"So, can I keep him?"
Mayor,"Let's just take things step by step for the moment. Now then,
 Angelus, may I call you Angel?"
Angel,"Well, actually, I'm thinking more along the lines of you
 calling me Master."
Mayor,"(unfazed) Ah. You know, Angelus, attitude may get you
 attention, but courtesy wins respect. (chuckles) I am the one
 responsible for your new attitude."
Angel,That's why I'm here.
Mayor,No problems with the transition? No side effects?
Angel,"Had a soul, now I'm free."
Mayor,"That's terrific! Poetic too. Not that I read much poetry
 except for those little ones in the Reader's Digest. You know,
 some of those are quite catchy. (chuckles)"
Angel,"Hey, I don't mean to rush things here but are you trying to
 get to some kind of point?"
Mayor,"Kids today. Rush rush rush. Well the point, Angel, is
 you're a very powerful young man, good for Faith, and there just
 may be future for you in Sunnydale. I see you're admiring my
 letter opener."
Angel,"Well, actually, I was thinking of stabbing you through the
 heart with it."
Mayor,Please do.
Mayor,Nice shot.
Mayor,"You see, I'm what you might call impervious. Can't be killed,
 or harmed in any way. (wipes the blade with a tissue) And that's
 just a cornerstone in my plans for this great town of ours."
Angel,"Mmmm. Can't be killed, but you don't like germs?"
Mayor,"Uck, eew, awful things, unsanitary. But my question is, now
 that Faith has brought you back, what are your intentions?"
Angel,"Well, gee, sir, I thought I'd find that Slayer that's given
 you so much trouble and torture, maim, and kill her."
Mayor,"Fine! You know it's nice to see you're not one of those
 slacker types running around town today. Torture Buffy. Killing
 her's fine, just make it a slow one."
Angel,My favorite kind.
Mayor,"Wonderful, wonderful. We don't want a replacement Slayer
 anytime soon. They can't all turn out like my girl Faith.
 (Faith smiles) Have fun."
Faith,Let's do it.
Mayor,"Uh, try to have her home by eleven."
Mayor,She's not a little girl anymore.
Xander,"I love when you talk, Wesley. I love when you sing, Wesley.
 Can you say the words jailbait, Wesley? Limey bastard. (sees
 Angel and Faith approach) Hey guys! Man, where you been? You
 gotta find Buffy. She's going to her place and stocking up on ..."
Angel,That guy just bugs me.
Joyce,Faith. Angel.
Angel,"Hi, Joyce, nice to see you. Is Buffy home?"
Joyce,Upstairs. Please tell me it's not some vampire thing.
Angel,"The only vampire here is me, Joyce. Say, you change your hair?"
Joyce,(shrugs) Highlights.
Angel,Nice.
Faith,Knock knock.
Buffy,Where have you guys been?
Angel,"Been looking for you. Good thing we found you before we left.
 (kisses the top of Buffy's head)"
Faith,We got the books.
Angel,They're at the mansion.
Faith,"We'd take 'em to Giles ourselves, but I think strength in
 numbers is the way to go. Come on."
Angel,(Takes the weapons bag) Let me get those for you.
Buffy,"Okay, let's get the books someplace safe. Where are they?"
Angel,"Actually, there's been a slight change in plan, Buff."
Buffy,Buff? You just called ... What's the matter with you?
Angel,"Nothing. (his face has vamped) Matter of act, I haven't felt
 this good in a long time."
Buffy,Angel?
Angel,"You know, I never properly thanked you for sending me to hell."
Buffy,No.
Angel,"Yeah, and I'm just wondering where do I start? Card? Fruit
 basket? Evisceration? (grasps Buffy's arms)"
Buffy,No.
Angel,"Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Maybe there's still some
 good deep down inside of me that remembers and loves you. If only you
 could reach me. Then again, we have reality."
Buffy,"I will kill you before I let you touch me. Faith, we need to
 get out of here, now."
Faith,"Speak for yourself, B. Me, I like it here."
Angel,"One thing I learned about Buffy, she's so cute when she's
 sleeping."
Cordelia,"Hey! I know a way to make investigating the Mayor even more
 boring. On second thought, no, I don't."
Oz,"Hey, whoa."
Willow,"Whoa. Big hey whoa. Guys, check this out. Wow, like father,
 like son."
Oz,"How about like exact same guy, like exact same guy?"
Wesley,Mayor Wilkins is over one hundred years old. He's not human.
Xander,"I, uh, hate to spoil the mood, but this is so much worse than
 you think."
Willow,"Xander, what happened to you?"
Xander,"You know how some people hate to say I told you so? Not me.
 I told you so. Angel's back in the really bad sense, and uh,
 I told you so."
Wesley,"Angelus has turned? Xander, this is terribly serious. Are
 you sure?"
Xander,"Gee, let me think. Kind of hard to tell. Last thing I remember
 was his fist."
Wesley,We must contact Giles immediately.
Xander,"Good thinking. Let's waste time with a lively debate. Leave
 Buffy alone. See how dead she gets."
Cordelia,"Slow down, Xander. This isn't Wesley's fault."
Xander,"Actually, it is. Faith was your responsibility. Guess who's
 Angel's new playmate?"
Willow,Faith and Angel? Together?
Xander,Imagine the possibilities.
Angel,"Morning, sleepyhead. You know what I just can't believe? All
 of our time together and we never tried chains. Well, can't dwell
 on the past, especially with the future we have ahead."
Faith,"Bondage looks good on you, B. The outfit's all wrong, but,
 hey!"
Buffy,You don't know what you're doing.
Faith,"Really? Weird, because something about all this just feels so
 right. Maybe it's one of those unhappy childhood things. See, when
 I was a kid I used to beg my mom for a dog. Didn't matter what kind.
 I just wanted, you know, something to love. (kisses Angel) A dog's
 all I wanted. Well, that and toys. (lifts a blanket to reveal
 torture instruments) But mom was so busy, you know, enjoying the
 drinking and passing out parts of life, that I never really got what
 I wanted, until now."
Buffy,"Faith, listen to me very closely. Angel's a killer. When he's
 done with me, he'll turn on you."
Angel,She's right. I probably will.
Faith,"Yeah? Hunh. Guess we'll just have to keep you around for a
 while then. Before we get started, I just want you to know, if
 you're a screamer, feel free."
Buffy,"Why, Faith? What's in it for you?"
Faith,"What isn't? You know, I come to Sunnydale. I'm the Slayer. I
 do my job kicking ass better than anyone. What do I hear about
 everywhere I go? Buffy. So I slay, I behave, I do the good little
 girl routine. And who's everybody thank? Buffy."
Buffy,It's not my fault.
Faith,"Everybody always asks, why can't you be more like Buffy? But
 did anyone ever ask if you could be more like me?"
Angel,I know I didn't.
Faith,"You get the Watcher. You get the mom. You get the little
 Scooby gang. What do I get? Jack squat. This is supposed to be
 my town!"
Buffy,"Faith, listen to me!"
Faith,"Why? So you can impart some special Buffy wisdom, that it?
 Do you think you're better than me? Do you? Say it, you think
 you're better than me."
Buffy,I am. Always have been.
Faith,"Um, maybe you didn't notice. Angel's with me."
Buffy,"And how did you get him, Faith? Magic? Cast some sort of
 spell? Cause in the real world, Angel would never touch you and we
 both know it."
Buffy,"You had to tie me up to beat me. There's a word for people
 like you, Faith. Loser."
Faith,"Uh huh. You're just trying to make me mad so I'll kill you.
 I'm too smart for that. Stick around."
Buffy,"For what? Your boss's lame Ascenscion. Like I couldn't stop
 it."
Faith,You can't.
Buffy,I will.
Faith,"Keep dreaming. No one can stop the Ascenscion. Mayor's got
 it wired, B. He built this town for demons to feed on and come
 graduation day, he's getting paid. And I'll be sitting at his
 right hand. Assuming he has hands after the transformation. I'm
 not too clear on that part. And all your little lame ass friends
 are going to be kibbles'n'bits. Think about that when your
 boyfriends cutting into you."
Buffy,I never knew you had so much rage in you.
Faith,What can I say? I'm the world's best actor.
Angel,Second best.
Buffy,Graduation day. You think we missed anything?
Angel,I think we know everything she knows.
Buffy,May I say something? (pulls her hands free) Psych!
Faith,You played me. You played me!
Faith,"What are you gonna do, B, kill me? You become me. You're not
 ready for that, yet."
Willow,Are you okay?
Mage,The task is finished.
Giles,"Yes. Thank you for coming to me and for that rather effective
 light show you put on."
Mage,"This restores the balance between us, Rupert Giles. My debt
 to you is now repaid in full. Do not call upon me."
Giles,I shan't. Peace with you.
Mage,And with you.
Willow,His debt to you is repaid? What did you do?
Giles,I introduced him to his wife.
Wesley,"Well, I for one protest. You pitted Slayer against Slayer in
 a dangerous charade that could've gotten them both killed, without
 informing me! I'm telling the Council! (storms off)"
Giles,"I think you should. (Wesley stops) We have a rogue Slayer on
 our hands. I can't think of anything more dangerous."
Buffy,At least now we know.
Giles,And we know a little bit more about the Ascenscion.
Willow,"Graduation day. There's a big scary un-fun. At least Angel's
 not bad, though. That's good, right?"
Xander,"Yes, I feel so much better knowing that he broke my face in
 a good way. It's a good bruise."
Buffy,"(sad) He was only acting, Xander. It was just an act."
Mayor,"Well, you win some, you lose some. From where I'm sitting,
 it's batting average that counts. So you lost some friends."
Faith,I wouldn't exactly call them friends.
Mayor,"Well, what are you worried about? Chin up! You don't see me
 looking disappointed. Heck, no. You know why? Because I know you'll
 always have me, Faith. I'm the best, the most important friend
 you'll ever have. Besides, you know, once the Ascenscion starts,
 the 'in' crowd you're so concerned about? Whoo! They'll be lucky
 if there's enough left of them to fill a pothole. Promise. Still
 unhappy? Okey doke. I've got two words that are going to make all
 the pain go away. Miniature golf. (grins)"
Angel,How you doing?
Buffy,Been better.
Angel,"Not hard to believe. You were a real soldier last night, Buffy."
Buffy,That's me. One of the troops.
Angel,I know how hard it was for you.
Buffy,I really doubt that.
Angel,Is there anything I can do to make it better?
Buffy,"Look, I know you only did what I asked. And we, we got what
 we wanted."
Angel,I never wanted it to go that far.
Buffy,"I know that. It's not even a question of that. It's just,
 after ... I need a little bit of a break. Please. (walks away)"
Angel,You still my girl?
