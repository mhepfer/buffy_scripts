<blockquote>GILES VOICEOVER,Previously...
SPIKE,You never had it so good as me.
BUFFY,"If you tell anyone about last night, I will kill you."
BUFFY,"So you three have, what, banded together to be pains in my ass?"
"WARREN: We're your arch-nemesises ... ses. You may have beaten us this time, Slayer, but next time...JONATHAN",Maybe not!Jonathan throwing down the smoke-bomb. The Geek Trio escaping.
BUFFY,Amy? How've you been?
AMY,Rat. You?
BUFFY,Dead.
AMY,Oh.
WILLOW,"It's nice, having another magically-inclined friend around."
AMY,It's way too early to go home yet.
AMY,So what do you wanna do? I have a better idea.
WILLOW,Is it dangerous?
WILLOW,Let's get outta here.
WILLOW,"Dawnie, I'm sorry, I'm so-"
BUFFY,You could have killed her.
WILLOW,I need help!
WILLOW,No more spells. I'm finished.
WILLOW,There's some money stuff we're gonna have to talk to you about.
BUFFY,So you're telling me I'm broke?
GILES,How bad is it?
BUFFY,Anya says pretty bad.
GILES,"Buffy ... some discussion, about, um ... wha-what you're going to do now."
BUFFY,Oh. I've been giving that a lot of thought actually. And I think I've figured it out.
XANDER,"Now I get Warren being the supervillainy type, but I thought Jonathan completely learned that lesson. I never even heard of this other guy."
WILLOW,You should have seen their headquarters. It was like the nerd natural habitat.
ANYA,"Well, if we know where they are, shouldn't we do something?"
WILLOW,We tried. Buffy was gonna go in there and bust them on the spot.
XANDER,I'm sensing a 'not so completely.'
WILLOW,"Yeah, well, she went in, and then-"
ANYA,"Speaking of Buffy, isn't she ready? She's gonna be late for her first day."
WILLOW,"Hey, respect the narrative flow much?"
ANYA,Please continue the story of failure.
WILLOW,"So, Buffy went in, but they'd cleared out. And she brought back the stuff that they left... (Xander listening, eating popcorn) ... spell books, some parchments, (smiling) a couple of rare things, charmed objects, and a conjurer's harp..."
WILLOW,"(snaps out of it) A-and they had other stuff, you know, Razor scooters, and pictures of the Vulcan woman on ""Enterprise."""
XANDER,"Ooh! (chuckles, rubs his hands together, then sees Anya's expression) I mean ... nerds."
ANYA,"Okay. See, this is why demons are better than people."
WILLOW,Interesting turn.
ANYA,"When I was a vengeance demon, I caused pain and mayhem, certainly. But I put in a full day's work doing it, and I got compensated appropriately."
XANDER,Welcome to today's episode of 'Go Money Go!' I hear it daily.
WILLOW,"Yep, for the rest of your life."
ANYA,"But supervillains ... want reward without labor, to make things come easy. (lecturing) It's wrong. Without labor there can be no payment, and vice versa. (Shot of Willow listening intently) The country cannot progress. The workers are the tools that shape America."
BUFFY,(OS) Good to know.
BUFFY,I was kinda feelin' like a tool.
BUFFY,And now I know why.
NARRATOR,You've seen us in your city or small town across the American West...
NARRATOR,...you've ordered our delicious food...
NARRATOR,...from our happy employees!
NARRATOR,"But now you're seeing it all from a different way, you're seeing it from behind the counter!"
NARRATOR,...because you've just become part of the DoubleMeat experience!
BOY,I'm part of it!
WOMAN,I'm part of it!
MAN,I'm a part of it too!
NARRATOR,"This cow... (cow moos) and this chicken... (chicken appears beside the cow, and squawks) ...don't know it yet, but they're destined to become part of it as well! So what happens when a cow and a chicken come together?"
NARRATOR,"Why, that's a DoubleMeat Medley! Let's take a look now at the process of harvesting these two special meats."
BUFFY,Holy crap!
NARRATOR,...washing your hands thoroughly after each visit to the restroom.
"The man takes a paper towel to dry his hands. Zoom in on the paper-towel dispenser bearing the words, ""NOTICE","Employees must wash hands with soap before returning to work."""
NARRATOR,Follow these rules and you'll be a happy part of the DoubleMeat family for a long time!
MANNY,"Interesting, isn't it?"
BUFFY,"(fake smile) Oh yes! Like how the cow and the chicken come together even though they've never met. It's like <I>Sleepless in Seattle</I> if, (Manny turning off the TV) if Meg and Tom were, like, minced."
MANNY,"I'm Manny the manager. It's not a joke, it's just my name."
BUFFY,Right. Y-you mentioned that a couple of times when I filled out the application.
MANNY,"Why do you want to work here, Buffy? You seem like a sharp young woman, and there are a lot of other jobs."
BUFFY,"Well, I-I kinda need money pretty quickly, like, today, and, and so I didn't want to go through a lengthy interview process, and I figured this was probably the fastest... way... to..."
BUFFY,Be...cause I ... wanted to be part of the DoubleMeat experience?
MANNY,"Come on, let's take a tour."
MANNY,"Philip, Timothy, this is Buffy. She's going to work the counter."
BUFFY,Hi.
PHILIP,(to Manny) What happened to the other one? Catherine?
MANNY,Emily?
PHILIP,Yeah.
TIMOTHY,She's gone.
BUFFY,What happened?
TIMOTHY,Whatever always happens.
MANNY,(turns) You can use this one.
BUFFY,"Uh ... there's, there's someone's stuff in there."
MANNY,"They must have left it. You can toss it, or keep what you want."
BUFFY,Sure they're not coming back?
MANNY,We have a lot of turnover here.
MANNY,Watch these two. (continues walking)
BUFFY,(follows) Are they gonna do something?
MANNY,They're solid. Follow their example and you won't go wrong.
MANNY,They're lifers.
BUFFY,Lifers?
MANNY,"In it for life. Like me. You wanna get something out of this, Buffy? You'll do the same. You put the work in, and ten years from now, you'll be where I am."
MANNY,I promise you.
MANNY,Congratulations. You're on the clock.
MANNY,This is the kitchen. The beating heart of the DoubleMeat Palace.
BUFFY,Wow. They're all so ... identical.
MANNY,Yeah. They all start to look the same to me too.
BUFFY,"Oh, no, not the employees, the, the chicken slices."
MAN,"Uh yeah, Medley meal number 2, uh, double-size it..."
MANNY,"(pointing) Drive-through station's over there. High pressure job, you won't need to go in there. (pointing around) Over there's the grills, the fryers, the walk-in freezer..."
MANNY,(alarmed) You don't need to go in there either! (follows her)
MANNY,That's the dehydrated pickle storage. (Buffy trying to open the filing cabinet) Those are locked!
MANNY,Now I want to show you this.
MANNY,Look. The DoubleMeat Medley.
BUFFY,"Oh, I know the Medley! It's just, uh, the video was ... kind of graphic, with the slaughter. (wrinkling her nose)"
MANNY,"(gesturing at the sandwich with his other hand) The classic double-decker with a twist. A pure beefy patty above the mid-bun ... and a slice of processed chicken product below the mid-bun. Plus pickles, and the secret ingredient. (holds it out toward Buffy) Eat it."
BUFFY,"Oh, you know, I had a-a big breakfast. I'll just wait for..."
BUFFY,Uh ... but it smells so good.
BUFFY,"Mm. (mouth full) So, what *is* your secret ingredient?"
MANNY,It's a meat process.
MANNY,"Now I think it's time to start earning your money, don't you, Buffy?"
BUFFY,(smiling nervously) Mm-hmm.
BUFFY,So ... what's the deal with Manny the manager? If I ask him really nice can I write a children's book called that?
GARY,(hands her an empty paper cup) Fill this while I get the fries. (turns away)
BUFFY,(looking at cup) Fill this? I didn't know there was gonna be drug testing on this job.
GARY,(laughs) You're funny. (stops smiling) You better stop that.
BUFFY,(filling the cup at a soda dispenser) Why?
GARY,Productivity. One of Manny's watch-words. 'Levity is the time-thief that picks the pocket of the company.'
BUFFY,"I prefer the one that goes, 'Manny's a humorless dolt who picks the pocket of he-should-bite-me.'"
GARY,(sighs) You really need to be quiet with that.
GARY,Here you go.
CUSTOMER,Thanks.
WIG LADY,"I'd like a small coffee, and cherry pie."
GARY,"That's a dollar ninety-two, ma'am."
BUFFY,"(staring) You hit so many buttons, it's like, button-palooza."
GARY,"No, it's easy, I - look."
GARY,"There are little pictures of the food on the buttons. (shot of his finger pointing at the buttons) I hit the coffee button, then I hit the small button. And then cherry pie. There's a picture of a little fried pie."
BUFFY,Uh-huh.
GARY,"Then, I hit the total button... (putting the money away) I put the money in the drawer, I close it, and it resets the system. A cocker spaniel could do it. (looks at the customers) Here, why don't you take the next one, the family? They're regulars."
BUFFY,(to wig lady) Hi. I'm new.
WIG LADY,(smiling) I come here every day.
BUFFY,(smiling) That's nice.
WIG LADY,"Oh, you really might make it, dear. Not like some of them, where suddenly you never see them again. I can see you here a long time."
BUFFY,(fake smile) That's great.
WIG LADY,Thank you.
She takes it and moves away. The family moves up,"father, mother, and three kids."
BUFFY,"Hi. Welcome to the DoubleMeat Palace, may I help you?"
FATHER,"Yeah. We need two Number Four Medley Meals, a junior Medley, a Fisherman's Medley with bacon, and a kid's meal. Plus three fries, a chocolatey shake, and extra pickles on one of the Medleys."
BUFFY,"Excuse me. Um, this button. (pointing) Does it look chocolatey to you?"
MANNY,You don't need to be in there.
BUFFY,(nervous) Sorry. I was just curious.
MANNY,Curiosity killed the cat. (moves away)
BUFFY,(to herself) Theory number five. Cat burgers.
DAWN,(smiling) Hey Buffy!
ANYA,We're here to support your subsistence-level employment. Bravo.
BUFFY,(smiling) Thank you. This is cool of you guys.
XANDER,"So, Buff, how's it going?"
BUFFY,"I don't know. I-I've waitressed before, but ... this is different."
DAWN,"(frowns) Uh, when have you waitressed?"
BUFFY,"That summer in L.A. It was a diner, and ... we had, you know, lots of people who didn't tip, (Willow playing with the straws in the straw dispenser) and funny funny health code violations ... but ... it, it wasn't like it is here. (quietly) I think there's something wrong, here. W-Will, are you okay?"
WILLOW,"Uh, sorry, I, uh... (puts the straws back) Yeah, uh ... something's wrong?"
BUFFY,"There's, there's this manager, right, and he's all scary and mysterious, you know? And then there's the secret ingredient. And, (even quieter) and the people that work here? They're, they're kind of strange, you know? They just ... just stare into space ... plus they disappear."
ANYA,Disappear poof?
BUFFY,"No, not poof. Well, I don't think so."
XANDER,"It's fast food. I have swum these murky waters, my friend. There's the assorted creepiness, there's staring, there's the enthusiastic not showing up at all. I think you're seeing demons where there's just life."
BUFFY,"I, I didn't say demons. It's just a vibe. I mean, you guys still haven't seen this manager."
ANYA,"Well, isn't that him over there, getting the pickles wet?"
XANDER,"Yeah, with the saddle shoes... (close shot on Manny's feet)"
WILLOW,...and the glasses?
BUFFY,"I don't know. Maybe it's just the video that's freakin' me out. (wrinkling her nose) With the cow, and the chicken, all swirly together. (Willow making an ""ew"" face)"
XANDER,"Mm, make me hungry, why don't you? (looking up at the menu board) How's about one of those delicious Medley Meals?"
BUFFY,"Okay, you got it. On me. (moves away)"
XANDER,"Hey, thanks! (to the others) See, I think she'll be fine once she settles into the routine. And by ordering, I'm helping."
DAWN,And getting a free meal?
XANDER,"Well, yeah."
ANYA,"Well, if you like the food here, honey, maybe we should get it for the reception."
DAWN,You're serving burgers? (Anya nods) Cool!
ANYA,"Well, time is running very short. After Willow gave us the 'whoosh' engagement party, I got slack on the planning 'cause I figured she'd help, but, well, now that's all been blown to hell."
WILLOW,"Hey, standing right here! Standing right exactly here."
ANYA,Sorry. Didn't mean to tempt you.
ANYA,"(whispers to Dawn) Everyone's so delicate. (normal voice) Anyway, I still have to select the bridesmaids' dresses, and, well, then there are the guests from out of town and the ones from the demon realm -- you wouldn't believe how many of them have yet to let us know either way."
BUFFY,"There you go, and I double-sized it for ya."
XANDER,"Oh, thank you!"
BUFFY,And cut way back on the cat.
XANDER,(mouth full) Cat?!
BUFFY,Just kidding. (Xander gives a sarcastic laugh) Probably.
BUFFY,(to herself) Sloooow night.
BUFFY,Gina.
BUFFY,"(taking off her cap) Since it's slow, do you think they'll mind if I take another break?"
GINA,We're not allowed. Downtime robs us all.
BUFFY,"Mm, thus quoth Manny. There's no one here."
GINA,Sure there is. (indicating the counter) Look.
BUFFY,"This'll make my day complete. (sighs, walks over to the cash register) What?"
SPIKE,What's in the DoubleMeat nuggets?
BUFFY,I'm working. Go away.
SPIKE,"Yeah, and you chose to be in the consumer service profession, and I'm a consumer. (smirking) Service me."
BUFFY,(not amused) Order something or go.
SPIKE,(sighs) Give a bloke a chance for his eyes to adjust. Damn fluorescent lights. Makes me look dead.
SPIKE,"Some demons love 'em. The way they vibrate makes the skin twitch. That the kinda demon you are, luv?"
BUFFY,"I am not a demon. I don't know why you can hit me, but (firmly) I am not a demon."
SPIKE,"Oh. I see. That why you took this job? Prove something to yourself? A normal job for a normal girl? (shakes his head) Good way to drive yourself crazy, that is."
BUFFY,(shrugs) I'll be fine.
SPIKE,Buffy.
SPIKE,You're not happy here.
BUFFY,(quietly) Please don't make this harder.
SPIKE,You don't belong here. You're something ... you're better than this.
BUFFY,I need the money.
SPIKE,"I can get money. (gestures with his head) Walk with me now, come on."
BUFFY,I ... I need to go help Gary with the fries.
SPIKE,"You gotta get outta here, this place'll do stuff to you."
SPIKE,This place'll kill you!
GARY,Someone there?
GARY,"Oh, hi, what are you doing? What, what-"
Cut to inside. Close shot on the time clock reading 9,00. We see Buffy standing behind Timothy as he punches in.
BUFFY,"(sighs) Feels like I just left, you know?"
TIMOTHY,You came back. (punches his card)
BUFFY,(not thrilled) I came back.
MANNY,Gary's gone.
BUFFY,"Gary. Oh, the guy that helped me out at the counter yesterday?"
MANNY,He didn't show up this morning.
BUFFY,"Well, shift's just starting."
MANNY,He was supposed to unlock early this morning. Didn't show. Pull his card.
BUFFY,"(frowns) Well, I'm, I'm sure, you know, he's just late. (removes Gary's card from the rack) He didn't seem like he was leaving."
MANNY,I'm moving Timothy to counter. You're on grill.
BUFFY,Me?
MANNY,I've been watching you.
BUFFY,B-but I-I don't know how to grill.
MANNY,(smiling) Just think. This is the last day you'll ever be able to say that.
PHILIP,"You put the beef on the grill, you hit the button, then it beeps. You flip the beef, hit the other button, then it beeps. You put it on the bun... (pauses, thinking) There's not a button for that."
BUFFY,Repeat until insane.
PHILIP,It eliminates variation. (pushes button) Every burger at every DoubleMeat Palace is the same. (Buffy looking at him) People don't like variation.
BUFFY,Got it. Variety is the spice of bad.
PHILIP,Mm.
BUFFY,So ... what's the secret ingredient?
PHILIP,(not taking his eyes off the grill) It's a meat process.
BUFFY,"Well, what does that mean?"
PHILIP,"It's a process, they do it to the meat."
BUFFY,"But, what *is* it?"
PHILIP,It's just the name of the process.
BUFFY,(giving up) Oh. Yeah.
BUFFY,"So, I ... guess we're gonna get ... kinda greasy, huh?"
PHILIP,Mm.
PHILIP,Skin ... hair ... eyelashes ... nostrils...
PHILIP,...inside your ears... (looks at Buffy) You wanna look inside my ears?
BUFFY,"(very disgusted) No. No, that's okay."
PHILIP,Once I noticed I couldn't hear and went to the doctor. He said it was grease ... that made a plug.
BUFFY,(ew) Ohh.
PHILIP,Mm. They gave me a kit. Kit for cleaning my ears. (smiling) It's got this little bulb mechanism.
BUFFY,(fake smile) Imagine that.
MANNY,(OS) Buffy?
BUFFY,Yay! It's Manny!
MANNY,You're working a double shift.
BUFFY,What? A...nother eight hours? Right after these eight hours? But that's ... (whining) so many hours.
MANNY,You get paid for it. Plus an extra free DoubleMeat Medley.
BUFFY,(pouting) What happened? Why the double shiftiness?
MANNY,Gary didn't show. And now one of my grinder guys is late too.
BUFFY,"But they could still show up, right? I mean, they could be anywhere."
TIMOTHY,Your meat's here.
Cut to,"Xander's apartment. Xander sits on the sofa, talking on the phone."
XANDER,"Yeah, okay, bye. (hangs up, yells) Ahn, that was Buffy, she's working late, so I might have to go- yah!"
HALFREK,"(deep resonant voice) I have been called, and vengeance shall I wreak. (points at Xander) Cower, masculine one ... tremble as you face my wrath!"
ANYA,"Xander, I'm starting to think that maybe we should do a pot-luck thing."
XANDER,Honey?
HALFREK,(resonant voice) Hello. I am here to tear this man apart. (Anya smiling happily) How many pieces do you wish?
ANYA,Halfrek!
HALFREK,(normal woman's voice) Anyanka? Oh my god!
ANYA,"How are you, how are you?"
XANDER,You two ... you know each other?
ANYA,"Funny, Halfrek, I didn't summon you to kill Xander, I called to invite you to our wedding."
HALFREK,"Y- Oh my ... what an embarrassing mistake! (Anya shows her the engagement ring) Oh my god, gorgeous!"
XANDER,"Wow, um, you two clearly have some catching up to do. So I'll, uh ... (gestures) I'll not be in the apartment."
ANYA,"Gosh, it's swell to see you again, Hallie, I didn't mean to have you materialize all the way here, I mean, not-not till the ceremony, I mean."
HALFREK,"I guess I got the message garbled. (laughs) You know how it is, half the time I have no idea if I'm maiming the right guy."
HALFREK,"So, um ... you're marrying that man with the large upper arms?"
ANYA,(smiling) Yes.
HALFREK,Why?
ANYA,"Well, because I love him."
HALFREK,Hmm.
ANYA,"Oh, we're gonna be very happy together."
HALFREK,Hmm.
ANYA,What?
TIMOTHY,(OS) It's boiling with nothing in it. Sometimes it does that.
TIMOTHY,"They say bugs fall in there. (pause) Oh, I'm back. You can go on your break now."
WILLOW,Come in.
AMY,It's me. Dawn said I could come up.
AMY,"So, is she pissed at you too, or just me? (Willow doesn't reply) What did you tell her about me?"
WILLOW,D'you want something? (fidgeting nervously with her pen)
AMY,"Um ... yeah ... actually. I mean, I, I don't, don't know if you wanted to keep it, or..."
WILLOW,You want it? Really?
AMY,"Well, yeah, you know, I mean ... it's not much, but it's home. Or it was. I don't know, I guess it's stupid, but..."
WILLOW,"No, i-it's not stupid. You can have it, of course."
AMY,Hey. So I hear you got this whole cold-turkey thing goin' on. (Willow nods) How's that going?
WILLOW,"It's good. It's really good. I mean, i-it was hard at first ... frustrating ... doing everything the slow way. It was like, 'is everything gonna take forever, forever?'"
AMY,(sympathetically) Yeah.
WILLOW,"(still fiddling with pen) But, uh, it's better now. I'm ... getting my focus back."
AMY,Mm. I can see that.
WILLOW,"(defensively) It's a pivotal page. (sits up, closes book)"
AMY,"So this is it, huh? This is ... gonna be your life from now on?"
WILLOW,What? (uncertainly) No.
AMY,"Well, you're never gonna do it again. Ever. (gets up) You're never gonna ... feel how it made you feel."
WILLOW,Don't think that's the way to look at it.
AMY,"Hey Will? It's your birthday. (stands up, picks up the cage)"
WILLOW,"Um, no it isn't. But now that you mention it, Buffy's is coming..."
AMY: <I>Potestas</I>. (latin translation,"""power"" or ""you have the power."")"
WILLOW,What? (looking at her hands)
WILLOW,(alarmed) Amy...
AMY,(smiling) It's a gift. It's magic ... and it didn't come from you. It came from me. Completely legal. (pause) Enjoy.
Cut to,"exterior shot of the DoubleMeat Palace, night."
BUFFY,Look! Look what I found under the meat grinder!
MANNY,Oh my god.
BUFFY,Wanna tell me what's going on?
MANNY,I'm not sure.
BUFFY,Try again.
MANNY,"(nervous) Well... there was an accident, maybe six weeks ago, a grinder incident."
BUFFY,"Right, but see, *this* isn't six weeks old. This, is new."
MANNY,"It is? Oh... well, maybe Gary did come in this morning, or, I don't know, late last night, maybe there was an accident. Got himself to the hospital."
BUFFY,"Right. Maybe he's in the hospital. (louder) Or maybe, he's in the grinder! Huh? Huh? Meat process, secret ingredient? Maybe, Gary's on the grill! Or maybe he's under the pickle chips!"
MANNY,Buffy. Buffy!
BUFFY,"(yells) Stop! Stop! Everyone, you have to stop! Stop eating!"
BUFFY,"No, you can't have this! It's not beef! It's people!"
BUFFY,The DoubleMeat Medley is people!
BUFFY,The meat layer is definitely people! It's people! It's people! Probably not the chickeny part. But who knows? Who! Knows!
WIG LADY,What about the cherry pie?
MANNY,What are you doing? I thought you were part of the team!
MANNY,You are fired.
HALFREK,Tell me more about Xander.
ANYA,You keep asking about him. Do you think I'm making a mistake?
HALFREK,Do you?
ANYA,"Well, no! Xander, he... (ponders) He's very kind, and brave ... he has the sweetest smile and the nicest body, and ... he loves me. I mean, sometimes it isn't easy, but, he does."
HALFREK,Who told you that it isn't easy to love you?
"ANYA: Well, you know, I'll do something, or say something, and, and then he has to say stuff like, (imitating Xander) 'it's incorrect for you to appreciate money so much,' or, or, 'Observe",here is how a real human would behave.'
HALFREK,"Oh, so he corrects you?"
ANYA,"Well, no, it's just ... um ... well, no, I mean, now I'm all confused, I mean, wha, do you think there's something wrong with, with the way he treats me?"
HALFREK,(shrugs) Do you?
ANYA,"Okay, you have to stop doing that. I love Xander."
HALFREK,Even though he thinks he knows better than you?
ANYA,"B-but he doesn't, he doesn't think that."
HALFREK,"(quickly) Okay. I'm sorry. (small laugh) I was just curious. You know, you don't have to say another thing about it if you're not comfortable."
ANYA,B-but I am! I mean ... it's not like I'm hiding any deficiencies or anything.
HALFREK,Hmm.
XANDER,I have absolutely no threes. Go fish.
BUFFY,"(hands on hips) I call an emergency meeting, and this is it? Where's Willow? Where's Anya?"
DAWN,I-I couldn't find Willow. I knocked and knocked on her door.
XANDER,"And Anya's entertaining a vengeance demon named Hallie. Say Buff, did you ever see Anya as a demon? 'Cause if that's it ... whoa."
BUFFY,There's something wrong at the DoubleMeat Palace. Really wrong.
DAWN,Have you been demon-fighting? Is that why you smell funny?
BUFFY,No! I'm talking about...
BUFFY,"Ucch. That's great. That's, that's just great. I try to do the simplest thing in the world, get an ordinary job in a well-lit place, and look, I'm right back where I started. Blood and death and funky smells. (fiddling with something on the counter) Look. Look what I found near the grinder."
DAWN,(very heartfelt) Ew. (pause) Whose is it?
BUFFY,"I don't know. It might be this guy named Gary, the only one in the whole place who didn't seem all brain-dead. He didn't show up this morning. Except now I think he was there the whole time. As the secret ingredient. We need to analyze that burger. We need to find out if it used to be people."
XANDER,What?!
XANDER,(swallows) People?
BUFFY,"Xander, you ate the burger?!"
XANDER,"(stands up, yells) Well, first you say it's cat, then you come in and hand me a burger, blah blah blah, five minutes later 'oh and by the way, it happens to be hot delicious human flesh'!"
BUFFY,I needed that burger to analyze it. Now I'm gonna have to get another one.
XANDER,*That's* your problem with this scenario? You getting seconds?
WILLOW,"Late! Late, sorry, I ... I was reading for school, well, highlighting anyway. (quietly) Anyway, late."
XANDER,"Yeah, you just (deep breath, gesturing at the empty wrapper) missed the Gary burger."
WILLOW,What are we doing? Let's jump right in. Did Xander say something about food?
DAWN,You wouldn't want any. Apparently the DoubleMeat Medley is people.
WILLOW,Whoa. Bad.
BUFFY,I bet it's not even just this one time. Or even this one town. There are DoubleMeat Palaces all over California.
DAWN,(disgusted) I've eaten there a lot.
BUFFY,"Well, everyone has! They've got the perfect deal. Everyone expects high turnover of the employees, they get the meat for nothing, and ... (pauses) And they have us disposing of the bodies! How sick is that? (Xander still looking disgusted) We need to bring down the whole corporation. Will, Xander ate the burger, is there any way for sure to figure out what it was?"
WILLOW,"Well, yeah, I can start analyzing it with science, not ... I can use science. (to Xander) You ate it?"
DAWN,"Um, we have the wrapper. There's little scribbles of meat on the wrapper. (Willow nods)"
BUFFY,"(picking up her jacket) Okay, good, you guys get working on that. It's after closing, so I'm gonna go there and see what I can find out. (leaves)"
WILLOW,"(breathing heavily) Cool, you go. We'll be good."
DAWN,Are you okay?
WILLOW,I'm just worried about Buffy.
WILLOW VOICEOVER,She could be walking into anything.
BUFFY,Manny?
BUFFY,(OS) Ohh. Manny?
BUFFY,Guess you really were a lifer.
WILLOW,(whispers) Don't need magic. Don't need it. Don't need it.
DAWN,My friend Janice? Her sister's a lawyer.
XANDER,You think I should sue over the burger? That's interesting.
DAWN,"No, I just mean... (sighs) Buffy's never gonna be a lawyer, or a doctor. Anything big."
XANDER,She's a Slayer. She saves the whole world. That's way bigger.
DAWN,"But that means she's gonna have like crap jobs her entire life, right? Minimum wage stuff. I mean, I could still grow up to be anything. But for her ... this is it."
XANDER,"Okay, but maybe you'll be a lawyer or a doctor, and you can use all your money to support your deadbeat sister."
DAWN,"(sarcastic) Oh, that's terrifically better. Thanks."
WILLOW,"Hey, guys, I-I think I've got it."
XANDER,"Good job, Will. Those aren't, like, potions, are they?"
WILLOW,"No, no potions. It's not magic, it's chemistry. You can tell by how damn slow it is."
WILLOW,I made a solution that reacts to the proteins in human blood. So we're pretty close to knowing for certain.
ANYA,(panting) I'm here! I'm here.
DAWN,We're doing chemistry.
ANYA,Oh. So sorry I hurried.
XANDER,"Hey, did your friend have a good time? And then leave?"
ANYA,(sullen) She's gone.
XANDER,"So, Ahn, the way she looked, with ... the face... (nervous laugh) That wasn't what you used to look like, was it?"
ANYA,"Is there something wrong with that? I mean, did you think she was unattractive?"
XANDER,"Okay, is there any answer to that question that won't make you nuts?"
ANYA,Halfrek was always considered to be a great beauty.
XANDER,"Well, hon, she was a little... (Anya glaring) ...there was some veinyness."
WILLOW,"Hold this. (hands something to Xander) Okay. If the solution reacts to the proteins, then I'll be able to see it. (quickly) I mean, I'll be able to look through the microscope and, and then see it. (bends over the microscope)"
ANYA,"(to Xander) It's not like you're so perfect either, what with your ... strangely large upper arms and your tendency to criticize."
XANDER,Huh?
DAWN,(to Willow) What do you see?
WILLOW,There's no reaction.
XANDER,"Oh god, no! No reaction!"
WILLOW,Which means it's not human.
XANDER,(upset) It's not human! (realizing) It's not human?
ANYA,"Well, is it demony? I mean, maybe someone's ... you know, killing demons and using them as a cheap source of meat. I mean, we've all heard of that."
ANYA,"And by the way, I'm opposed to using demon meat, no matter how much money it saves. (to Xander) Does that surprise you?"
XANDER,"Again, I say 'huh?'"
WILLOW,"(still looking in microscope) No, I'm not sure what I'm seeing. Cellulose?"
WILLOW,There's something weird here.
BUFFY,Scalp?
BUFFY,Wig! (picks it up) Wig lady?
WIG LADY,(OS) Oh dear.
WIG LADY,"Wig lady, is that what they call me?"
WIG LADY,"I don't care for that. (takes a few steps closer) I mean, I have to do something to hide this."
WIG LADY,"It's paralyzing. Don't try to move, dear. You really can't, much."
WIG LADY,"The paralysis spreads upward, by the way. You may want to flail your arms a bit while you still can."
WIG LADY,Did I tell you? You're my favorite.
WIG LADY,"DoubleMeat workers. You're all so full of DoubleMeat burgers, and you just slide down so smooth."
WIG LADY,"Oh, I just love the paralysis. It means I can eat you slowly."
WIG LADY,I know you're under there.
WILLOW,(OS) Buffy? Are you in there?
WILLOW,I can't see you inside.
WILLOW,"(OS) Buffy, if you're in there, the burger isn't people."
WILLOW,"They aren't even meat, it's all processed vegetables. Isn't that weird?"
WILLOW,"Buffy, there's more. Something happened today ... i-it wasn't my fault. It was Amy's fault, but I feel so bad about it."
WILLOW (O.S.),"It was Amy's power, but, but it felt like I was doing everything myself. And I couldn't stop. And now it's gone and I feel kinda shaky and ... like I, I need it ... Buffy?"
WILLOW,"(alarmed) Buffy, something fell."
WILLOW,Buffy!
WIG LADY,Visitors! How nice.
WILLOW,Missed me.
WILLOW,Buffy!
WILLOW,"Buffy, are you all right?"
BUFFY,"Para...lyzed, but ... I think it's wearing off."
WILLOW,"(smiling) I did it! I killed it, Buffy, look!"
BUFFY/WILLOW,Ewwwww.
Cut to,"next day. Bright sunny morning. Amy walks down the sidewalk and up the walk to the Summers house, rings the doorbell."
AMY,(cheerful) Hey.
WILLOW,(not moving aside) Amy.
AMY,"Can I come in? My new place isn't set up, and I wanted to borrow some stuff like detergent."
WILLOW,You really can't.
AMY,"I can't borrow detergent? Well, when they start calling me 'stinky Amy,' I'm just gonna say, 'hey, not my fault...'"
WILLOW,I can't spend time with you anymore.
AMY,What?
WILLOW,You can't come in here again.
AMY,"What's up, y-you didn't like your birthday present?"
WILLOW,That's right.
AMY,"You're telling me that you didn't have a genuine blast? Come on, that was a sweet spell. That was like a trip to Disneyland without the lines."
WILLOW,"You don't get it. What you did to me was wrong. Do you have any idea how much harder that makes, just, everything?"
AMY,You know what I notice? You're not denying that you had fun.
WILLOW,Shut up.
AMY,"Oh, yeah. Sharp argument you got there. Were you on the debate team? I forget. I forgot a lot while you were failing to make me be not a rat."
WILLOW,Amy. If you really are my friend ... you better stay away from me. And if you really aren't...
WILLOW,(meaningfully) ...you *better* stay away from me.
Cut to,"interior of the DoubleMeat Palace, employee lounge. Buffy walks in holding a bundle of folded clothing, walks over to the manager's office."
LORRAINE,Yeah?
BUFFY,"Hi. Uh, you must be the new manager. I-I'm Buffy Summers."
LORRAINE,I'm Lorraine Ross. They called me in when Manny did his disappearing act. You hear about that? Guy just disappeared.
BUFFY,Yeah. I think ... I think that used to happen a lot around here.
LORRAINE,Buffy Summers. I heard about you. Caused a big scene.
BUFFY,"Oh, yeah. Practical jokes not really right for the workplace. I so get that now. Anyway, I just wanted to return my uniform. (hands it over)"
LORRAINE,Oh. Most people don't even bother.
BUFFY,The DoubleMeat Medley ... is vegetables?
LORRAINE,How do you know that?
BUFFY,So I guess it's true.
LORRAINE,"Um, close the door? (Buffy does) Have a seat."
LORRAINE,"It's a formed and texturized vegetable-based meat-like product, suitable for grinding. It's blended with large amounts of rendered beef fat for flavor."
BUFFY,"Wait, the secret ingredient in the beef is ... beef?"
LORRAINE,"Buffy. You know something powerful here, do you understand that? The DoubleMeat reputation is built on a foundation of ... well, meat. You can't spread this around."
BUFFY,"I get that. (pauses to consider) It's a valuable secret, isn't it?"
LORRAINE,Is there something you want?
BUFFY,I really need money.
LORRAINE,You want money?
BUFFY,"No! Well, I mean, yes, but, but no, I ... well, I, I want to work. See, I-I have zero money coming in, and there are expenses, and by the time I interview for a new job and get hired and go through a training process, it... well, I'd ... I'd really like to not be fired anymore."
LORRAINE,"(small smile) Well, I don't want any more practical jokes. I mean it."
BUFFY,I promise.
LORRAINE,"Well, I'm a little short-handed right now, and you're already trained ... (smiles) I think you can not be fired."
BUFFY,"(relieved) Thank you. That's, that's great. And I can do the job, I promise that too."
LORRAINE,"I certainly hope so. I don't like short-timers, Buffy. I like people who *want* to be here. Maybe you didn't take this job seriously before, but from now on?"
LORRAINE,See this? I want you to be shooting for this from here on out.
BUFFY,Right. Here on out.
