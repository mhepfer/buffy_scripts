character,dialogue
Xander,You don't know what you're talking about.
Willow,"Xander, he was obviously in charge."
Xander,He was a puppet! She was using him!
Willow,He didn't seem like the type of guy who would let himself be  used.
Xander,"Well, that was her genius! He didn't even know he was playing  second fiddle. (turns behind him) Buffy."
Buffy,Huh?
Xander,"Who was the real power? The Captain, or Tennille?"
Buffy,Ummm... Who are these people?
Xander,"The Captain and Tennille? Boy, somebody was raised in a  culture-free environment!"
Buffy,I'm sorry. I was just...
Willow,Thinking?
Buffy,"No, not thinking. Having a lot of happy non-thoughts. I love it  when things are quiet around here."
Xander,"Yeah, with Spike and Drusilla out of the way, we've really been  ridin' the mellow, and I am really jinxing the hell out of us by saying  that."
Buffy,"Yeah, but we'll let you off this time."
Willow,"So, we're pretty sure that there're not more Tarakan assassins  coming our way?"
Buffy,Angel's sources say the contract's off.
Xander,How *is* Angel? Pretend I care.
Buffy,(smiles) Getting better.
Willow,And you're loving playing nursemaid?
Buffy,"Oh, yeah!"
Xander,"So, is it better than playing naughty stewardess?"
Buffy,Xander...
Buffy,You guys wait here a second.
Joyce,(from the kitchen) No!
Buffy,Mom!
Buffy,"Oh, my... (exhales) I'm sorry, I... (exhales) I heard..."
Joyce,"Uh, I-I-I broke a wineglass. Y-y-you're home early."
Ted,Hi.
Buffy,Hi.
Joyce,"(to Ted) Oh! Uh, this is my daughter, Buffy. (to Buffy) Buffy,  this is Ted."
Ted,"Okay, here we go!"
Buffy,So. All these late nights at the gallery recently I gather you  were cataloging more than art.
Joyce,"Well, I... I've been looking for the right moment to introduce  you two. He's a wonderful man."
Ted,Sprinkle that on...
Xander,"Uh, a little more. Okay, more..."
Buffy,How'd you meet?
Joyce,"Oh, he sells, uh, computer software. He redid my entire system  at the gallery, freed up a lot of my time."
Buffy,To meet new people. And smooch them in my kitchen.
Joyce,You weren't supposed to see that.
Willow,I like my new nine-Gig hard drive.
Ted,"But you don't love it, 'cause without the DMA upgrade your  computer's only half a rocket ship."
Willow,"Yeah, but who can afford the upgrades?"
Ted,"Well, you can! I get the demos for free, I don't see why I  shouldn't give 'em to you for the same price! Any friend of Buffy's..."
Ted,What?
Xander,"Oh, that's the sound she makes when she's speechless with  geeker joy. Can I just say, this is the finest pizza *ever* on God's  green Earth. What is your secret?"
Ted,"Well, after you bake it, you fry it in herbs and olive oil, but  you gotta use (knocks his pan) a cast-iron skillet. No room for  compromise there."
Xander,"Y'know, you should market these things. I mean, you can get  two, three hundred bucks apiece!"
Ted,Hungry?
Buffy,"No, thanks."
Ted,"Buffy, I want to apologize. That wasn't how I wanted us to meet. I  wanted it to be... perfect. I'm very fond of your mother, I guess that's  pretty obvious. I know you're the most (gestures toward the picture of  the two of them on the refrigerator) important thing in her life, and,  well, gosh, that makes you pretty important to me, too."
Joyce,"Buffy, I really want you to be okay with this."
Ted,Beg to differ: *we* really want you to be okay with this.
Buffy,I'm okay.
Joyce,You are?
Buffy,I am. (smiles stiffly)
Giles,"Buffy? I-I believe he's, he's, um..."
Giles,"It, it's, it's staking time, really. Don't you think?"
Buffy,Any others?
Giles,"Well, for their sakes, I certainly hope not."
Buffy,"What? I kill vampires, that's my job."
Giles,"Well, true, true, although you don't usually beat them into  quite such a bloody pulp beforehand. Everything alright?"
Buffy,Yeah! Fine!
Buffy,I killed a vampire here on Wednesday. Why are they hanging out  at the park?
Giles,"Well, they're... scattered, you know. Now their leaders are  gone, with any luck dead. In times of crisis they usually return to the  easiest feeding grounds."
Buffy,Vampires are creeps.
Giles,"Yes, that's why one slays them."
Buffy,"I mean, people are perfectly happy getting along, and then  vampires come, and they run around and they kill people, and they take  over your whole house, they start making these stupid little mini  pizzas, and everyone's like, 'I like your mini pizzas,' but I'm telling  you, I am..."
Giles,"(interrupts) Uh, uh, Buffy! I-I believe the... subtext here is,  is, rapidly becoming, uh, (clears his throat) uh, text. Are you sure  there's nothing you want to share?"
Buffy,No. Forget it. (looks around again) Think there'll be any more?  I-I can wait.
Buffy,"If you say one more word, things will become dire."
Xander,"Did you even bother to taste 'em? Nooo! Well, I did, and I'm  here to tell ya those mini pizzas have changed my life! Ted is the  master chef!"
Buffy,"Fine! So he's a good cook. Well, what does that really tell you  about a person?"
Xander,Everything.
Willow,You don't like him?
Buffy,"I don't *know* him. I, I mean, so far all I see is someone who  apparently has a good job, seems nice and polite, and my mother really  likes him."
Xander,(in a rough voice) What kind of a monster is he?
Buffy,I'm just saying there's something a little too clean about this  clown.
Willow,(giggles) He's a clean clown! (gets stares from the others) I  have my own fun.
Xander,"Buff, you're lacking evidence. I think maybe we're in Sigmund  Freud territory."
Willow,"He has a point. Separation anxiety, the mother figure being  taken away, conflict with the father figure..."
Buffy,He's *not* my father figure.
Xander,Having issues much?
Buffy,I am not!
Xander,"You're having parental issues, you're having parental issues..."
Willow,Xander...
Xander,What? Freud would've said the exact same thing. Except he might  not have done that little dance.
Buffy,"Okay, I admit it's weird. Seeing my mother frenching a guy is  definitely a ticket to therapy land, but it's more than that. I'm pretty  good at sensing what's going on around me, and there is definitely  something wrong with this... Ted."
Xander,Ted!
Buffy,"Of course, Ted. Who'd you think I was talking about?"
Xander,"Hi, Ted! Ted, who's here."
Ted,"Hello, kids!"
Buffy,(to Ted) What are you doing here?
Ted,"I'm updating the software in the guidance office. Which reminds  me, (pulls several disks from his pocket and hands them to Willow) your  upgrades."
Willow,"(eagerly accepting the disks) Oh, what a day! Thank you!"
Ted,"Think nothing of it. Buffy, do you like miniature golf?"
Xander,Who doesn't!
Ted,"Well, your mother and I were thinking maybe this Saturday we could  drag the three of you out to the course, spend some time swinging the  iron with the stuffy old people."
Buffy,"Well, uh..."
Ted,I'm making a picnic basket.
Xander,(eyes wide) With mini pizzas?
Ted,And cookies!
Buffy,"You know what, we, we would love to, honestly, but, um,  unfortunately we have that (looks to Willow for support) thing on  Saturday."
Willow,"Ohhh, that thing. (they look at Xander) That thing."
Xander,"Hey, we can do that thing anytime. I'm tired of doing that  thing. (to Ted) We're on!"
Ted,Great!
Giles,"Hello, Jenny."
Jenny,Rupert. Hi.
Giles,"Some of your, uh, textbooks were delivered to the library. Um,  do you want me to, uh, hang on to them?"
Jenny,"Yeah, that's fine. I'll send the kids by to pick 'em up."
Giles,Right. Good. (turns around and starts out of the room)
Jenny,Pretty flimsy excuse for coming by to see me.
Giles,"(comes back in) You should have heard the ones I threw out.  (smiles briefly) I just, I wanted to, uh... see how you were doing."
Jenny,"I'm doing pretty good, actually. I've stayed out of mortal  danger for three whole weeks. I could get used to it. (Giles smiles at  that) I'm still having trouble sleeping, though."
Giles,"(steps closer) Oh, of course. Um... you, you, you need time."
Jenny,"Or possibly space. Rupert, I know you're concerned. But having  you constantly poking around, making little puppy dog eyes at me,  wondering if I'm okay... (exhales) You make me feel bad that I don't  feel better. I don't want that responsibility."
Giles,"Sorry. (looks down) I certainly don't mean to make, um, 'dog  eyes'... at you. I'm just..."
Jenny,Worried. I know.
Giles,I shouldn't have bothered you.
Buffy,"So mom's like, 'Do you think Ted will like this?' and 'This is  Ted's favorite show,' and 'Ted's teaching me computers,' and 'Ted said  the funniest thing,' and I'm like, 'That's really great, Mom,' and then  she said I was being sarcastic, which I was, but I'm sorry if I don't  wanna talk about Ted all the time."
Angel,"(looks up at her) So, you gonna talk about something else at  some point?"
Buffy,"I'm sorry. I just have so much to deal with, I don't need some  new guy in my life."
Angel,"No, but maybe your mom does."
Buffy,"Well, sure, if you're gonna use wisdom."
Angel,(chuckles) Loneliness is about the scariest thing there is.
Buffy,"Okay, so my mom needs a guy in her life. Does it have to be Ted?"
Angel,Do you have somebody else in mind? There's a guy out there that  would satisfy you?
Buffy,"My dad? (Angel looks at her) Yeah, okay, that's not gonna  happen. Fine, fine, I'll give Ted a chance. I'll play mini-golf, and  I'll smile and curtsy and be the dutiful daughter. Do I have to like  him?"
Angel,(smiles) Kiss me.
Buffy,"(smiles) Finally, something I wanna do!"
Xander,"Ah, the dreaded five-par cuckoo clock. Ha! So many have come,  so few have conquered."
Joyce,That picnic was delicious.
Joyce,You know how rare it is to find a man that cooks?
Ted,"I know I've been looking a long time for one. So, Buffy, I bet the  boys are lined up around the block tryin' to get a date with you."
Buffy,Not really.
Willow,"Oh, they are, but she's only interested in... (gets a nudge  from Buffy) uh, her studies! 'Book-cracker Buffy', it's kind of her  nickname."
Ted,"Well, glad to hear it. I bet that means your grades will be  picking up soon."
Buffy,My grades? (paces over to her mom) How does he know about my  grades?
Joyce,"I told him. He wants to know everything about you. He's  concerned. That's a good thing. (Ted makes his shot) Ooo, nice shot,  Ted!"
Ted,Keep your eye on the ball. Watch those elbows!
Ted,"Oh! Bad luck, little lady!"
Joyce,"Oh, we won't count it."
Ted,We won't?
Joyce,"Well, it's just miniature golf."
Ted,"It is, but the rules are the rules. And what we teach her is what  she takes out into the world when we're not there, whether it's at  school or an unchaperoned party. (to Buffy) I don't mean to overstep my  bounds, this is between you and your mother, I just think right is  right."
Joyce,He has a point.
Buffy,Fine. I'll just go hit my ball from the rough.
Buffy,"(loudly) Hey, how 'bout that! Got a hole in two!"
Ted,Beg to differ.
Buffy,"Okay, so fine my score or whatever."
Ted,"I think you're missing the point here, little lady. Right is  right, wrong is wrong. Why don't people see that?"
Buffy,It's just a game?
Ted,"Right, it's just a game, do your own thing, well, I'm not wired  that way. And I am here to tell you (Buffy notices how he's tapping his  ankle with his club pretty hard) it is *not* a game! It *does* count,  and I don't stand for that kind of malarkey in my house!"
Buffy,Then I guess it's a good thing I'm not *in* your house.
Ted,Do you want me to slap that smart-ass mouth of yours?
Ted,Who's up for dessert? I made chocolate-chip cookies! (smiles)
Xander,Yum-my!
Willow,Cookies!
Ted,"Yeah! I-I made, uh, too many, so you guys are gonna have to take  some home!"
Joyce,"Mm! Buffy, you've got to try one of these! They're really good!  Mm!"
Willow,Mm!
Xander,Mm! These are tasty!
Joyce,"Good morning, sunshine!"
Buffy,Hey.
Joyce,"(sets down the OJ) I've got juice, I've got sticky buns, oh,  don't they smell good!"
Joyce,Ted made them.
Joyce,(smiles) What?
Buffy,I'd just like to eat something around here that Ted didn't make.
Joyce,"Oh, what kind of an attitude is that?"
Buffy,"(exhales) Look, Mom, I know you think he's great and all, but  I..."
Joyce,"(pours some juice) Y'know, he went out of his way to be nice to  you, and you couldn't say two words to him on Saturday. (pours another  glass) I do not expect you to love him right away like I do, but I do  expect you to treat him decently."
Buffy,You love him?
Joyce,"(puts down the juice carton) I-I don't know. (exhales) That just  slipped out. (takes the juice back to the fridge) But I guess, I mean,  it's not exactly like men beat down the door when you're a single..."
Buffy,When you're a single parent.
Joyce,"(exhales) Honey, look. I wouldn't have anything to do with  anybody if they didn't care about you. But he does! I don't understand  why you can't see that!"
Buffy,He threatened me.
Joyce,What? (comes back to the island)
Buffy,He threatened me. He said that he was gonna slap my face.
Joyce,"(disbelieving) He said no such thing! Honey, Ted told me what  happened. He caught you cheating, didn't he?"
Buffy,"(exhales) Yeah, I kicked my ball in, put me in jail, but he  totally wigged!"
Joyce,"And he didn't say anything about it in front of the others, did  he?"
Buffy,"Uh, no, but I don't think that's the..."
Joyce,"(interrupts) Well, I thought that that was pretty decent of him!  Ted said we are just gonna have to give you time to come around. Oh,  speaking of which, he's making dinner for us tonight, so I'd like you at  home, please, (points down for emphasis) promptly at six."
Joyce,"Mm, this is sooo delicious!"
Willow,"What do you mean, check him out?"
Buffy,"I mean investigate him. Find out his secrets, hack into his  life."
Xander,Can you say 'overreaction'?
Buffy,Can you say 'sucking chest wound'?
Willow,"Buffy, it just seems like you *want* him to be corrupt, or  something."
Buffy,The guy lost his senses over mini-golf.
Xander,"So he's a little uptight. Last I heard that's not a slaying  offense. (gets a look from Buffy) Don't gimme the look, I'm on your  side. I'm just saying there are some things in life you have to accept."
Buffy,And I'm saying Ted ain't one of 'em.
Xander,"Hey, Cordy! Nice outfit."
Cordelia,"(stops to look at him) Oh, very funny."
Xander,Not really.
Cordelia,What are you saying?
Xander,Nice outfit?
Cordelia,"Well, why don't you just keep your mouth shut! (walks off)"
Xander,Would you guys excuse me for a sec? (goes after Cordelia)
Willow,What's up with them?
Cordelia,What's wrong with you?
Xander,I gave you a compliment.
Cordelia,In front of your friends! They're gonna know!
Xander,Know what?
Cordelia,Please! It's too traumatic for me to even say it!
Xander,That we kissed?
Cordelia,Uhhh!
Xander,"Look, I'm not gonna tell, they're not gonna know. Not your  friends, not my friends. You wanna go to the utility closet and make  out?"
Cordelia,God! Is that all you ever think about? (considers the offer)  Okay.
Buffy,"Will, I'm not wrong here. Ted has a problem with me. He acts  like I'm in the way or something. And Mom's been totally different since  he's around."
Willow,"Different, like happy?"
Buffy,Like Stepford. Will you help me?
Willow,You know I will. What do you want me to look for?
Buffy,Let's start small. Can you find out where he works?
Neal,"Yeah, i-i-it's a terrific product. No PC should be without it."
Ted,"No, Mrs. Lawnsdale, it is not an inexpensive piece of software. As  a matter of fact it's a very expensive one. Which removes the risk of  crashing your whole system. Of course, if you prefer something cheap, I  can always recommend... Trust me, you won't be sorry. Thank *you* very  much."
Ted,Goin' to lunch!
Neal,"You're new, aren't ya? (grabs the coffee pot)"
Buffy,Oh...
Neal,I'm Neal. (pours a cup)
Buffy,"I'm B... Linda. Belinda. I'm just temping for the day. (looks at  the board) Wow, that guy's a salesman. I guess he's the one to beat  around here."
Neal,"Nobody beats 'The Machine'. The guy's a genius. Knows everything  about computers, never loses a client... If I sound bitter, I am. (takes  a sip of his coffee)"
Buffy,"Well, nobody likes an overachiever. (Neal chuckles) Uh, he's  probably got ex-wives and, and families to support."
Neal,He's just got a girlfriend. I'm amazed he let her clutter his  desk.
Neal,Thank God he's taking off for the wedding.
Buffy,(surprised) The wedding?
Neal,"Yeah, he's got it set for two months from now. Believe me, I am  counting the days. (spots his boss) Uh-oh, the ueber-boss. Back to the  salt mines. (walks off)"
Ted,"We thank you for what we are about to receive, and we ask that you  bless this house, and help the people in it to be more productive, more  considerate and more honest. Amen."
Joyce,Amen.
Ted,"Well, another great day at work! How was school today, Buffy? Did  you learn anything?"
Buffy,Quite a bit.
Ted,"Good for you! Well, Joycie, what do you think?"
Joyce,I think every home should have one of you. It's fantastic!  (smiles) (to Buffy) Don't you think?
Buffy,Looks good.
Ted,"Well, you know, little lady, it's not just for looks, it's for  building strong bodies."
Joyce,(looks at Buffy) Honey?
Buffy,Are you two engaged?
Joyce,"Goodness, no! Whatever gave you that idea?"
Ted,"Now, Joycie, let me handle this. Buffy, your mother and I are  taking it one step at a time. And if things go the way I hope, maybe  someday soon I just might ask her to tie the knot. How would you feel  about that? (silence from Buffy) It's okay to have feelings, Buffy, and  it's okay to express them."
Buffy,I'd feel like killing myself.
Joyce,Buffy!
Ted,"No, no, I, I told her to be honest. (to Buffy) Sweetheart, you  should try and get used to me, 'cause you know what? I'm not going  anywhere."
Buffy,(to Joyce) May I be excused?
Joyce,"You can go to your room, young lady, that's where you can go."
Joyce,"Ted, I (exhales) I am so embarrassed! I-I-I don't know what's  wrong with her!"
Ted,"Joycie, (takes her hand) you don't get to be salesman of the year  by giving up after a couple of rejections. She'll come 'round."
Buffy,"Vampires... Here, vampires..."
Buffy,What are you doing in here?
Ted,"Your mother told you to go to your room, Buffy. You and I both  know she didn't mean climb out a window and go gallivanting about town."
Buffy,"First of all, this is *my* room, second... (sees her Slayer  stuff lying on her desk) You've been going through my things?"
Ted,"Yes, I have."
Buffy,That's my personal property! How *dare* you?!
Ted,"I don't see how it's any different from you snooping around my  office, do you? (raises her diary and reads) What exactly is a Vampire  Slayer?"
Buffy,It's none of your business.
Ted,"Beg to differ, little lady. Everything you do is nothing *but* my  business from now on."
Buffy,I think you better get out of here. Now!
Ted,"Or what? (stands up and steps toward her) You'll slay me? I'm  real. I'm not some goblin you made up in your little diary.  Psychiatrists have a word for something like this: delusional. So, from  now on, you'll do what I say, when I say, or I show this (holds up her  diary) to your mother, and you'll spend your best dating years behind  the wall of a mental institution. Your mother and I are going to be  happy. You're not going to stand in the way. Sleep tight!"
Buffy,"That's mine, and you are *not* leaving this room with it!"
Ted,Take your hand off me.
Buffy,No.
Buffy,Ohhh! (straightens back up to face him) I was *so* hoping you'd  do that.
Joyce,Buffy! Stop that!
Joyce,Stop it!
Joyce,Ted...
Joyce,Ted! Ted!
Joyce,You killed him!
Joyce,"We were, uh, seeing each other."
Joyce,"He fell. Down the stairs, he fell."
Buffy,I hit him.
Buffy,I hit him.
Buffy,He was in my room. And we got into an argument.
Buffy,"He, um..."
Buffy,"(looks up) No. He threatened me. He, he said that he would slap  me."
Buffy,"No. But he had my diary, and I-I tried to take it back, a-and  that's when he hit me."
Buffy,I don't bruise easily.
Buffy,Yes.
Buffy,I told you...
Buffy,"What do you want? I-I told you what happened, I didn't mean to!"
Joyce,Are you charging her with something?
Xander,Buffy!
Xander,Are you okay?
Willow,How come you're here?
Buffy,I couldn't stay at home. (she and Willow sit) Mom won't even  look at me.
Willow,What happened? Unless you don't want to talk about it.
Buffy,We had a fight and I lost my temper. I really let him have it.
Willow,The paper said he fell.
Buffy,He fell. Hard.
Xander,What was he?
Buffy,What?
Xander,"What was he? A-a demon? A giant bug? Some kind of dark god  with the secrets of nouvelle cuisine? I mean, we are talking creature- feature here, right?"
Xander,Oh man!
Willow,But I'm sure it wasn't your fault. He started it.
Buffy,"Yeah. That defense only works in six-year-old court, Will."
Xander,Court? Wa-wait. Are they charging you with something?
Buffy,(shakes her head) I-I don't know. Not yet.
Buffy,"(eyes down) He was a person, and I killed him."
Willow,Don't say that!
Buffy,(looks up at Willow) Why not? Everyone else is. And it's the  truth.
Xander,It was an accident.
Buffy,I'm the Slayer. I had no right to hit him like that.
Xander,"Look, Buffy, I don't know what happened exactly. But I do know  you. And I know you would never hurt anyone intentionally. Well, you  know, unless..."
Buffy,Unless they were dating my mother?
Buffy,I gotta go.
Giles,Buffy?
Giles,Are you alright?
Giles,"Oh, uh, stupid question, I'm sorry. Look, i-i-if there's  anything you need, of course, just, just ask."
Buffy,(notices the man guarding the door) What's going on? (walks  toward the classroom)
Giles,"Oh, you needn't worry about that. They're just asking a few  questions, your, your, your behavior and... um... uh..."
Giles,"Of course, I told them you, uh... I..."
Xander,"Man, this is killing me! That bastard was up to something, I  know it. If I could just get my hands on him..."
Xander,Earlier this week.
Cordelia,I thought you liked him.
Xander,"(steps over to her) I sometimes like things that are not good  for me. Besides, no way, no how does Buffy put the big hurt on an  innocent man. Nice Uncle Ted was dirty."
Willow,"We've gotta prove that somehow. Xander, do you have a pen?"
Xander,"If Buffy has to go to jail because of that creep I'm gonna lose  it. He's gotta be in there, Will. Uh, history of domestic violence, a  criminal record? (finds a zip-lock bag) Ooo! Cookies!"
Cordelia,I don't get it. Buffy's the Slayer. Shouldn't she have...
Xander,"What, a license to kill? (takes a bite of a cookie)"
Cordelia,"Well, not for fun. But she's like this superman. Shouldn't  there be different rules for her?"
Willow,"Sure, in a fascist society."
Cordelia,Right! Why can't we have one of those?
Willow,Buffy's not going to jail. It's not fair.
Giles,"(comes back) Whatever the authorities have planned for her, it  can't be much worse than what she's doing to herself. (adds an ax and  other stuff to the bag) She's taken a human life. The guilt, it-it's,  it's pretty hard to bear, and it won't go away soon."
Cordelia,"I guess you should know, since you helped raise that demon  that killed that guy that time?"
Giles,Yes. Do let's bring that up as often as possible. (heads back to  the cage)
Xander,"So, Giles, you takin' over tonight? (takes another bite of his  cookie)"
Giles,"Um, well, Buffy's not in any shape to patrol. (comes back to the  table) The least I can do is pick up the slack. Someone has to. (adds  several crosses to the bag)"
Willow,"Giles, you shouldn't go out there without the Slayer."
Giles,"Until Buffy regains her equilibrium, there *is* no Slayer."
Cordelia,If you need help...
Giles,"No, uh, Buffy needs your help more than I. You carry on  investigating, see if you can find out as much about this Buchanan chap  as possible. (takes up the bag to go)"
Willow,Be careful.
Giles,I-I will. (leaves)
Willow,Ted's got no criminal record! Damn! This guy's like citizen of  the year!
Xander,Don't sweat it. It'll be fine.
Willow,Don't sweat it?
Xander,"Yeah, cute buddy! (goes over to her) We'll work it out!  (ruffles her hair) No worries!"
Cordelia,What happened to 'this is killing me'?
Xander,(shakes his cookie at Cordelia) Worrying isn't gonna solve any  problems.
Buffy,Can I help?
Joyce,"It's done. I've been meaning to clean out this junk for months.  Do you, uh, have homework?"
Buffy,I didn't mean to hurt him.
Joyce,I don't wanna talk about this.
Buffy,"Mom, please, you have to know..."
Joyce,"I can't, not yet. Please, Buffy, just go to your room."
Willow,Okay!
Xander,What do we know?
Willow,"Well, apparently the secret ingredient (looks up from the  scope) is not love."
Xander,What is it then?
Willow,"I'm not positive, but I think it's Dematorin. It's like a  tranquilizer, keeps you all mellow and compliant. It also shares a few  components with Ecstasy."
Xander,"This is evidence! This is real evidence that Ted was some kind  of a crook! Buffy's cleared! Willow, you are the best human ever! I  adore you!"
Xander,"Well, that's the cookies talkin', but you rock!"
Cordelia,"(comes into the lab) Well, your search finally hit pay dirt.  You got some personal records, marriage certificates and an address.  (puts the printouts on the table)"
Xander,"Well, let's check it out, get our Slayer back on her feet  before somebody else gets hurt."
Giles,Ah!
Jenny,"Yeah, I get that reaction from men all the time."
Giles,Jenny! What are you doing here?
Jenny,I saw your car back there. I wanted to apologize.
Giles,"Well, now is... not the best time to go ta..."
Jenny,"No, no, please, please, lemme just, lemme get this out.  (exhales) I was sooo... harsh the other day. I am so sorry. I mean, I  know how badly you must feel about putting me in danger before, and..."
Giles,(looks past her) Right in harm's view now.
Buffy,Mom? (silence) (exhales) The hell with this.
Buffy,"She nailed it shut. Well, it's official, this day can't get any  worse."
Ted,Beg to differ.
Buffy,You died.
Ted,"That's right, little lady, you killed me. Do we have something to  say about that? Are we sorry?"
Buffy,What are you?
Ted,I'm a salesman! That's what you should've remembered. No matter  how you put him down...
Ted,...a good salesman always bounces back!
Giles,(to Jenny) MY BAG!
Ted,"You see I had to shut down for a while to get you off my back. You  should've seen the intern's face when I got up off the table, it was a  hoot! Fun's over, though."
Jenny,"Say good night, big guy!"
Giles,AHHH!
Jenny,"OH, GOD!"
Jenny,"Oh, no!"
Vampire,"(laughs) Nice shot, lady!"
Ted,"That wasn't playing fair, missy!"
Ted,You're gonna find...
Ted,Hell of a day! Makes you feel like you're eighteen again! (his  head jerks back) ...that I don't like being disobeyed!
Ted,Don't worry about me and your mother. We're gonna be very happy!
Willow,Careful!
Xander,Let's look around.
Cordelia,I'll take the back.
Xander,Check for cookies.
Xander,For evidence!
Willow,So far I've counted four marriage certificates.
Xander,(looks at some shelves) Any divorce papers?
Willow,Not a one.
Xander,"So either our boy was a Mormon, or..."
Willow,"(notices) Whoa, whoa, 1957! Ted musta married young! Like pre- school young."
Cordelia,"(comes from the back) Nothing interesting back here. Doesn't  look like anybody's worked here, let alone lived here."
Xander,Something's missing here. This doesn't seem like Ted at all.
Cordelia,"(looks down) Yeah, and this rug? It doesn't go with the rest  of the decor."
Joyce,"Oh. Buffy, I'm sorry... (exhales) I know you didn't mean to..."
Ted,Joyce?
Joyce,(whispers) Ted! Is it really you? But you were...
Ted,(steps into the kitchen) I'm okay! I'm okay.
Joyce,I-I don't understand this! You were dead!
Ted,They said I must've been dead for six minutes. They said any  longer and it would've caused brain damage.
Joyce,"Oh, why didn't they tell us?"
Ted,"Nobody knew! They took me to the morgue. I was unconscious for  almost a day. An intern found me. It's a miracle, Joyce. A miracle."
Joyce,"Oh, Ted!"
Ted,I know.
Joyce,"(lets go) Oh, my God, Buffy! Oh, Ted, I swear... she never meant  to hurt you. You have to believe me."
Ted,You don't have to worry about Buffy. (Joyce leans on him) You  don't have to worry about anything. Daddy's here.
Cordelia,Feels like home. If it's the fifties and you're a psycho.
Xander,"Whatcha got in the closet, Ted?"
Xander,Let's go.
Cordelia,But we need evidence!
Xander,We got it.
Willow,What's in there?
Xander,His first four wives.
Ted,"You know what brought me back, Joyce? It was you. I couldn't go  into that light. I had to come back for you. I'm gonna make you so  happy!"
Joyce,(smiles) You should sit down.
Ted,I feel fine! Never better! (smiles)
Joyce,"(exhales) Ted, I think I should talk to Buffy first. Before she  sees you, 'cause I'm sure she's..."
Ted,(angry) Do we have to worry about Buffy right now? How about  worrying about Teddy? He's the one who died!
Joyce,"(taken aback) I-I-I'm, I'm sorry, I just... I... (exhales) I-I  don't know what to do!"
Ted,Don't I always tell you what to do? I'm going to make things  right. Then you and I... (shorts and jerks his head right) Want a little  gravy with that? (jerks his head back) ...can go away where no one will  bother us again.
Joyce,"(looking worried) Ted, I, I think you might wanna rest for  awhile."
Ted,(angry) I think you might wanna stop telling me what to do! I  don't take orders from women! I'm not wired that way!
Jenny,"Oh, God, I am so sorry!"
Giles,I think I'm alright.
Jenny,"No, you're just in shock."
Giles,"No, no, really, I, uh, I don't think it went in too deep. The...  advantages of layers of tweed. Better than kevlar."
Jenny,"(squeamish) Oh, okay, alright, we have to get you to the  hospital."
Giles,"Yes, yes."
Jenny,C'mon.
Giles,Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh!
Jenny,Sorry! Sorry!
Giles,"Let's move slowly, shall we?"
Jenny,Sorry! Okay...
Jenny,Okay...
Giles,What? Wha-what is it?
Jenny,"Some night, huh? (Giles smirks) Yeah, you really know how to woo  a girl back, don't cha?"
Giles,(laughs) Ow! Ow!
Jenny,Hospital.
Giles,Yes.
Joyce,"I-I think I could use a drink. (looks at Ted) Um, to-to-to  celebrate! (stops walking)"
Ted,We should probably be hitting the road.
Joyce,Hitting the road?
Ted,You're going to love the house. It's furnished just the way you  like it. I spent a lot of... (shorts and jerks right) ...telling me what  to do! (jerks back) ...time decorating.
Joyce,"(making an excuse to go) Well, then I'd, I'd probably better go  pack."
Ted,"(takes her arm) I already have your clothes. They're your size,  they're always your size. You left me once, but I keep bringing you  back. Husband and wife is forever. (shorts) Forever."
Ted,(holding her arm) Let's go.
Joyce,"Ted, let go, please. (he doesn't) Get off me! (jerks her arm  away)"
Ted,Fine then. I'll have to carry you.
Ted,"Buffy, come out! I don't stand for this kind of malarkey in my  house!"
Buffy,Uncle Teddy?
Buffy,This house is mine!
Ted,Buffy? How about a nice game of Parcheesi?
Joyce,Do you wanna rent a movie tonight?
Buffy,Sounds like fun.
Joyce,Just nothing with horror in it. Or romance. Or men.
Buffy,I guess we're 'Thelma and Louise'ing it again.
Joyce,Mm-hm. Good call. (munches) I still think he's gonna jump out at  me. Especially after what the police found in his house. It's just too  horrible.
Buffy,I wouldn't worry. He's not coming back.
Joyce,I wish I could be so sure.
Buffy,Trust me. He's on the scrap heap. (gets a look) Of life.
Xander,"So, I'm Ted, the sickly loser. I'm dying and my wife dumps me.  I build a better Ted. He brings her back, holds her hostage in his  bunker'o'love until she dies. And then he keeps bringing her back, over  and over. Now, now that's creepy on a level I hardly knew existed."
Willow,The sad part is the real Ted must've been a genius. There were  design features in that robot that pre-date...
Buffy,"(interrupts) Willow, tell me you didn't keep any parts."
Willow,Not any big ones.
Buffy,"Oh, Will, you're supposed to use your powers for good!"
Willow,I just wanna learn stuff.
Cordelia,Like how to build your own serial killer?
Xander,"Uh, it's so hard to rent one nowadays."
Cordelia,Can we just drop the subject?
Buffy,Absolutely. I plan to forget the whole thing and pick up right  where we left off.
Buffy,Okay! That's it! I give up! Do I have to sound an air horn every  time I walk into a room?
Buffy,"I mean, what is it with grownups these days?"
