GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer...</I>
AMY,All right! You wanna fry a witch? I'll give you a witch! Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!
WILLOW,"She's a perfectly normal girl. Then, she's a rat."
BUFFY,Maybe we should get her one of those wheel thingies.
TARA,"Can, can we not do this now?"
WILLOW,Forget it ever happened.
WILLOW,Forget.
TARA,What is wrong with you? I know you used that spell on me.
WILLOW,I'll go a month without doing any magic.
TARA,Go a week.
WILLOW,"Fine, that's easy!"
WILLOW,"When the fire goes out, when the crystal turns black, the spell will be cast."
TARA,I don't think this is gonna work.
WILLOW,Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
SPIKE,I'm placing an order.
WARREN,"Oh no no, I'm not making any more girls."
SPIKE,Sure you are. Here's your specs.
WARREN,So ... you guys wanna team up and take over Sunnydale?
JONATHAN/ANDREW,Okay.
WARREN,The Trio versus the Slayer.
JONATHAN,We're like supervillains.
BUFFY,I can't do this without you.
GILES,You can. That's why I'm going.
GILES,I'm heading back to England.
GILES,...and I plan to stay.
SPIKE,We have to talk.
BUFFY,About what?
SPIKE,"We kissed, Buffy."
HUSBAND,(nervous) I'm sure we can work something out.
WIFE,A deal of some sort. Anything you want.
BUFFY,(OS) I always wanted a pony.
BUFFY,"Oh. You weren't really speaking to me, were you? My bad. Well, as long as I'm here..."
BUFFY,(surprised) Wow. A mugging. Haven't gotten one of those in a while.
BUFFY,"Usually it's blood, and with the horror ... just a good old-fashioned mugging. (the victims staring at her) Kinda sweet actually."
BUFFY,"Oh, uh, probably not for you. Here. (gives the woman her purse) Go. Now."
BUFFY,"Not too sweet for you either, huh? (mugger getting up) But come on, rush me. It'll be funny."
SPIKE,Yaah!
BUFFY,No!
BUFFY,Gah! Oh!
BUFFY,What the hell are you doing?
SPIKE,I thought they were demons.
BUFFY,"Way to go with the keen observiness, Jessica Fletcher."
SPIKE,(glares) Remind me not to help you.
BUFFY,*More* often?
SPIKE,"Hey. Little sympathy for the man with the migraine here, can we?"
BUFFY,"Well, that's what you get for attacking a human."
SPIKE,"Yeah. (annoyed) You'd think if the government was gonna put a chip in my head, they'd at least make it so I could attack criminals and that sort."
BUFFY,"Yes, because muggers deserve to be eaten."
BUFFY,Just have to get your rocks off fightin' demons.
SPIKE,(suggestively) There are other ways.
BUFFY,"And to that, an extreme 'see you later.'"
SPIKE,Buffy.
BUFFY,"Spike ... it's late, okay, can we just finish this another time?"
SPIKE,"(walks closer) Oh, so you wanna jump right to the kissing then, eh?"
BUFFY,"I am not kissing you, Spike. Once was-"
SPIKE,Twice.
BUFFY,But not again.
SPIKE,"You're a tease, you know that, Slayer? (Buffy rolls her eyes, continues walking) Get a fellow's motor revving, let the tension marinate a couple-a days, then bam! Crown yourself the ice queen."
BUFFY,(still walking away) Need a few more metaphors for that little mix?
SPIKE,"(yells) It's only a matter of time before you realize I'm the only one here for you, pet. You got no one else!"
WILLOW,"What's the matter, Amy? You lonely? (opens the cage) Oh, we need to get you a nice companion rat (takes Amy out of the cage) that you can love ... play with ... and grow attached to, until one day they leave you for no good reason."
WILLOW,"Won't that be fun? (rat squeaking) Relax, Amy. I'm just kiddin'. I swear, if I could figure out how to turn you back... (realizes something) Any way ... <I>Revele</I>!"
WILLOW,"'<I>Cio che fu non e piu. Cio che fu fatto disfa. Passato e il pericolo, finita e la prova. Metti le cosa a posto.</I>'"
WARREN,"Dude, what are you doing?"
JONATHAN,We're not breaking into Langley here. It's Sunnydale.
ANDREW,"Well, you never know what new stuff they have, better safe than-"
WARREN,"Okay, the security system here is a guy named Rusty."
WARREN,Now get up.
ANDREW,"Whoa, head rush. Cool."
WARREN,"Guys, come on, quit jerking around."
ANDREW,"See, that's cool. How come he gets to play with all the cool stuff?"
JONATHAN,Because I'm allergic to methane and you're still afraid of hot things?
ANDREW,(pouty) I know.
JONATHAN,"Besides, the tank kept making both of us tip over, remember?"
WARREN,Got it!
JONATHAN,It's beautiful.
WARREN,"Boys, congratulations, Phase One of the plan is now complete. Let's get the hell outta here."
RUSTY,What are you boys doing?
WARREN,"Um, we're with a tour group. (pauses) The Get-The-Freeze-Ray tour group. Musta gotten separated."
RUSTY,Museum closed five hours ago.
WARREN,Really?
RUSTY,Uh-huh.
WARREN,"Huh! Guess we just lost track of time, we should probably get the *freeze ray* out of here now."
WARREN,"'Cause we love the learning, Rusty. (walking closer to Rusty) Museums, libraries, Disney Hall of Presidents ... not boring. But more to the point? Good-bye."
WARREN,"(excited) Dude, that is so cool! (walks closer to Rusty)"
ANDREW,The freeze ray totally worked.
JONATHAN,"Yeah, uh, not exactly."
WARREN,"(still gazing at Rusty) So there's a kink or two. It's just a prototype. I mean, soon we'll have-"
JONATHAN,"Hey, that's really neato and stuff, but in the meantime, you know ... ow!"
WARREN,(glances at him) Be a bigger wuss.
JONATHAN,Can we just go back to the lair? Because ... I can't ... really feel my fingers.
WARREN,"Yeah, yeah, come on."
ANDREW,Is he gonna like-
WARREN,"Oh, he'll be fine. Yeah, he'll defrost in a couple of days, no harm, no foul."
ANDREW,Won't he tell on us?
WARREN,And say what? 'Two guys and a mime took me out with their freeze ray'? That's likely.
WARREN,Come on!
WILLOW,"Hey. Here's some hot chocolate, you want-"
AMY,"No, thanks. (gestures at her throat) Still ... kinda queasy."
WILLOW,Okay. Maybe later.
WILLOW,"Hey, no, i-it's okay."
WILLOW,"(walking forward) It's, it's just a siren. It's o-it's all right. Okay? You okay?"
AMY,"(twitchy) Mm-hm. Yeah. Just ... you know. (whispers) Everything feels weird. (Willow nods) I mean, it's like ... I felt like I was in that cage for weeks. (Willow looks nervous) But it can still be okay ... right? I-I can still get into the swing of things, like ... prom's coming up. I-I'm so hoping Larry would ask me. We would make such a splash at- (sees Willow's expression) Oh. Oh god. (sighs, anxiously) He hasn't asked someone else, has he?"
WILLOW,"Uh, Amy ... three things we have to talk about. One, Larry's gay. (Amy staring at her) Two, Larry's dead. (Amy still staring) And three, high school's ... kinda over."
AMY,How long was I in the cage?
AMY,How long?!
BUFFY,Willow?
BUFFY,Hey. (they smile at each other) How you doin'?
WILLOW,Oh. Uh ... okay. (sits up)
BUFFY,Yeah? (sits on bed beside Willow)
WILLOW,"Yeah. Not parades and cotton candy, but ... okay."
BUFFY,"Will, um ... can I talk to you about something?"
WILLOW,Of course.
BUFFY,"(nervous) Right. Okay. Um ... You know how we all make choices? And sometimes they're good, and ... sometimes they're ... less good."
WILLOW,Uh-huh...
BUFFY,"Well, lately, I, uh..."
BUFFY,"Oh, Tara, hey- (pauses, stares) Amy?!"
AMY,(to Willow) The whole school?
AMY,"By a giant snake thing. (nods) Okay, still adjusting. Hi Buffy."
BUFFY,Hi. (awkwardly) How've you been?
AMY,Rat. You?
BUFFY,Dead.
AMY,Oh.
BUFFY,"(looking at Willow) Well, I should ... let you guys catch up, I can-"
AMY,"No no no, stay. (twitchy) Do you have any cookies?"
BUFFY,"Uh, yeah, w-what kind?"
AMY,Any kind. Not cheese.
BUFFY,"Um, sure, in the, the kitchen, I'll just get 'em- (gets up)"
AMY,"Oh no, I'll grab 'em. (moves toward the door)"
BUFFY,"Okay, well, at least, you know, let me make up the, the couch for you? It's late, you should stay here. Everybody does."
AMY,(distracted) Thank you.
BUFFY,Wow.
WILLOW,(smiling) I know.
BUFFY,Is ... she gonna be okay?
WILLOW,"Don't know. She's kinda freaked out. I mean, I would be too."
BUFFY,Wow.
WILLOW,"I, I just realized I could. Thought of the right thing, and ... it's nice, having another magically-inclined friend around."
WILLOW,"So, w-what were you gonna tell me? You were sounding all serious."
BUFFY,"Huh? Oh. Uh, it's nothing. I mean, the whole Amy, rat, Amy thing ... no way I'm toppin' that."
BUFFY,Hey. (Amy mutes the TV) How you doin'? Need anything?
AMY,"No, thanks. Good cookies."
AMY,Sorry about your mom.
BUFFY,(softly) Thanks.
AMY,"It's crazy, all the things that've happened since I went away."
BUFFY,No kidding.
AMY,Snyder got eaten by a snake ... high school got destroyed...
BUFFY,"Oh, Gatorade has a new flavor. Blue."
AMY,See? Head spinning. (shakes head) People getting frozen ... Willow's dating girls ... and did you hear about Tom and Nicole?!
BUFFY,(frowns) People getting frozen?
TV REPORTER,...in critical yet stable condition as local authorities continue their investigation into the robbery that left one man frozen solid.
REPORTER,"Live from the museum, Ryan Morris, KOUS."
AMY,Weird.
BUFFY,"Excuse me, excuse me, thanks."
BUFFY,(annoyed) Great.
SPIKE,"Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up."
BUFFY,"What are you doing here, Spike?"
SPIKE,"Well, you know, a man was frozen alive in there. A little compassion, luv."
SPIKE,"Uh, you know, as long as we're both here, you might as well tag along. I mean, as a team we could-"
BUFFY,"Yeah, that never really ends well, does it?"
SPIKE,It did the other night.
BUFFY,"You really seem awfully fixated on a couple of kisses, Spike."
SPIKE,And you seem awfully quick to forget about them.
BUFFY,"Look. I'm sorry, okay? I'm-I'm sorry if you thought that it meant more."
SPIKE,But...
BUFFY,"But ... when I kissed you ... you know I was thinking about Giles, right?"
SPIKE,"You know, I always wondered about you two."
BUFFY,"What? (makes a face) Oh, gross, Spike! (Spike frowns) He left. I was depressed. Ergo vulnerability and, and bad kissing decisions. (Spike still frowning) Okay, but, that's all that it was. You have to let it go."
SPIKE,(smirking) Did it work?
BUFFY,What?
SPIKE,You convince yourself?
BUFFY,"(seriously) Please, stop."
SPIKE,A man can change.
BUFFY,You're not a man. You're a thing.
SPIKE,Stop walking away.
BUFFY,Don't touch me!
SPIKE,"Ahh, ahh, ohh! (grabs his head)"
BUFFY,"You're a thing. An evil, disgusting, thing."
SPIKE,(to himself) Look at all the goodies.
SPIKE,"That's right, you should scream."
SPIKE,"Creature of the night here, yeah? (indicating himself) Some people forget that."
WOMAN,Please.
SPIKE,She thinks I'm housebroken. She forgot who she's dealing with.
WOMAN,"Anything you want, please-"
SPIKE,"Just 'cause she's confused about where she fits in, I'm supposed to be too? 'Cause I'm not. (pacing back and forth) I know what I am. I'm dangerous. I'm evil."
WOMAN,(scared) I-I'm sure you're not evil.
SPIKE,"Yes, I am. I am a killer. (moves closer to her) That's what I do. I kill. And, yeah, maybe it's been a long time, but ... it's not like you forget how."
SPIKE,"You just ... do it. (nervously) And now I can, again, all right? So here goes."
SPIKE,This might hurt a little.
SPIKE,What the hell is going on?
TARA,"Good god, that's a lot of shake. (Dawn nods) I mean, I know, part of our ... big ... movie and milkshake fun day, but ... good god, that's a lot of shake."
DAWN,(laughs) Helps to wash down the Raisinettes.
TARA,"Promise me that you will eat something green tonight. Leafy green, not ... gummi green."
TARA,The movie was fun.
DAWN,Yeah. It was ironic when all those cute inner-city kids taught their coach a valuable lesson.
TARA,"You know that I will always be there for you, right? (Dawn looks at her, stops smiling) There, there was actually more of a lead-in when I practiced that at home."
DAWN,I know.
TARA,"It's just ... I wanted you to know that ... my moving out had nothing to do with you, and I, I will never stop loving you."
DAWN,I know. (beat) Do you think you'll ever get back together?
TARA,I wish I knew.
DAWN,But you still love her.
TARA,Very much. I just ... sometimes ... other things get in the way.
DAWN,"I know. (nervously) Uh, she's been doing a lot better lately, though. Uh, she's been really good about ... being careful ... a-about stuff."
TARA,"Well, good. Great, that's ... that's great."
WILLOW,Here. Says the guard's definitely gonna live.
XANDER,"(reading newspaper) He's all thawed out, says they used hair-dryers. Huh."
Shot of the newspaper with an article headline reading,"<code>Museum Guard Attacked, Frozen. Body Thawed, Remains Unconscious.</code>"
WILLOW,"Everything slowed down. His nervous system, circulatory system. He's still unconscious."
BUFFY,Anya?
ANYA,"It's such a pain. The text I wanted, Giles took it with him. He has this thing that ... owning a book makes it like his property."
BUFFY,"What should we do, should we call him? It's like the middle of last night there. (frowns) Or maybe it's tomorrow. Anyone remember how that works?"
WILLOW,"That's okay, no one freak. We'll just do it another way. (reaches for her bag)"
BUFFY,I-I don't think we need to resort to ... I mean...
BUFFY,"Oh. Hey, cool."
XANDER,"All right, back to basics. A little old-fashioned state-of-the-art hacker action."
BUFFY,"That's great, Will, I haven't seen you do that in a long time."
BUFFY,(to Xander) I-I don't remember that part. (Buffy and Xander staring at Willow)
WILLOW,(staring blankly in front of her) It's quicker. It'll just take me a sec to go through the files. Okay. Internal police report.
WILLOW,"A diamond was stolen from the museum last night. A big one. On loan from the British museum. They're withholding information to smoke out the criminals. Oh! It's pretty. (looks at Buffy, smiles) There's a picture."
BUFFY,"Well, is it a, a supernatural diamond? You know, like, healing powers, or, or good-lucky?"
ANYA,Maybe it's cursed. Diamonds are excellent for cursing.
WILLOW,"(again staring blankly) Well, we'll keep checking, shall we?"
XANDER,"(awkwardly) Well, you know, I am kinda beat, and I bet you that's tiring, that ... thing you're doing there... (fake yawn)"
WILLOW,"Guys, I'm fine. What's the deal with-"
ANYA,"Oh, for crying out loud. This is bizarre. You're all, 'la la la!' with, with the magic, and the not talking, like everything's normal, when we all know that Tara up and left you and now everyone's scared to say anything to you. (pauses, smiles) Except me. (looks at Xander) Is this that thing I do that you were commenting- (Xander nods)"
WILLOW,"Guys ... it's okay. It's hard ... but i-it's better this way. Little things just ... starting taking over, things that didn't matter, but we saw them differently, so ... they got blown out of proportion. (Shot of Buffy and Xander listening) And, this time away will help us sort through things. Really. Now, let's just keep working on this. I don't wanna leave Amy alone in the house so long."
XANDER,"Amy, is she ... how is she adjusting?"
WILLOW,"It's hard to say. It's a lot to take in. I keep expecting her to do, like, ratty stuff, you know, licking her hands clean, shredding newspaper, leaving little pellets in the corner."
BUFFY,Let's definitely not leave her alone in the house too long.
Cut to,close shot of the diamond sitting on a piece of black velvet.
JONATHAN,I didn't know it'd be so sparkly.
ANDREW,It's so big.
WARREN,"Yes, gentlemen, it turns out, size is everything. (puts hand on Jonathan's leg) No offense, man."
ANDREW,It makes colors with the light.
WARREN,"All right, I think we've finished the first part, now it's time for Phase Two."
WARREN,Is the van fired up?
JONATHAN,Check.
ANDREW,"Hello, it's called knocking."
SPIKE,"Knock knock, robot boy. (knocks on Warren's head) Need you to look at my chip."
JONATHAN,"Is that like, British slang or something? 'Cause we're not-"
SPIKE,"In my head, the chip in my head."
WARREN,We're kind of in the middle of something.
SPIKE,"Well, you can play holodeck another time. Right now, I'm in charge."
WARREN,"Yeah, what are you gonna do if we don't especially feel like maybe playing your-"
WARREN,"What are, wait, what are you doing?"
SPIKE,"Examine my chip, or else Mister... (looks at the label on the stand) ...Fett here is the first to die."
JONATHAN,"Hey, all right, let's not, let's not do anything crazy here."
ANDREW,"That's a limited edition, 1979 mint condition Boba Fett."
WARREN,"All right, dude ... chill. You can still make it right. You know you don't wanna do this."
SPIKE,"What I want ... is answers, nimrod."
WARREN,"Right. But you don't wanna hurt the Fett, 'cause man, you're *not* comin' back from that. You know, you don't just do that and walk away."
SPIKE,That right? Let's find out.
WARREN,"Wah, uh, one second."
ANDREW,"Dudes, I think that's Spike."
JONATHAN,"Of course it is, and he's evil. Completely capable of removing that head."
WARREN,I'm gonna help him out.
JONATHAN,"Are you sure we can trust him? I mean, we all have heads too."
WARREN,"See, we help him, and he owes us one. See, we get Spike on our side, we get info on Buffy. And maybe, maybe we can even find a way to keep her out of Phase Two."
ANDREW,"Jonathan's right, can we trust him?"
WARREN,"'Course not. But alliances aren't about trust. See, he needs us, we need him. (nods) Well, that's how these things work."
WARREN,I think we're ready. Agreed?
JONATHAN,Agreed.
ANDREW,(to Warren) Do what you need to do.
WARREN,"I think we can work something out. I'll take a look at your chip. It'll be a deal. We scratch your back, you scratch-"
SPIKE,"I'm not scratching your anything. You do what I tell you, that's the deal. Deal?"
WARREN,(sighs) Deal.
SPIKE,Then let's go.
ANDREW,"Oh! It's okay, it's okay. It'll be fine."
WILLOW,Amy?
AMY,"Oh god, you're back. (hurries over) I thought you said you wouldn't be gone that long."
WILLOW,"I wasn't. I mean, I thought it was-"
AMY,Let's go somewhere.
WILLOW,Don't you wanna go see your dad?
AMY,(twitchy) No. Can't. Not yet. Too many questions.
WILLOW,(nods) About where you were.
AMY,"No, about how I got there. (pauses) I wish there was a way that I could make him forget about the last three years."
WILLOW,"Oh, well hey, I can help you with that. Only, you might wanna sew your name into your clothes first or something. (puts her bag down)"
AMY,"No ... (crosses arms over her chest) I just don't wanna deal with him right now. I think I would be... (pauses, looks at Willow) ...bored."
WILLOW,(nods) Well.
AMY,"Come on, let's get outta here."
WILLOW,"(uncertain) Oh, well, what do you wanna do?"
AMY,"I don't know. Something fun. Anything ... not involving a big wheel. (Willow smiles a little) Or ... maybe ... you'd rather sit home all night, alone, like in high school."
WILLOW,"No! (stands up) No, you know what? I can have fun. Heck, I, I deserve some fun."
AMY,Yeah you do!
WILLOW,"I can party! Not like I owe anyone anything. I am totally free. (nods) So, let's make with the fun."
ANDREW,"You're English, right?"
SPIKE,(frowns at him suspiciously) Yeah.
ANDREW,"I've seen every episode of <I>Doctor Who</I>. (Spike continues frowning) Not <I>Red Dwarf</I>, though, 'cause, um..."
JONATHAN,'Cause it's not out yet on DVD.
ANDREW,Right. It's not out on ... (weakly) DVD.
SPIKE,(yells) Warren!!
WARREN,"Here I am, here."
SPIKE,Bloody hell. Get on with it then.
SPIKE,"Help me out here, Spock, I don't speak loser. (gives papers back)"
WARREN,"Okay, right, um ... your chip works fine, yeah."
SPIKE,(frowns) There's gotta be something wrong-
WARREN,"No, no, listen. I don't know what that thing does ... I'd like to... (leans closer)"
SPIKE,(leans back) Hey.
WARREN,"But whatever it is, it works fine. There's no deterioration of the signal, it still is coming through on a steady pulse. Which it's supposed to."
SPIKE,If you're lying to me-
WARREN,"No! It's all right here. I, I mean, it is. It's really not that hard to figure out, if you just... (sees Spike frowning) What?"
SPIKE,You tell anyone about this...
WARREN,"No, I promise. Who would I tell, I don't even know what this is about!"
SPIKE,It's about the rules having changed.
SPIKE,Everything's different now.
SPIKE,(to himself) Nothing wrong with me. Something wrong with her.
DAWN,(calls) Hello! We're home!
TARA,Looks like no one's here.
DAWN,"Well, I'm sure they'll be back soon. Um, I know Willow and Buffy were meeting up with Xander to do some research."
TARA,"Well then I, I should really get back."
DAWN,"Or, you can stay and wait for them. (sits on couch) Then you can get a chance to catch up with ... everyone."
TARA,"Yeah, I-I don't think that's such a great idea."
DAWN,Okay. Your call. (picks up TV remote) I have the TV to keep me company until they get back.
DAWN,(innocently) You notice how it's been getting dark so much earlier these days?
DAWN,"(giggles, indicates TV) Talking cat."
TARA,"Fine. I'll stay, but just until they get back. And only to make sure that you're not alone, this ... has nothing to do with ... anyone else."
DAWN,Sure. Cool. Up to you.
MALE SINGER,
WILLOW,"I know. Xander engaged, I couldn't believe it either. (straightens up)"
AMY,"It's just so weird. (bends over, sound of billiard balls) So what's she like?"
WILLOW,(shrugs) Thousand-year-old capitalist ex-demon with rabbit phobia. (walks around Amy)
AMY,"Well, that's so his type."
GUY 1,Hey.
WILLOW,(uninterested) Hey.
AMY,(smiling) Hey.
AMY,"Well, let's go then. (to Willow) We're gonna go dance. Do you wanna come?"
WILLOW,"Oh, uh, no, you go. I'll keep an eye on our drinks."
AMY,"Okay. I mean, because, if you want something a little more your style..."
AMY,I'm sure we can swing that.
WILLOW,"No, really, no."
BREE,"(to Willow, seductively) Hi. Bree."
WILLOW,Willow. Nice ... um ... top.
WILLOW,"(nervous) No. Thanks, but no."
AMY,You sure?
WILLOW,"(nods, looks at Bree, then back at Amy) I'm not, she, I'm still-"
AMY,It's cool.
BREE,"Oh, uh, sorry."
GUY 1,"So, uh, are we gonna go?"
AMY,(to Willow) You sure you're gonna be okay?
WILLOW,"Yeah, go. I'm all kinds of good."
MALE SINGER,
WILLOW,"No use looking at me like that. It's the gullet for you, mister."
AMY,"Hey! Sorry, I kinda got caught up. (drinks from another martini)"
WILLOW,"No, it's okay."
AMY,You know ... if rats could dance ... they probably wouldn't gnaw so much.
GUY 1,"Hey, come on. We're just getting started."
AMY,(looks at Willow) I think I'm gonna sit this one out.
GUY 2,"Nuh-uh! You can't, you can't just work us up like that and then just-"
AMY,Hey!
WILLOW,I think she said no.
GUY 2,"Well, nobody asked you ... Ellen."
AMY,You wanna dance?
GUY 1,"That's all. Nice, slow ... relaxing dance."
WILLOW,Gee.
AMY,I think I do feel more relaxed.
XANDER,"Aha! I got it! Uh, here's our villain right here!"
XANDER,What?
ANYA,"That's a D&D manual, sweetie."
XANDER,"No, but it could- (looks at the book cover, laughs weakly) Oh."
ANYA,"Let's face it, we're not gonna find this thing because it doesn't exist. There's no such thing as a frost monster who eats diamonds."
BUFFY,"Well, maybe he doesn't eat them. You know, maybe he just ... thinks they're pretty."
BUFFY,We suck.
XANDER,We need new brains. What's up with Willow?
BUFFY,"Out with Amy, I guess."
ANYA,"Great, someone to do more magic with."
BUFFY,"But at least she's not all cooped up and crying. That's forward momentum. Now, I know that I don't ... know everything that happened with her and Tara, but it-"
XANDER,Tara thinks Willow is doing too much magic. And she's not the only one.
BUFFY,"I know. But I-I think she'll be fine. You know, it's, it's Willow. She of the level head."
ANYA,"Well, those are the ones you have to watch out for the most. Responsible types."
BUFFY,"Right, she might go crazy and start alphabetizing everything."
ANYA,"I'm serious. Responsible people are ... always so concerned with ... being good all the time, that when they finally get a taste of being bad ... they can't get enough. It's like all (gestures) kablooey."
BUFFY,That's not true.
ANYA,"Okay, not kablooey, more like bam."
XANDER,"It's human nature, Buff. Will's getting a taste of something powerful, way bigger than her."
ANYA,"Yeah, she was getting out of control with it before Tara left, and now that she's gone..."
XANDER,It's gotta be seductive.
XANDER,(OS) Just giving in to it. Going totally wild.
XANDER,We need to keep an eye on her.
BUFFY,"Okay. Okay, we'll, we'll keep an eye. But we can't assume that everybody's getting seduced, you know, sometimes-"
BUFFY,"Hello, Magic Box."
SPIKE,(deep gruff voice) Slayer.
BUFFY,(frowns) Spike?
SPIKE,(deep voice) Meet me at the cemetery. Twenty minutes. Come alone.
BUFFY,(still frowning) Spike?
SPIKE,"(rolls eyes, mutters) Bloody hell. (normal voice) Yes, it's me."
BUFFY,You're ... calling me on the phone?
SPIKE,Just be there.
BUFFY,Why? Are you ... helping again? (shot of Xander and Anya listening. Buffy speaks louder) You have a lead on this frost monster thingie?
SPIKE,"(smirking) Something like that, yeah. Thought you might be up for a little grunt work."
BUFFY,"(shocked) What?! No, (whispers) no-no grunting!"
SPIKE,"(grins) I was talking shop, luv, but if you got other ideas ... you, me, cozy little tomb with a view..."
XANDER,"So, what did Captain Peroxide want?"
BUFFY,"Nothing! (nervous) You know, he just, you know, wanted to see if I-I wanted to patrol, for, for the, the monster. (sits) But I, I told him that I ... would ... not."
BUFFY,"I'm telling you, I, I think there's something about this thing."
XANDER,"Well, I don't know, Buff. It seems like we've been through every book."
ANYA,"Yeah, even the ones that weren't so boring you wanted to kill yourself."
XANDER,We have those? (they stop walking)
BUFFY,"I'm just saying, all the things that have happened lately? Okay, the, the bank robbery, the jewelry heist..."
XANDER,The exploding lint.
BUFFY,"I-is it me, or do these things seem really-"
ANYA,Lame?
BUFFY,"(shrugs) Well, I was gonna go with unusual, but, yeah."
BUFFY,"I don't know. You know, I'll do a quick patrol tonight, and after a good night's sleep, we can solve this tomorrow."
ANYA,Optimism. I remember optimism.
XANDER,That's because you're like a thousand.
BUFFY,"Good night, guys."
ANYA/XANDER,Good night.
SPIKE,(angrily) Slayer.
BUFFY,And so my night is now complete.
SPIKE,You never showed.
BUFFY,(walks past him) Sorry. Little busy actually doing stuff.
SPIKE,"(walks beside her) You shouldn't be so flip, luv."
BUFFY,"What are you gonna do, walk behind me to death?"
SPIKE,I'm just saying things might be a little different.
SPIKE,You oughta be careful.
BUFFY,(shakes head) Enough.
BUFFY,(small puzzled smile) Get out of my way.
SPIKE,Or what?
SPIKE,"(mockingly) Oh, the pain! The pain! (grimly) Is gone."
SPIKE,"Guess what I just found out. Looks like I'm not as toothless as you thought, sweetheart."
BUFFY,(alarmed) How?
SPIKE,Don't you get it? Don't you see? (sneering) You came back wrong.
BUFFY,"It's a trick. You did something to the chip, it's a trick."
SPIKE,"It's no trick. It's not me, it's you. Just you, in fact, that's the funny part. (punches her in the face) 'Cause you're the one that's changed. (punches again) That's why this doesn't hurt me."
SPIKE,(grins) Came back a little less human than you were.
BUFFY,(shakes head) You're wrong.
SPIKE,"Then how come you're so spooked, luv? And why can I - (punches her) do that?"
BUFFY,You're wrong.

FEMALE SINGER,<I>Every time I see you I can't find the words to say</I>
FEMALE SINGER,<I>I just wanna turn and run away</I>
SPIKE,"(grinning) Oh, poor little lost girl."
SPIKE,(drops to the floor) She doesn't fit in anywhere. She's got no one to love.
BUFFY,"Me? I'm lost? Look at you, you idiot! (Spike getting up) Poor Spikey. Can't be a human, can't be a vampire. Where the hell do you fit in?"
BUFFY,Your job is to kill the slayer. But all you can do is follow me around making moon eyes.
SPIKE,I'm in love with you.
BUFFY,"(still advancing) You're in love with pain. Admit it. (Spike gets up) You like me ... because you enjoy getting beat down. So really, who's screwed up?"
SPIKE,Hello! Vampire!
SPIKE,I'm supposed to be treading on the dark side.
SPIKE,What's your excuse?
FEMALE SINGER,<I>I can't find the time and place to say what I need to say... </I>

AMY,Yeah.
WILLOW,(gestures) Return.
MALE SINGER,<I>What is wrong with you?</I>
WILLOW,"I, I just keep thinking ... there's gotta be someplace, like, bigger than this."
AMY,"Besides, it's way too early to go home yet."
SPIKE,I wasn't planning on hurting you. (smirks) Much.
BUFFY,You haven't even come close to hurting me.
SPIKE,Afraid to give me the chance?
SPIKE,You afraid I'm gonna-
"Buffy lifts herself up and thrusts her body against Spike's. Spike looks shocked. They stare at each other for a moment. Then Buffy begins to move up and down, slowly, making an expression of pleasure. [note","if you don't know what's going on here, you're probably too young to be reading this!]"
