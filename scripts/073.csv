Buffy,"""Xander, Anya!"""
Willow,"""Buffy another one!"""
Willow,"""Buffy!"""
Buffy,"""Where's the other one?"""
Willow,"""I don't care if it is an orgy of death, there's still  such a thing as a napkin."""
Buffy,"""A nest. No biggie. I bet I could do it.  I know could  take at least two."""
Anya,"""Yes and we could run for help while the other three suck your heart out through your neck."""
Buffy,"""You're right.  It's too many for just us.  You know who  we need."""
Buffy,"""Uh, hi.  We have a problem."""
Jonathan,"""Sounds like you could use my help."""
Buffy,"""Huff."""
Xander,"""No, I tear it and it gets all sloshy.""  [He quickdraws  again.] ""Sshh! Sssh!"""
Buffy,"""Thanks for doing this Jonathan, I-I wouldn't ask but..."""
Jonathan,"""Hey don't worry about it.  Nest full of vampires,  you come get me, ok.  Box full of puppies, that's more of a  judgement call."""
Jonathan,"""Hit me."""
Buffy,"""You got me.  It was very... punchy."""
Jonathan,"""Watch out for southpaws Buff.  Don't let 'em  surprise you."""
Giles,"""Haven't found a reference to any, uh, rituals seems  more like a-a family meal if you will."""
Buffy,"""And they say no one eats <with the tv> on anymore."""
Jonathan,"""Thanks Rupert.""  [Puts his hand on Giles' shoulder.]  ""Well it's good to know we're not walking into the unholy  feast of something or other.""  [Removes hand.]"
Willow,"""Oh Jonathan I'm in.""  [Jonathan walks over to Willow.] ""Schematics for the crypt, part of the original plan for the  cemetery sometime there's a ...  Oh no back way in, just the  one entrance."""
Jonathan,"""Or I bet..."" [He reaches to the computer.] ""There!   We can get in that way."""
Willow,"""Oh of course why didn't I think of that."""
Jonathan,"""I'm sure you would have."""
Jonathan,"""I think we have a plan"" [hands Xander a crossbow and flips Anya a stake] ""Buffy,"" [flips her a stake] ""you go in  first, let em get a look at the slayer. Xander,"" [looks at  chessboard] ""The <?Nimsilitz?> defense.  Let's see if I  remember"" [moves piece] ""hmmm mmm,  mate in four.  You almost  got me that time Rupert."""
Jonathan,"""Xander, Willow and Anya you back up Buffy.  I'll be  the surprise guest.  Everyone lets show these fiends that they  came to the wrong town."""
Vampire,"""Arrggh."""
Willow,"""Buffy, he's getting away!"""
Buffy,"""I should have gotten that one."""
Jonathan,"""You got two of them. And that second one was ready  for you.""  [Smiles.] ""You should feel pretty good."""
Jonathan,"""Don't worry. You know it only matters that you do  your best."""
Buffy,"""But that's just it."" [Cut to the outside.] ""I don't  think it was my best."""
Jonathan,"""Ok guys that's enough."""
Xander,"""I think did great.  We knocked em dead. Which they  already were."""
Willow,"""We knocked 'em deader!"""
Anya,"""They weren't very well organized.  If they had all  rushed at Buffy they could have killed her right away."""
Buffy,"""Thanks Anya. That won't keep me awake all night."""
Jonathan,"""Vampires only form nests to make hunting easier. They're not big on the cooperation.  They mostly like to hang  out all creepy and alone in the shadows.  Don't you agree... "" [turning head] ""Spike?"""
Spike,"""Well, well the man himself."""
Jonathan,"""What are you doing here?"""
Spike,"""I live here. I wasn't exactly pining for a noisy visit from 'wonder Jonathan and his fluffy battle kittens'."""
Buffy,"""Yeah? You think that one up with all the time you spend  not being able to bite people?"""
Jonathan,"""Careful, he's still pretty dangerous."""
Spike,"""Yeah, back off 'Betty.'"""
Buffy,"""It's Buffy, you big bleached...""  [music ends] ""stupid  guy."""
Jonathan,"""Spike you're the worst type of scum.  The second  you're back to your old tricks well, let's just say before you  even sniff out your first victim you'll be pretty  indistinguishable from, oh what should we say... instant soup  mix."""
Willow,"""Next thing I know this crazed vamp is like running  right at me and I know if it gets past me there's no telling  who's in danger next."""
Tara,"""Come on you have fun. Admit it - living the scooby life."""
Willow,"""I was going for a kind of stoic bravery but yeah.  And  it was exciting with the ceiling coming in and everything..."""
Tara,"""Oh, that's a cute one!  A-and Buffy she was ok?"""
Willow,"""Oh she was great!  Twang! Poof!""  [Tara looks  confused.]  That was the sound - the crossbow, vampire dusting. I mean she was a little cranky that she missed that one vamp."""
Tara,"""W-Well, I-I kind of meant personally.""  [Tara sticks  something on the wall.]  ""That whole thing with Faith it pretty  much freaked me out and I was just sensing it from a distance."""
Willow,"""Oh yeah I know she's not over the whole Riley sleeping  with Faith thing.  Oh.. you know I mean - Faith's insides and  Buffy's outsides when her insides were out."""
Tara,"""I hope they'll be ok."""
Willow,"""I sure it'll blow over.  They're probably all with the  smoochies right now."""
Riley,"""Yeah yeah.  I'm a lot stronger.  I'm no Jonathan but  I'm doing ok."""
Buffy,"""Are you?  I mean you're not?"""
Riley,"""What?"""
Buffy,"""Eating the Initiatives' technicolor food of strongness."""
Riley,"""No, un unnh.  They, uh, they swear they've stopping  treating the food but I'm not taking the chance. You know I uh,  I don't know if that means I'll get weaker or dumber.. or  smarter"""
Buffy,"""They're not big with the disclosure, hunh?"""
Riley,"""They still haven't released a full profile on Adam.   And we're having zero luck tracking him.  I just...  If they'd  just put a little trust in me <and/then> I know I could get the  job done."""
Buffy,"""I've felt that way my entire life."""
Buffy,"""<You'd> think I could do that.  Guess it takes  different muscles than demon beheading."""
Riley,"""You just need a few pointers."""
Buffy,"""Now if slaying was a competitive sport, then I'd have a  chance.  You know we could have figure staking and speed  staking.  I..  "" [She becomes more uneasy and turns bumping the  still injured Riley.]  ""AShhh, sorry I, this just isn't my  game, I gotta..."""
Buffy,"""It's all Faith's fault.  She's like poison.  No worse,  she's like acid that eats through everything.  [Buffy switches  to pouring sugar.] Maybe she's a bomb. [Buffy stirs.]  The  point is everything was going along great with Riley and then  she comes along and messes everything up.  [Buffy hands the cup  of coffee to Jonathan.]"
Jonathan,"""Buffy you know what I think:  I don't think this  about you being angry with Faith, I think you're angry with  Riley."""
Girl,"""Hi, could you please?"""
Jonathan,"""Sure."" [Jonathan signs an autograph.] Jonathan: ""I mean you have this amazing connection with him "" [He hands the autograph back to the girl.]"
Girl,Thank you.
Jonathan,"""and then at the one moment when it matters the most he looks into your eyes and he doesn't even see that it's not  you looking back at him."""
Buffy,"""There's no way he could know.  I mean you don't just  look at someone and say 'Hey that's not your body, get out of  that body with your hands up!'""  [She gestures with her hands  up.]"
Jonathan,"""I know you know that.  But you have to believe it! Buffy if there's any part of you that's blaming Riley for what  happened, it seems like there's a part of you that needs to  forgive him."""
Karen,"""You're Jonathan Levinson!  Oh my god!  Oh my god!   My name is Karen and I think you're.. You're wonderful! Oh my god!"""
Jonathan,"""Hi Karen, thank you.  Oh, is that my book?  Well I  could, uh"" [He reaches for a pen.]"
Karen,"""Yeah please I-I didn't want to bother you!  It's Karen  with a K!"""
Karen,"""Thank you!... So much!!! Thanks!"""
Jonathan,"""So what do think Buffy? I mean if I'm wrong smack me. Karen with a k will lend you a book and it's pretty heavy.  Heh."""
Buffy,"""Maybe I have been blaming him.  But how do I get past  it?  Hmmph.  What if it's too late?  what if after all this he  doesn't want me anymore?"""
Jonathan,"""He does.  It's not going to be easy Buffy, but you  guys are very special together.  That's worth a little hard  work."""
Buffy,"""But I'm not even sure if I know how to talk to him  anymore.  How do I make it ok again?"""
Jonathan,"""If you really want it""  [The camera angle on  Jonathan changes so a billboard of Jonathan hawking tennis  shoes is visible. ""Light as a feather"" is the slogan.] ""you can make anything happen."""
Colonel,"""For those of you who don't already know my name is  Colonel George <Halliwell>.  I'm commanding officer here until  such time as the facility review is completed.  This review  does not mean our primary mission is changed in any way. Recovery of the hostile known as Adam is our first and most  important job.  To this end I've asked our tactical consultant  here to address us today.  Mr. Levinson."""
Jonathan,"""Thank you, colonel."""
Jonathan,"""Men, before we can locate Adam we need to understand  him better.  And there's something that's bothered me almost  from the start.  He doesn't eat.   We've known him to kill but  never to eat the kill.  So I've pulled some of Professor  Walsh's original design schematics and I've found something -  his power source is not biological at all.  It's here"" [points  to center of chest in the skeletal schematic.]  ""The design  attempts to hide it, but I believe that there's a small  reservoir of uranium 235."""
Riley,"""Sir, how long will it last?"""
Jonathan,"""Essentially forever.  It also means that cutting off  his head is useless.  Killing Adam means annihilating him  completely.  But first we have to find him."""
Karen,"""Where are you Jonathan?  Are you like, never home?"""
Jonathan,"""She's ready to forget it.  You better be ready too."" [He ties a black cloth around his neck.]"
Riley,"""I don't know Jonathan. I mean I don't know if she'll  really ever forget it. Every time I try to touch her..."""
Jonathan,"""She's scared."""
Riley,"""Scared of me?"""
Jonathan,"""Scared of what you're thinking about."""
Riley,"""What do you mean?"""
Jonathan,"""She knows that Faith is .... experienced.""   [He pushes a clip into the pistol and cocks it.]"
Riley,"""What are you saying... experienced?  God!  Does she  think that - what - that I'd be comparing?  She knows she's the  one I... care about."""
Jonathan,"""Have you let her know that?"""
Riley,"""I think I - Haven't I? - She has to know"""
Jonathan,"""People can't always see what's right in front of them."""
Band,"""Witch doctor.  <?stirred it up for me?>  I took sips  from your sweet lips and now I can't get free.  Trapped in a  web of love.  Trapped in a web of love."""
Anya,"""Did not."""
Xander,"""Last night with me you said Jonathan."""
Anya,"""It was a moan!"""
Xander,"""Fine!  You moaned Jonathan!"""
Anya,"""Not unh! It was like unnh-unnh-atha."""
Xander,"""Maybe it was ahh-onathan. Still not fluffing up  the old ego."""
Riley,"""Quite the couple, aren't they?"""
Buffy,"""They get into a fistfight, I've got a fifty on Anya."""
Riley,"""Wonder if they'll make it?"""
Jonathan,"""Good evening everyone.  I'd to dedicate this to  some friends of mine - a very special couple who've been going  through a tough time."""
Riley,"""Buffy I want you to know."""
Buffy,"""Do we have to have the talk? No talk, more dance."""
Riley,"""I just want to say I'm sorry.  That's it's only you  that I want."""
Buffy,"""I know.  I know all of that."""
Riley,"""You do?""  [Buffy nods.] ""Since when?"""
Buffy,"""Since you put your arms around me."""
Tara,"""Oh my god!.  He's going to do something off the new album."""
Anya,"""Xander."""
Xander,"""Yeah."""
Anya,"""Let's go have sex now."""
Xander,"""Yeah, ok."""
Buffy,"""Oh!  What is it?  Are you ok?"""
Jonathan,"""Karen, that's your name isn't it? I-I signed my book  for you.""  [He holds her arms.] ""Tell me what hurt you Karen.   I can help."""
Policeman,"""Mr. Levinson, someone on your staff reported a  disturbance.""  [A third policeman is visible in the room.]   ""When I realized it was on your property I thought I'd better  come down in person."""
Jonathan,"""That's all right sergeant.  I have it under control."""
Sergeant,"""Of course sir. Glad to see you're alright."""
Jonathan,"""Karen I know you're scared, but I need to hear your  description again."""
Karen,"""It was ugly - big ugly - all bent over sort of with  these... huge arms and like... scabs and stuff."""
Jonathan,"""That must have been very frightening.  I'm so sorry."""
Karen,"""Oh! Oh! I forgot. It had a mark!"""
Jonathan,"""A mark?"""
Karen,"""On it's forehead, like a symbol."""
Jonathan,"""Well.  This is a clue."""
Buffy,"""But it did this time, it might again."" [Eager.] ""Maybe  we should patrol."""
Jonathan,"""Actually I think Karen simply startled it.  Probably  more afraid of you then were of it.  I'll patrol but you don't  need to worry about it.  I can handle it on my own.  Now let's  see about getting Karen a ride home."""
Vampire,"""I wish you'd get rid of that body.  The smell's  making me hungry."""
Adam,"""You wouldn't want it.  It had a blood disease.  It didn't  know it but it would have been dead within the year.  Humans  sense so little of what they carry inside."""
Vampire,"""Oh alright.  Well, you're the evil messiah guy, so  henh.  Oh hey there's something new in town, yeah, attacked a  girl, caused a little fuss.  Oh, he was there.  Pfft!"""
Vampire,"""Jonathan."""
Adam,"""Jonathan.  Tell me who is he?"""
Vampire,"""Henh, you're joking right?  Jonathan is Jonathan.   Look."""
Adam,"""These are lies."" [He turns off the tvs.] ""None of this  is real.  The world has been changed.  It's intriguing but  it's wrong."""
Vampire,"""Feels ok to me."""
Adam,"""You're under his spell just like the others.  I seem to  be the only one who is not."""
Vampire,"""Really?  And what makes you so special?"""
Adam,"""I'm aware. I know every molecule of myself and  everything around me.   No one - no human, no demon - has ever  been as awake and alive as I am. You are all just shadows."""
Vampire,"""Oh.  So what do - what do you do now?""  [enthused] ""Hey you could kill Jonathan!""  [Shakes head.]  ""Well, or you  could try.  The guy's like a dynamo of action."""
Adam,"""I don't need to do anything.  These magicks are  unstable, corrosive.  They will inevitably lead to chaos.  And  I am interested in chaos."""
Jonathan,"""Be right there."""
Willow,"""I'm glad you're ok. Everyone in the Bronze was pretty  freaked out after you left.'"
Tara,"""So I guess you have go fight this thing, hunh?"""
Willow,"""All the weapons are at Giles'.  It shouldn't take too  long."""
Buffy,"""No go."""
Willow,"""Did you just go 'no go'?"""
Buffy,"""Jonathan did.  He said it was some brainless beasty and that he would take care of it himself."""
Willow,"""Oh cool."""
Buffy,"""I guess. I don't know he just... he seemed a little  scared."""
Willow,"""Henh! Buffy this is Jonathan. You know he doesn't get  scared.  You talked about it when you gave him the class  protector award at the prom."""
Buffy,"""You're right."""
Tara,"""Ummm, my exit. Willow, I-I'll see you tomorrow."""
Willow,"""Ok."""
Willow,"""So.  Saw you and Riley, with the dancing."""
Buffy,"""It was a great dance."
Buffy,"""For the first time it felt like Faith wasn't there. Like no one was there but us."""
Tara,"""<Sensus> <confundomtor> <era> <ah> <pleator>  <obscurator>"""
Buffy,"""What's going on?""  [She sees Tara laying on the bed.   Tara has scratches and abrasions.]  ""Oh my god."""
Willow,"""She's gonna be ok, but she's terrified."""
Buffy,"""What happened? What did this?"""
Willow,"""Someone found her in the janitor's closet about an  hour ago.  I-I think she was there all night - she was all  alone."""
Buffy,"""Tara, what did this?"""
Tara,"""Big, lumpy. had something on its - on its head.  Like a  Greek letter only not."""
Buffy,"""This, was it this?"""
Willow,"""Buffy Jonathan said we were all safe.  ***Jonathan  said it.***"""
Anya,"""Xander's not here."""
Buffy,"""Oh."""
Anya,"""You're not going away.  Why aren't you going away?"""
Buffy,"""Oh I was kind of hoping to look at some of Xander's  stuff."""
Anya,"""Oh.""  [Smiles] ""Sure.  Come on in.""  [Waves Buffy in.] ""Make yourself at home. And so on."""
Anya,"""Oh you're still here."" [smiles faintly] ""That's nice."""
Buffy,"""May I ask you something?  Does it every seem just a  little strange that Jonathan is so good at everything?"""
Anya,"""Hey!  I was just at the part where he invented the  internet."""
Buffy,"""Anya he fights better than I do.  And I'm the slayer."" [Points to self] ""The Slayer! That's supposed to mean  something right?"""
Anya,"""Oh! buck up you.""  [She punches Buffy in the arm very  softly.]  ""You kill the best.""  [She makes rah rah gestures.]  ""Go you. Kill, kill."""
Buffy,"""Actually not needing validation right now, but thank  you."""
Buffy,"""He just seems too perfect."" [She looks at the book  which is titled 'Oh Jonathan' an autobiography.] ""I don't know."""
Anya,"""So I can have my book back?"""
Buffy,"""Anya when you were a demon, you granted wishes right?"""
Anya,"""Vengeance wishes on ex boyfriends.  I'd wish he was a  dog or ugly or in love with president McKinley or something."""
Buffy,"""But someone could wish the whole world to be different  right?  That's possible?"""
Anya,"""Sure, alternate realities. You could uh, could have like a world without shrimp. Or with, you know, nothing but shrimp. You could even make like a freaky world where Jonathan's some  kind of not perfect mouth breather if that's what's blowing  up your skirt these days. Just don't ask me to live there! Now if I, uh, could just have book back you could be on  your way someplace else?"""
Buffy,"""I'm just saying it doesn't make any sense.  H-he  starred in the Matrix but he never left town.  And how'd he  graduate from med school?  He's only eighteen years old."""
Xander,"""Effective time management?"""
Giles,"""I-I'm sorry Buffy, <but> I just don't understand what  you're trying to say."""
Anya,"""Yeah and when is Jonathan going to get here and start the  meeting?"""
Buffy,"""This is the meeting."""
Willow,"""This is the meeting?"""
Buffy,"""Well, I was just kind of wondering if maybe anyone  thought that Jonathan was kind of too perfect?"""
Xander,"""No he's not!  He's just perfect enough!  He crushed  the bones of the master, he blew up a big snake made out of  mayor and he coached the U.S. women's soccer team to stunning  World Cup victory!  We saw him doing those things!"""
Buffy,"""But that's just it.  I'm not entirely sure that we can trust our memories. Anya tell them about the alternate  universes."""
Anya,"""Oh ok. Umm. Say you really like shrimp a lot.  Or we  could say you don't like shrimp at all."""
Anya,"""Blah I wish there weren't any shrimp you would say to  yourself."""
Buffy,"""Stop you're saying it wrong!  I think that Jonathan may  be doing something so that he's manipulating the world and  we're all like his pawns."""
Anya,"""Or prawns."""
Buffy,"""Stop with the shrimp I am trying to do something here!"""
Buffy,"""I'm not."""
Riley,"""Sounds like nonsense."" [Buffy looks discouraged.]  ""But  I'm starting to know this girl pretty well [he stands, walks  and stops beside Buffy] and I think she sees things that the  rest of us don't.  I think, for once, we should follow her  lead."""
Buffy,"""Ok.  I think Jonathan might be ignoring evidence. I think he might have let Tara get hurt."""
Willow,"""On purpose?"""
Buffy,"""No!  No."""
Giles,"""How did he ignore evidence?"""
Buffy,"""The monster had a mark on it.  Jonathan saw it a-and  he kind of... blinked."""
Xander,"""He blinked?  The man moistened his eyeballs and we're  having a meeting about it."""
Buffy,"""Wuh.  He knows something about the monster.  He was  reacting to the mark.  Oh!!! [jumps up]  Wait, I remember  something.  Giles, do you have a Jonathan swimsuit calendar?"""
Giles,"""No."""
Giles,"""Yes.  It was a gift."""
Anya,"""Yeah.  Pretty darn lickable."""
Willow,"""The other kind of oh.  That's it that's what Tara saw."""
Riley,"""Why would Jonathan have the same mark as the monster?"""
Buffy,"""I don't know.  But he's definitely keeping.."""
Buffy,"""Jonathan!"""
Jonathan,"""Buffy?"""
Buffy,"""No!""  [Closes door] ""It's just ... the mark.  You said  it was safe.. and it wasn't.  I'm sorry.. I just don't  understand."""
Jonathan,"""Then I'll explain.""        [All sit or take positions to listen.]"
Jonathan,"""Buffy is right."""
Jonathan,"""I do have a history with the creature.  The monster. The problem is every time I face it my mind becomes sort of  confused.  There's some kind of power it possesses."""
Xander,"""Oh!!! oh!  He's like your kryptonite."""
Jonathan,"""Maybe.  I just knows it takes all my energy to try  and fight the confusion.  That's why I had his mark tattooed on  me so that I wouldn't underestimate it next time."""
Xander,"""I knew you wouldn't do anything on purpose."
Buffy,"""Jonathan let's go after the monster. Right now, you  and me."""
Jonathan,"""I'm sure it's left town by now.  That's been its  pattern."""
Jonathan,"""Goodbye."""
Spike,"""Oh look Jonathan.  Taking the little sidekick out for a  walk, are we?"""
Buffy,"""Shut up Spike."""
Jonathan,"""That's enough of the creepy small talk!  We're  looking for a monster."""
Spike,"""Why would I know about that?"""
Jonathan,"""Every demon in this town's gunning for you right now so I figure you're probably keeping pretty good track of them. Big arms, mark on its head... have you seen it?"""
Spike,"""No.  But then again I'm probably lying."""
Jonathan,"""We're not getting anything out of him."""
Buffy,"""You're pretty much relying on butcher's blood these  days right, Spike?"""
Spike,"""What are you saying?"""
Buffy,"""Just that the butchers in this town respect Jonathan.  They do him a favor and you might find yourself getting kind  of thirsty."""
Spike,"""[sighs] Look I don't know much, ok.  Some vampires got  kicked out of a cave in the hills behind <Brutside> park."""
Spike,"""I don't know what did the kicking out but it's probably  pretty big."""
Jonathan,"""That was very good.""  [Buffy smiles.  He rebuttons his jacket.] ""Very good."""
Riley,"""These spells... these really work?  I mean, can you  really 'turn your enemies inside out'?  Or... learn to 'excrete  gold coins'?"""
Anya,"""That one's not so much fun."""
Willow,"""They work Riley but they take concentration.  Being  attuned with the forces of the universe."""
Xander,"""Right you can't just go 'librum incendere' and expect.."""
Giles,"""Xander don't speak Latin in front of the books."""
Willow,"""Hey I-I found the mark.  It's part of an augmentation  spell."" [Distressed.] ""Jonathan did an augmentation spell."""
Riley,"""What, uh, did he have, uh, you know?"""
Willow,"""Him!  And how we see him.  This spell turns the  sorcerer into a sort of paragon, the best of everything,  everyone's ideal.  But-but there's a drawback."""
Riley,"""A drawback?"""
Xander,"""That happens a lot."""
Anya,"""He created the monster."""
Xander,"""So we're saying he did a spell just to make us think  he was cool?"""
Giles,"""Yes."""
Xander,"""That is so cool!"""
Riley,"""Giles, Buffy and Jonathan are going after this  nightmare thing.  Are they going to be ok?"""
Giles,"""It seems that the well being of this creature is linked  to Jonathan.  If it dies the spell is broken and Jonathan  reverts to... whatever he was before."""
Anya,"""Jonathan isn't gonna want Buffy to get very far."""
Buffy,"""Wow!  Fall down there and be dead for a while."""
Jonathan,"""Yeah,"" [thinking and looking at Buffy] ""don't want  that to happen."""
Anya,"""It doesn't sound very likely, does it?"""
Riley,"""So if this is the world he created, what's the real  world like?"""
Willow,"""I'm scared.  Everything's going to change."""
Giles,"""Well, actually it'll remain pretty much the same except Jonathan won't be Jonathan - not our Jonathan, anyway."""
Xander,"""No! No! No!  World without sunshine!  World without  joy!"""
Riley,"""But wait, it only changes back if Buffy kills this  thing!  I mean if she loses then we could be stuck in this  wrong world forever!"""
Xander,"""Things looking up!  I mean - we're all happy here  right?  You know if she doesn't get killed?"""
Willow,"""Giles, can Buffy do it?"""
Giles,"""I-I honestly don't know she's never stood alone against  something like this before."""
Buffy,"""Jonathan what do I do?"""
Jonathan,"""I think you're going to have to handle this one  solo."""
Buffy,"""What?  But I.."""
Jonathan,"""You'll know, you used to.  And the more you hurt it  the more I'll lose my.."""
Buffy,"""What?  Lose your..."""
Willow,"""I can't believe we believed it"""
Riley,"""It seemed so real."""
Buffy,"""Well, in that world, it was real."""
Anya,"""Alternate realities are neat."""
Xander,"""You know what I'll always remember?"""
Riley,"""The swimsuit calendar's sticking in my mind.""  [Buffy  looks at him and raises her eyebrows.]  ""Not in a good way."""
Xander,"""I'll always remember the way he made me feel about me. Valued, respected, sort of tingly...  Now I'm just empty."""
Buffy,"""Poor Xander.  I guess Jonathan hurt you most of all."""
Buffy,"""Except of course, after Tara."""
Riley,"""Did anyone else feel way too tall?  I felt way too  tall."""
Xander,"""I liked his clothes. He had really cool clothes."""
Willow,"""Still not understanding how he got the house and  everything."""
Anya,"""And who really did star in the Matrix?"""
Jonathan,"""Hi. I wasn't sure you'd come over.  Everyone's  mostly forgetting. But, I think some people are kind of angry."""
Buffy,"""Yeah!"""
Jonathan,"""Nobody's even talking to me.  And.. the twins moved  out."""
Buffy,"""Why did you do it anyway?  No. I get why.  How?"""
Jonathan,"""After the thing with the bell tower and the gun, I  went to counseling.  You know other kids with problems a-and  one of them had this spell.  He glossed right over the monster. Well, anyway I just - I-I just wanted to apologize. Nobody was  supposed to get hurt."""
Buffy,"""Jonathan you get why everyone is angry though, right? It's not just the monster.  People didn't like being the little  actors in your sock puppet theater."""
Jonathan,"""You weren't!  You weren't socks!  We were friends."""
Buffy,"""Jonathan you can't keep trying to make everything work  out with some big gesture all at once.  Things are complicated. They take time and work."""
Jonathan,"""Yeah, right."""
Jonathan,"""Hey.  Hey Buffy.  You remember I gave you some  advice?"""
Jonathan,"""Uh, no about you and Riley.  I mean things are  starting to blur but this cool thing I said, um, that I don't  really remember...  I think it's right.  I think it's kind of  the same thing you just said to me.  (Pause.)  About things  taking work."""
