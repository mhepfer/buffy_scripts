WILLOW,<br>  Got it.
DAWN,"<br>  Do what everyone else does, wear what everyone else wears, say what everyone   else says."
WILLOW,<br>  OK.
DAWN,<br>    People may say something to you you don't understand. Just don't be afraid     to keep your mouth shut and pretend like you know what they're saying.
WILLOW,"<br>  (laughs) You know, Dawn, I've been to college before."
DAWN,<br>  People may say something like &quot;My protein window closes in an hour.&quot;   Just nod and smile. Mm-hmm. Turns out it has something to do with fitness.
BUFFY,<br>  Have you talked to her lately?
XANDER,<br>  Not since that night with the Gnarl demon. And that wasn't exactly the kind   of &quot;how have you been&quot; kind of talk. More of the &quot;pierce its   eye with something sharp&quot; kind of talking. I'm thinking I should call her.
BUFFY,<br>  I just don't want you to get your hopes up.
XANDER,"<br>  Hopes? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. There are no hopes. Anya and I are done. I love   being single. I'm a strong, successful male who is giddy at the thought of all   the women I will no doubt be dating in the near future."

XANDER,"<br>  I just worry about her, that's all."
WILLOW,<br>  Anya?
XANDER,"<br>  Yeah, she seems so sad."
DAWN,<br>  She should try acting like everybody else more.
WILLOW,<br>  Apparently it's what all the kids are doing nowadays.
BUFFY,"<br>  Well, I'm not sure I get the sad vibe, but there's definitely a vengeance vibe   worth worrying about."
XANDER,"<br>  Oh, that? No, no. I don't worry about that. She was hurt and she just turned   back to what she knew when I&#151; you know. But that's not her anymore."
BUFFY,<br>  I hope you're right.
XANDER,"<br>    Well, she turned that worm guy back before any real damage happened, right?     It'll just take some time. I really think she's coming around."

OLAF,"<br>  I am fine. Really. I could go for some mead, though."

OLAF,"<br>  Ah, yes. Mead."
ANYA,"<br>  The rapid reproductive rate of our rabbits...has given me an idea. I can give   the excess out to the townspeople, exchanging them not for goods or services,   but for goodwill and the sense of accomplishment that stems from selflessly   giving of yourself to others."
OLAF,"<br>  Ha, ha, ha! Sweet Aud! Your logic is insane and happenstance, like that of a   troll. It is no wonder that the bar matrons talk of you."
ANYA,<br>  You've been to the bar...
OLAF,"<br>  (sighs) It is not my fault they don't take kindly to you. You speak your mind,   and are annoying. It's one of the things I love most about you."
ANYA,<br>  Was Rannveig there?
OLAF,"<br>  Bah! I've told you a thousand times; I have no interest in this Rannveig. Her   hips are large and load bearing, like a Baltic woman. Your hips are narrow,   like a Baltic woman from a slightly more arid region. You are my perfect Aud.   I could never want for another."

XANDER,<br>  When? Just now? Took you all of ten seconds to decide to kill one of your best   friends?
BUFFY,"<br>  The thought that it might come to this has occurred to me before. It's occurred   to you, too."
XANDER,"<br>  But we can change what she did. Fix it. These are mystical deaths, right? There   has to be something."
WILLOW,<br>  I don't have anywhere near that kind of power. I didn't have that kind of power   when&#151; And I-I don't think I trust the power I do have.
BUFFY,"<br>    (to Willow) It's OK. (turns to Xander) Xander, I know this is hard for you     to hear, but it's what I have to do."
XANDER,"<br>  Hard for me to hear? Buffy, you wanna kill Anya!"
BUFFY,<br>  I don't want to.
XANDER,"<br>  Then don't! This isn't new ground for us. When our friends go all crazy and   start killing people, we help them. (looks at Willow)"
WILLOW,<br>  Sitting right here.
XANDER,<br>  I'm sorry. But it's true.
BUFFY,<br>  It's different.
XANDER,"<br>  Because you don't care about her the same way I do. Buffy, I still love her."
BUFFY,<br>    I know. And that's why you can't see this for what it really is. Willow was     different. She's a human. Anya's a demon.
XANDER,<br>  And you're the slayer. I see now how it's all very simple.
BUFFY,<br>  It is never simple.
XANDER,"<br>  (stands) No, of course not. You know, if there's a mass-murdering demon that   you're, oh, say, boning, then it's all gray area."
BUFFY,<br>  Spike was harmless. He was helping.
XANDER,<br>  He had no choice.
BUFFY,<br>  And Anya did! She chose to become a demon. Twice.
XANDER,<br>  You have no idea what she's going through.
BUFFY,<br>  (stands) I don't care what she's going through!
XANDER,"<br>  No, of course not. You think we haven't seen all this before? The part where   you just cut us all out. Just step away from everything human and act like you're   the law. If you knew what I felt&#151;"
BUFFY,<br>  I killed Angel! Do you even remember that? I would have given up everything   I had to be with&#151; I loved him more than I will ever love anything in this life.   And I put a sword through his heart because I had to.
WILLOW,<br>  And that all worked out OK.
BUFFY,<br>  Do you remember cheering me on? Both of you. Do you remember giving me Willow's   message: Kick his ass.
WILLOW,<br>  I never said that&#151;
XANDER,<br>  This is different&#151;
BUFFY,"<br>  It is always different! It's always complicated. And at some point, someone   has to draw the line, and that is always going to be me. You get down on me   for cutting myself off, but in the end the slayer is always cut off. There's   no mystical guidebook. No all-knowing council. Human rules don't apply. There's   only me. I am the law."
XANDER,<br>  There has to be another way.
BUFFY,<br>  Then please find it.
WILLOW,<br>  I can't. I'm sorry.

WILLOW,"<br>  Hello, D'Hoffryn."
D'HOFFRYN,"<br>  I figured I'd be hearing from you soon. The flaying of Warren Meers? Oh, truly   inspired. That was water cooler vengeance. Lloyd has a sketch of it on his wall."
WILLOW,<br>  That's not me anymore.
D'HOFFRYN,"<br>  Is that right? So, I didn't feel your presence earlier today? I didn't feel   a bit of the old you?"
WILLOW,<br>  We need to talk about Anya.
D'HOFFRYN,<br>  (growls) Very well. Let's talk about Anyanka.

ANYA,<br>  What do you want?
XANDER,<br>  I want to help you.
ANYA,"<br>  (sighs, walks away) Everyone is so considerate today. I should've slaughtered   people weeks ago."
XANDER,<br>  I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything I did to you. Everything I put you through.
ANYA,<br>  Thank you. All better. Thank goodness you got here in time.
XANDER,<br>  You don't understand. This isn't an intervention. Buffy's coming to kill you.
ANYA,<br>  She's coming to try.
XANDER,<br>  Did everybody have their crazy flakes today? You guys are friends. How could   you talk like this?
ANYA,"<br>  I have a job to do. And so does Buffy. Xander, you've always seen what you wanted   to. But you knew, sooner or later, it would come to this."
XANDER,"<br>  (Buffy enters, he turns to face her) Buffy, get out of here."
BUFFY,"<br>  Get out of my way, Xander."
XANDER,<br>  No. (turns back to Anya)
ANYA,"<br>  (in demon face) Get out of her way, Xander."
ANYA,"<br>  This is getting to be a pattern with you, Buffy. Are there any friends of your   left you haven't tried to kill? (fighting) C'mon, Buffy. Don't you have a clever   retort for me? (fighting)"
BUFFY,"<br>  Anya, I'm sorry. (stands)"
ANYA,"<br>  You're apologizing to me. What fight are you watching? Or is this like one of   your little pop-culture references I don't get, 'cause I'm a vengeance&#151;"

XANDER,<br>  Anya!
ANYA,"<br>    Forgotten how much swords through the chest hurt. (pulls it out) Aaahh! (breathes     heavily) You know better than that, Buffy. It takes a lot more to kill a vengeance     demon."

It's like somebody slaughtered   an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog. (Buffy stands and grabs her sword) Easy now.   I'd be gone before you could swing. (sighs, offers a hand to Anya to help her   stand) Isn't that just like a slayer. Solving all her problems by sticking things   with sharp objects. I talked to your friend, Miss Rosenberg. She's a firebrand.   I have high hopes for her."
XANDER,<br>  Stay away from Willow.
D'HOFFRYN,"<br>  (to Anya) Oh, he's gallant, isn't he. I understand what you saw in him. (to   all) Look, Miss Rosenberg seems to think Anyanka would be better suited outside   the vengeance fold. I think we already know what Lady HacksAway wants. And the   young man, he sees with the eyeballs of love. But I'm not sure if anyone's bothered   to find out what Anyanka herself really wants."
XANDER,<br>  Her name is Anya.
D'HOFFRYN,"<br>  Actually, funny historical side-bar, her original name was&#151;"
ANYA,<br>  (crying) I wanna take it back.
D'HOFFRYN,<br>  I'm sorry. What was that?
ANYA,<br>  I wanna take it back. I wanna undo what I did.
D'HOFFRYN,"<br>  Hmm. You want to take it back. Must be twelve bodies in there. Such a thing&#151;not   easily done. But not impossible. You're a big girl, Anyanka. You understand   how this works. The proverbial scales must balance. In order to restore the   lives of the victims, the fates require a sacrifice. The life and soul of a   vengeance demon."
ANYA,<br>  Do it.
XANDER,<br>  Wait!
ANYA,<br>  Stay out of this Xander.
XANDER,"<br>  OK, all right. That seems smart. He just said you have to die! Perhaps there's   some sort of alternate price."
ANYA,"<br>  Xander, you can't help me. I'm not even sure there's a me to help. (to D'Hoffryn)   I understand the price. Do it."
D'HOFFRYN,<br>  You're sure? This is your wish?
ANYA,<br>  This is my wish. Undo what I did.

D'HOFFRYN,"<br>  Like you were mine? Haven't I taught you anything, Anya? Never go for the kill   when you can go for the pain. (Xander starts for D'Hoffryn, but Buffy stops   him) Hold him back, Slayer. Wouldn't want anyone to get hurt. I've got plenty   of girls. There will always be vengeance demons. But now you, Anya, you're out.   Congratulations. You're wish is granted."
ANYA,<br>  You should've killed me.
