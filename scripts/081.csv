GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer...
DAWN VOICEOVER,No one knows who I am. Not the real me. No one understands. No one has an older sister who's a slayer.
BUFFY,I know it's always been this way. She's the baby.
BUFFY,"But for some reason lately, it's just really getting to me."
RILEY,"Well, yeah. You're like her idol, Buffy."
ANYA,What do you think you're doing?
DAWN,Leave me alone.
ANYA,I will after you come back inside the house. (Grabs Dawn and starts shoving her back toward the door.)
DAWN,Let go of me! (breaks free)
ANYA,"No, it's not safe out here!"
XANDER,Anya!
RILEY,This head wound looks bad. We gotta get her to the hospital.
XANDER,"Wish I had something food-like to offer you guys, but the hot plate's out of commission."
ANYA,We think the cat peed on it.
XANDER,I do have Spaghetti-O's. Set 'em on top of the dryer and you're a fluff cycle away from lukewarm goodness. (Gestures at the dryer)
RILEY,"Hmm. Yeah, I had dryer food for lunch."
XANDER,"(looking up) Ah, I guess the folks are back."
XANDER,"No, no, I was wrong. Just incompetent burglars."
XANDER,"Yeah, maybe it's definitely time to start looking for a new place. Something a little nicer. Buffy, you've been to Hell. They have one-bedrooms, right?"
RILEY,"Hey Buffy, how's that book? Full of zippy dates and zesty names?"
BUFFY,(not listening) I'm fine.
BUFFY,Heyyy. I'm enjoying the studying.
RILEY,Who are you lately? Give it up and watch the movie.
BUFFY,"I guess it has been a long day with the crusades. I can take a little break from the violence for some (looks up at TV) ooh, fighting."
XANDER,Incompetently-dubbed kung fu. Our most valuable Chinese import.
ANYA,Much more durable than their hot plates.
RILEY,Just relax.
BUFFY,Mm ... mm. That feels good.
ANYA,Ow! What are you doing? I have a dislocated shoulder! (Xander stops rubbing. Riley stops rubbing Buffy's shoulders too.) I'm trying to concentrate on the kicking movie.
BUFFY,Hey! Rubbing went away.
RILEY,"Oh ... sorry, I got caught up in the action. (gesturing at TV)"
BUFFY,"Yeah, it's pretty good."
BUFFY,"Oh, give me a break! This is all wrong. See, first you would get the big guy, with a flying kick. Then you would take out all the little ones, bam, ba- see, now with the flying kick. (scornfully) From a dead stop! What's powering it, raw enthusiasm?"
RILEY,"Hey Buff, maybe you oughta leave the work behind sometimes. You're not always on slayer duty, you know?"
BUFFY,It would drive you crazy if we were watching an army movie and they were all saluting backwards and ... invading all willy-nilly.
BUFFY,"And anyway, I mean, you know, you can't blame me for being critical. Willow's the same way when we watch a, a movie about witches, right Xander?"
XANDER,"(distracted by the noise from upstairs) What? Oh yeah, she's all like, ""What's that, a cauldron? Who uses a cauldron any more?"""
TOTH,The last step in thy forging is my pain ... the price with which I purchase ... the death of the slayer.
WILLOW,"If you get the apartment, this'll be your hallway."
WILLOW,"We'll walk down this hall, and we'll say, ""La la, I'm on my way to Xander's."""
BUFFY,"Just warning you, Xander, I probably won't be doing that."
RILEY,Really? I will.
XANDER,"Hey, we're just lookin'. Rent's way high, so don't get your hopes all carbonated."
ANYA,But you have references.
XANDER,"No, I have Albert, which is me doing an important voice. (Does important voice) 'Xander Harris? An excellent tenant. And a very nice-looking fellow.'"
WILLOW,Whoa! Big!
BUFFY,"It's nice. And not subterranean. It's very, uh, above-terranean."
ANYA,I want it. Pay anything.
WOMAN,(OS) Xander Harris?
RILEY,"Uh, no, Riley Finn. (shakes her hand) This is Xander."
XANDER,Hey.
MANAGER,Ah.
XANDER,I brought my friends.
MANAGER,I see.
XANDER,They wouldn't always be around.
WILLOW,But we're clean and-and quiet.
ANYA,"(Standing in the living room, gesturing around) We can have the scooby meetings in the living room, and-and Giles can explain the boring things over there."
WILLOW,"(going into kitchen) Oh, there's a microwave! It would be like having hot and cold running popcorn."
MANAGER,"Phone and electricity are hooked up. There's a private balcony, ceiling fan, closet space... (sees Xander opening a door) And that's the bedroom."
XANDER,"Guys, you can't save it for the bedroom?"
XANDER,"Okay, good point."
MANAGER,I brought an application for you to fill out. (giving Xander a piece of paper)
XANDER,An application? I can't just ... tell you my references? Because there's Albert.
MANAGER,We run your credit check based on the application.
XANDER,"Oh! Credit check. (nervously, to the others) Little check on the credit. See how credible my checks are. (Laughs nervously. The others laugh politely.)"
MANAGER,"And we'll be asking for first, last, security, and a small cleaning deposit. The total's at the bottom of the sheet there."
ANYA,"(to Manager) He'll take it. (to Xander) Xander, go get the furniture, I'll wait here. (to Manager) He's been living in his drunken parents' basement where something urinated on the hot plate."
XANDER,"(laughs nervously) Anya, can we talk quietly over there? (to Manager) Excuse us."
RILEY,"Uh, we, uh ... we like the ceiling fan."
WILLOW,"Yes. It's very, you know, kind of old south."
BUFFY,But without the unpleasant slavery associations.
ANYA,(OS) But why can't we have it?
XANDER,"(quietly) I told you, my construction job is ending, and I won't have any more money coming in. And by the way, you do have your own place."
ANYA,"So when I wanna visit you, I have to be in that awful basement?"
XANDER,Not forever. Just until things come together.
ANYA,"Which is when, Xander? 'Cause right now, things are looking pretty untogether, and you can't expect me just to wait around for- (Her voice rises and the others try not to notice)"
XANDER,"Quiet, please. Anya, what is this? What's going on with you?"
ANYA,(loudly) What's going on with me is my arm hurts ... and I'm tired ... and I don't really feel like taking a tour of beautiful things I can't have.
XANDER,(with a big fake smile) I guess I'll just start on that application. I think you'll like it. I've been told I have lovely penmanship.
GILES,"(to himself) ""Miscellaneous curses."" (laughs, picks up something unidentifiable from the box) Brilliant. Be lucky if I don't curse my hands off at the wrist."
GILES,Oh!
TOTH,(raising his stick) The slayer is not here.
GILES,"Rabbit's foot, no, wait... (Tosses it aside and looks in the box for something else. Toth brushes the box out of Giles' hands. Giles gasps and holds up a wooden statue about a foot and a half high.)"
TOTH,"That is a fertility god. (Giles looks at it in dismay) Feeble man, you are not going to distract me-"
TOTH,(pointing the stick at Giles) You are not the slayer. (Giles rolls over and looks up at him) You do not concern me.
GILES,Like this ... and this ... and this...
RILEY,That thing's pretty heavy.
WILLOW,That's Oofdar. Goddess of childbirth. She's got some nice heft to her.
BUFFY,How badly did you hurt him?
GILES,"Well, hurt, uh ... maybe not ... hurt."
WILLOW,"Well, I-I'm sure he was startled."
GILES,"Uh, yes, yes, I'd imagine it gave him, uh, rather a turn."
BUFFY,"(grinning) He ran away, huh?"
GILES,"Um, sort of more ... uh ... turned and swept out majestically, I suppose. He said I didn't concern him."
BUFFY,So a mythic triumph over a completely indifferent foe?
GILES,"(insulted) Well, I'm not dead or unconscious, so I say bravo for me."
WILLOW,(holding up a book) Some good demons in this one. See if your guy's in here.
XANDER,"So you bought the magic shop and you were attacked before it opened. Who's up for a swingin' chorus of the ""We told you so"" symphony?"
RILEY,(hefting the Oofdar statue) Owning this place does seem kinda dangerous. (takes a few experimental swings)
GILES,(looking up from the book) Toth.
RILEY,What?
BUFFY,"He called you a Toth. It's a British expression. It means, like, moron."
GILES,"No, Toth is the name of the demon. (Sees Xander holding a crystal) Be careful with that. (Xander looks around at the others, puts the crystal down carefully) Ancient demon. Very strong. Last survivor of the Tothric clan. It also says that for a demon he's unusually sophisticated."
BUFFY,Sophisticated. So I should discuss men's fashions with him before I chop his head off?
GILES,"(exasperated) They're referring to the fact that he does not fight bare-handed. He uses tools, devices. Oh, he's also supposed to be very focused. And since he mentioned the slayer, I think we know what the focus is."
RILEY,"He mentioned Buffy? Where do we find him, and how hard can I kill him?"
GILES,"(consulting book) Well, there's no mention of the types of places he might frequent, but ... (closes book and stands up) I have an idea. (Walks around, talking thoughtfully) He had a very specific olfactory presence."
XANDER,"Well, I guess we're off to the olfactory. I hate that place. (Everyone rolls their eyes at him) I'm joking, I know what it means. He smelled. (uncertainly) Right?"
WILLOW,Some demon rituals involve anointing with oils. Was it sort of ... sandalwoody?
GILES,"Um ... not even remotely. But he was very, um... distinctive."
BUFFY,The city dump. Where smells go to relax and be themselves.
RILEY,People say they're recycling. (shakes head) They're not recycling. (Xander pats him on the shoulder)
WILLOW,"I found a spell so you can't smell anything, but it does it by taking your nose off, so ... no."
RILEY,"What are *you* doing here, Spike? (We see that Riley has a crossbow)"
SPIKE,"Oh, there's a nice lady vampire who set up a charming tea room over the next pile of crap. What do you think I'm doing? I'm scavenging, ain't I? (Holds up a small lamp in the other hand)"
WILLOW,Very pretty.
GILES,"Spike, um ... we're looking for a demon, um... tall, robed, skin sort of hanging off. Deep voice?"
SPIKE,You mean a great tall robe-y thing like that one? (Pointing behind them)
RILEY,Take cover!
SPIKE,Big guy! Kick her ass!
SPIKE,"Oh, very nice! I was on your side! (angrily tosses the pieces of lamp aside)"
XANDER,Watch out!
RILEY,"Hey, you okay?"
XANDER,I'm okay.
WILLOW,"Buffy, he's gone."
XANDER,I'm fine.
RILEY,"Easy, easy."
RILEY,He disappeared.
RILEY,That had to hurt.
XANDER,"Yeah, yeah."
GILES,Take it slowly.
<blockquote><b>NOTE,"from this point on the two Xanders are referred to herein as ""ScruffyXander"" and ""SuaveXander.""</b></blockquote>"
ScruffyXANDER,Anya ... you trying to use the hot plate again?
ScruffyXANDER,Uh-oh.
ScruffyXANDER,Anya? An?
ScruffyXANDER,(peering in window) Oh my god!
ScruffyXANDER,(OS) What? No way! Who is ... me?
ScruffyXANDER,What am I doing in there? Buffy. Need Buffy.
ScruffyXANDER,"(into phone) No, it ate my quarter. Uh-huh. But see, I'm sort of having this aggressively bad day. (pulls quarter out of pocket) Ooh! I found a quarter! I found a quarter! ... Well, ma'am, for me it *is* worth getting excited about."
ScruffyXANDER,"Come on, Buffy."
BUFFY,(on phone) Hello?
BUFFY,They hung up.
BUFFY,"Well, if this guy wants to fight with weapons, I've got it covered from A to Z. From axe to ... zee other axe. (Riley looks tense. She walks over to him.) Relax. Another day, another demon."
RILEY,Right. It'll be good.
BUFFY,Hey.
DAWN,My friend Sharon's older brother knows a girl who died because she choked on her boyfriend's tongue.
BUFFY,"(annoyed) Go away, Dawn. (Riley looks amused)"
DAWN,I'm not in your room. I'm in the hallway. The hallway doesn't belong to you.
BUFFY,(moving toward the door) Get *out* of here.
DAWN,"Mom, I can stand in the hallway, right?"
BUFFY,She's watching us like a big freak!
JOYCE,"(sighs, puts hand to her forehead) This must be my ""two teenage girls in the house"" headache. I thought it felt familiar."
BUFFY,"Good work, Dawn. You gave her a headache."
DAWN,"I did not! (to Joyce) Did I give you a headache, Mom? I'm sure part of it is Buffy's."
BUFFY,But part of it is Dawn's.
JOYCE,"It's so nice you've learned to share. You girls, sort this out yourselves. It's good for you. (Exits. Buffy looks annoyed.)"
DAWN,(smiling smugly) She didn't say I couldn't stand here.
BUFFY,(smiling smugly) Hmm.
DAWN,(OS) Ow!
SPIKE,Very posh.
SPIKE,"Oh, slayer. (Rubs his thumb along its cheek) One of these days...."
BOSS,Hey Harris! (No reaction. Boss yells louder.) Harris!
SuaveXANDER,"(turns off tool) Harris, right. Yeah."
BOSS,"In my trailer, okay? I'm talking to all the guys today. The job's winding down."
SuaveXANDER,"Right, I'll ... be right there."
ScruffyXANDER,"(muttering) Welcome to payback, mister evil-plan-face-stealer. You take my life, you get my being fired absolutely free."
GUY,Harris. Where's your hard hat?
BOSS,Sit down.
BOSS,"How long you work here, Harris?"
SuaveXANDER,Huh? I'm not sure.
BOSS,About three months?
SuaveXANDER,"I guess, yeah."
BOSS,"(OS) And you haven't done much construction work before this, is that right?"
ScruffyXANDER,I knew they were gonna notice that.
BOSS,"I have to tell you, that's surprising ... 'cause your work here has been first-rate. Yeah, we have another job lined up in Carlton when you're finished here."
BOSS,You ever think about staying on full-time?
ScruffyXANDER,What? Why isn't he firing me? ... Him?
BOSS,"I was thinking that I'd have you head up our interior carpentry crew ... (Closeup of the shiny thing in SuaveXander's hand, reflecting the light.) ...see how it goes. It's more responsibility, but the pay is better."
SuaveXANDER,(enthusiastically) That would be *great*.
ScruffyXANDER,"Promotion? But I ... I mean, he didn't ... Doesn't he see the shiny thing? (Gestures angrily at the window. This causes him to lose his balance and fall off his perch.)"
BOSS,"Congratulations, Harris. You and your girl should go out and celebrate."
SuaveXANDER,I already have an idea how.
MANAGER,"I was going to call you, Mr. Harris, let you know your credit checked out fine, but ... I really didn't think you'd be back."
ScruffyXANDER,"""Mister Harris."" Yeah, right."
MANAGER,I'm sure you'll like the building....
MANAGER,(smiling) ...I think someone said you're currently in your parents' basement?
SuaveXANDER,"Right. There comes a point where you either have to move on, or just buy yourself a Klingon costume and ... go with it."
MANAGER,"Well ... (picking up documents) I hope you'll be happy here, Mr. Harris. We're certainly happy to have you."
SuaveXANDER,Thank you. (We see that he's doing the trick with the shiny thing again.)
MANAGER,"And if you ... need anything ... day, or night ... please. Call me."
MANAGER,"I, um ... I'm leaving my home number here..."
ScruffyXANDER,She's coming on to him ... me!
MANAGER,"Call me. (hands SuaveXander her card) Even for, you know ... non-business stuff. Maybe we could, uh, do something?"
ScruffyXANDER,"Please, lady, that is so not me. He's too clean for one thing. And his socks are all matchy."
MANAGER,(in doorway) Remember ... any time.
SuaveXANDER,"Anya, you there? ... Look, I know you're still mad, but ... I figure you're probably sitting there pretending you're not home but listening anyway."
ANYA,Am not.
SuaveXANDER,"Look, I have something to show you. Meet me at the apartment."
SuaveXANDER,(on machine) You know the one. Nine o'clock. (Beep)
ScruffyXANDER,Yaah!
ScruffyXANDER,I won't let you do this!
NEIGHBOR WOMAN,(OS) What's going on down there?
ScruffyXANDER,You can't do this to me!
ScruffyXANDER,"Oh, man, I need Buffy."
SuaveXANDER,"(OS) No, no. He looked *exactly* like me."
SuaveXANDER,"It stole my face. We have to find it, and we have to kill it."
ScruffyXANDER,"She sees it's not me. Please, Buffy ... resist his spell. Do this for me."
BUFFY,"(to SuaveXander) Don't worry, Xander. Whatever stole your face, it has to deal with the slayer now."
ScruffyXANDER,"Don't be scared, Will. Just listen. It's me, Xander."
ScruffyXANDER,And I can prove it.
WILLOW,Um ... okay. (Sits on the bed)
ScruffyXANDER,"Let's see. (paces) Stuff only you and me know. Okay! On my seventh birthday ... I wanted a toy fire truck, and I didn't get it, and you were real nice about it, and then the house next door burnt down, and then real fire trucks came, and for years I thought you set the fire for me. And if you did, you can tell me. (grins nervously. Willow doesn't respond. He paces more.) For a while last year, I thought I was lactose-intolerant, but it was just some bad Brie. Oh! (points at Willow) Every Christmas, we watch Charlie Brown together, and I do the Snoopy dance."
WILLOW,(smiling) Xander ... stop dancing.
ScruffyXANDER,Aha! You called me Xander!
WILLOW,"Xander, shut up! Why wouldn't I think you were Xander?"
ScruffyXANDER,Oh. Huh.
WILLOW,What's goin' on?
ScruffyXANDER,(sighs) Okay. I woke up in the dump this morning.
WILLOW,"Xander, the basement isn't a dump. It, it's more like a really nice hovel."
ScruffyXANDER,"No. The dump. The city dump. I got hit last night, fall down boom, woke up this morning."
WILLOW,"Nuh uh! We walked you home last night, remember? (Sits down on bed again)"
ScruffyXANDER,You walked? Will. Did I do anything weird? Did I wave any shiny things around?
WILLOW,"Shiny things, what are you talking about?"
ScruffyXANDER,"Last night, that wasn't me. There's a double out there. Some ... thing has stolen my face, and it's going around pretending to be me, and it's hypnotizing people. It even got to Buffy and Giles and Riley. It's over there right now and they have no idea."
GILES,"What's intriguing me is that there are any number of demons with the ability to mimic a simple form, but, uh ... this sounds like more than that."
SuaveXANDER,Hold up. Do we really have to figure out what it is? Let's just go kill it.
RILEY,"Yeah. When the imposter's killed, the body'll probably turn back into whatever it really is, and then we'll know."
BUFFY,Toth!
BUFFY,The demon with the creepy stick thing.
SuaveXANDER,(thoughtfully) Toth.
BUFFY,"It's gotta be! He hit Xander with that blast, and somehow it allowed him to take Xander's form. Couldn't that be what the creepy stick thing did?"
GILES,"Yes ... I suppose, yes, yes, it makes sense. A shape-shifting device. (Moves offscreen toward his bookshelves)"
SuaveXANDER,It does make sense. It must be Toth.
ScruffyXANDER,(angrily) It's a robot. It's an evil robot constructed from evil parts that look like me designed to do evil.
WILLOW,Uh huh. Or it's Toth.
ScruffyXANDER,"(still angrily) Or, it's Toth."
BUFFY,I was gonna look for Toth anyway. Guess now I start ... looking for you.
SuaveXANDER,Should I go with you? I ... told Anya to meet me at my new place. I'd feel a whole lot better knowing she's safe from this creep.
BUFFY,"Go be with her. I, I mean, if you were out there looking for the double too ... (looks at Riley, then back at SuaveXander) let's just say that I wouldn't wanna run into you and kill the wrong one."
SuaveXANDER,"Good thinking. When you kill this thing, you better make sure you got the one's who's actually-"
ScruffyXANDER,"A demon. A demon has taken my life from me, and he's living it better than I do."
WILLOW,"Well, we're working on it. There has to be a way to get to Buffy to ... unhypnotize her. I'll find a spell to snap her out of it. (Stands up and goes to her bookcase)"
ScruffyXANDER,(sourly) Right. Whatever.
WILLOW,"(turns back to him) Xander, you sound a little ... you have to help me figure this out, you know."
ScruffyXANDER,But I never help. I get in trouble and Buffy saves me.
WILLOW,That's not true! Sometimes we all helped save you. (realizes that was unhelpful) And sometimes you're not in trouble.
ScruffyXANDER,"I'm just ... another great humiliation. (Willow looks sympathetic) But this time it's even worse. This demon, he's like taking my life, and everyone's treating him ... Everyone's treating him like a grown-up! Will, I'm starting to feel like..."
WILLOW,Like what?
ScruffyXANDER,"Like ... he's doing everything better. He's smarter, and ... (shakes head) I don't know, maybe I should just let him have it. Take my life, please."
WILLOW,"Xander, no! (Puts hand on his shoulder) You're just tired, and ... and all soggy. That's why it seems so hard, but you can't let him just take your whole existence."
ScruffyXANDER,"Why not? It's not like I was doing anything so great with it. When I get to the pearly gates I'm sure the guy is not gonna go, ""Hey, what a kick-ass comic book collection, come on in!"" (Willow still looking sympathetic) No, what have I got that's even worth- (eyes widen) Anya!"
WILLOW,You think he's after her?
ScruffyXANDER,"She won't know. He can just ... no. No way! (Jumps up) No way. He can take anything, but he can't have her. I need her."
WILLOW,"(half disgusted, half smiling) Really?"
ScruffyXANDER,"(desperately) He could be with her right now! Figure out a spell, something ... revealy. I gotta find her. (Turns to leave)"
WILLOW,"Xander.... (He turns back) You already knew he was taking over your life, and ... you didn't think about Anya till just now?"
ScruffyXANDER,"Hey, wait till you have an evil twin. See how you handle it. (Exits)"
WILLOW,(pouts) I handled it fine.
ScruffyXANDER,Anya? An?
SuaveXANDER: (on machine) Meet me at the apartment. You know the one. 9,00.
ScruffyXANDER,It's gotta be here. Where is it?
ANYA,You're lying. It's a trick.
SuaveXANDER,No. Trust me.
ANYA,You really got this apartment?
SuaveXANDER,I really did. And do you know why?
ANYA,The ceiling fans? Very attractive.
SuaveXANDER,No. It's because I knew you wanted it. It's all for you.
SuaveXANDER,"Anya, you didn't see me today, did you? I mean, we didn't talk?"
ANYA,"What do you mean? I just got your phone message, that's all."
SuaveXANDER,Good.
ANYA,So... what happens next?
SuaveXANDER,"Well, at some point we take off our clothes."
ANYA,I mean what happens next in our lives? When do we get a car?
SuaveXANDER,(confused) A car?
ANYA,"And a boat. No, wait, I - I don't mean a boat. I mean a puppy. Or a child. I have a list somewhere."
SuaveXANDER,What are you talking about?
ANYA,Just ... we have to get going. I don't have time just to let these things happen.
SuaveXANDER,There's no hurry.
ANYA,"Yes there is. There's a hurry, Xander. I'm dying."
ANYA,I may have as few as fifty years left.
SuaveXANDER,"Fifty years? What is thi- Oh, wait a minute. This is about this. (Touching her arm sling)"
ANYA,What about the sling?
SuaveXANDER,You haven't been hurt like this since you became human. (She nods reluctantly) Maybe it's finally hitting you what being human means.
ANYA,"(pouting) No, that's not it."
SuaveXANDER,"Yes, I think it is. You were gonna live for thousands of years. (Anya nods) And now you're gonna age and die. That must be terrifying."
ANYA,You don't understand what it's like.
SuaveXANDER,Being suddenly human? I think I can get what that would be like. And we can get through it together.
ANYA,You can't make it any different. I'm going to get old. And ... you can't promise you'll be with me when I'm ... wrinkly and my teeth are artificial and stuck into my wrinkly mouth with an adhesive.
SuaveXANDER,"No, I can't promise that. But it doesn't sound terrible. And that's saying something. (Anya looks somewhat comforted) I promise you, Anya. Very soon you won't be thinking about getting older."
ScruffyXANDER,Get away from her!
ANYA,Xander!
ANYA,(to SuaveXander) Xander!
SuaveXANDER,(to ScruffyXander) Get out. You don't belong here.
ScruffyXANDER,Anya. It's me.
SuaveXANDER,"It's a demon. He stole my face, he's trying to trick you."
SuaveXANDER,"Anya, you know I'm me, right?"
ScruffyXANDER,No!
ANYA,What is it? Make it go away.
RILEY,So you're thinking we split up?
BUFFY,"Yeah, you check the places where he might try and go and blend in as Xander. I'll check the places where Toth might hang out."
GILES,"I swear, this time I *know* I had that locked."
WILLOW,"Buffy, Toth looks like Xander."
RILEY,We already know. We're on our way.
BUFFY,"Wait a second, how did you know about this?"
WILLOW,"He came to me. I-I mean Xander did. And he's in terrible shape, we need to help him."
RILEY,He came to us too.
WILLOW,"No. We each had a Xander. I mean ... you didn't have a Xander, you had a, a demon in a Xander suit."
BUFFY,What makes you so sure that yours is the right one?
WILLOW,"He knew stuff! He, he did the Snoopy dance. (Another shot of Giles reading) Buffy, it was Xander, and he needs us."
GILES,"Oh, dear lord."
RILEY,"Buffy, our Xander, did he seem a little-"
BUFFY,He seemed kind of forceful and confident.
WILLOW,That's not Xander.
GILES,"I said, ""Oh, dear lord."""
BUFFY,You always say that.
GILES,"Well, it's always important! (coming forward to join them, carrying book) Neither Xander is a demon."
WILLOW,Um ... is one of them a robot?
GILES,"What? No. Um, uh, the rod device, it's called a ferula-gemina. It splits one person in half, distilling personality traits into two separate bodies. As near as I can tell, Toth was attempting to split the slayer into two different entities. (Hands the book to Willow)"
BUFFY,Two Buffys?
GILES,"Yes. One with all the qualities inherent in Buffy Summers, and the other one with everything that belongs to the slayer alone ... the, uh, the-the strength, the, uh, speed, the heritage. And when it hit Xander, I think it separated him into his strongest points and his (grimaces) weakest."
RILEY,But which one's the real one?
GILES,They're both real. They're both Xander. Neither one of them is evil. There's nothing in either of them that our Xander doesn't already possess.
RILEY,"I still don't get the original plan. I mean, why do it? The slayer half would be like slayer concentrate, pretty unkillable."
GILES,"But the two halves can't exist without each other. Kill the weaker Buffy half, and the slayer half dies."
BUFFY,"So the same goes for the Xanders. We lose one, we lose them both."
ScruffyXANDER,He's the demon! (Anya looks uncertainly at SuaveXander) Or possibly a robot. Look at me. Look in my eyes. Can't you see it's me?
ANYA,"I, I don't know!"
ScruffyXANDER,(desperately) Please! Look at him! Listen to him! He's all smooth! You have to know it's me!
SuaveXANDER,"Don't worry, Anya. I'll get rid of this thing. I'm thinkin' this is gonna last about fifteen seconds. (Walks slowly toward ScruffyXander)"
ScruffyXANDER,I'm thinkin' less.
ANYA,No! Don't shoot him!
BUFFY,"Can't this thing go any faster? Ultimate driving machine, my ass."
RILEY,We're pushing 70.
BUFFY,"Riley, do you wish-"
RILEY,No.
BUFFY,No? You don't even know what I was gonna say.
RILEY,"Yes, I do. You wanted to know if I wished you got hit by the ferula-gemina, got split in two."
BUFFY,"Well, you have been kind of rankly about the whole slayer gig. Instead of having slayer Buffy, you could have Buffy Buffy."
RILEY,"Hey. I *have* Buffy Buffy. Being the slayer's part of who you are. You keep thinking I don't get that, but..."
BUFFY,"It's just ... I know how ... un-fun it can be. The bad hours, frequent bruising, cranky monsters..."
RILEY,"Buffy... if you led a perfectly normal life, you wouldn't be half as crazy as you are. I gotta have that. I gotta have it all. I'm talkin' toes, elbows, the whole bad-ice-skating-movie obsession, everything. There's no part of you I'm not in love with."
BUFFY,"We better get there soon. If Xander kills himself, he's dead. (frowns) You know what I mean."
ScruffyXANDER,Let go! I have to kill the demon-bot!
SuaveXANDER,Anya ... get out of the way.
BUFFY,Xander!
SuaveXANDER,"(smiling) All right, Buffy. I have him."
ScruffyXANDER,No! Buffy! I'm me! Help me!
ANYA,My gun! He's got my gun! (Pointing to the gun in SuaveXander's hand)
RILEY,You own a gun??
BUFFY,Xander ... gun-holding Xander. (Walks quickly over to SuaveXander) Give me the gun.
ANYA,"Buffy, which one's real?"
ScruffyXANDER,I am.
SuaveXANDER,"No, I am."
SuaveXANDER,Thank you.
SuaveXANDER,Ow!
RILEY,Wild.
BUFFY,"Yeah. Okay, Xander ... Xa ... (sighs) You've been split in two. But you're both Xander. And you *can't* kill each other. Um, well, you could, but it would be really bad."
SuaveXANDER,No way.
ScruffyXANDER,He can't be me. He's all ... fancy.
RILEY,We can prove that you're both Xander.
BUFFY,Yeah! (to Riley) How?
RILEY,Um...
BUFFY,Um...
RILEY,"Well, there has to be a way."
BUFFY,Ooh! What number am I thinking of?
RILEY,I don't think that's gonna do it.
XANDERS,(in unison) Eleven and a half.
BUFFY,Wrong. Oh! But see?
ScruffyXANDER,No. We're not the same. We're all different.
RILEY,"Different properties went into each of you, but you're both Xander."
ANYA,Different properties?
ScruffyXANDER,What different properties?
BUFFY,"Uh, uh, you know, uh, sense of direction. Good night vision, stuff like that."
ScruffyXANDER,"Oh, but he has a thingie! In his pocket! (pointing to SuaveXander's pocket) A shiny disk that stuns and disorients!"
SuaveXANDER,"(reaching in pocket, taking out the thing) What disk?"
ScruffyXANDER,Cover your eyes! (covering eyes with hands)
SuaveXANDER,This?
ScruffyXANDER,It'll melt your brain!
BUFFY,(to ScruffyXander) Look.
SuaveXANDER,(tolerantly) It's a nickel someone flattened on the railroad track. I found it on the construction site and I thought it was cool. It's not magic.
ScruffyXANDER,"No, I ... huh. It *is* kinda cool. (SuaveXander nods tolerantly)Washington's still there, but he's all smushy. (looks more closely) And he may be Jefferson."
ANYA,"Okay, isn't anyone gonna tell me why there are two Xanders?"
BUFFY,I will on the way to Giles'. Let's go.
BUFFY,Oh great. Rod boy.
TOTH,"I will not miss again, slayer."
ScruffyXANDER,"(standing behind SuaveXander, clutching him around the shoulders) The gun! Pick up the little gun pieces!"
SuaveXANDER,"Hey, I just made a small cleaning deposit!"
BUFFY,Sword!
SuaveXANDER,"Oh, yeah. That cleaning deposit's gone."
ScruffyXANDER,"(gasps) I was thinking the same thing! Hey, do you suppose we're both Xander?"
ScruffyXANDER,"Look and admire, ladies."
BUFFY,"(looking closely) Look, there's a scar there, (pointing at ScruffyXander's forehead) and there's the same one right there. (pointing at SuaveXander's forehead)"
WILLOW,"It's all double. (pointing) This zit, and this ... kinda funny dippy thing. A-and this weird little hair that grows in the wrong way (pointing to ScruffyXander's nose)"
ScruffyXANDER,"Okay! Back off, ladies."
RILEY,"Psychologically, this is fascinating. Doesn't it make everyone wanna lock them in separate rooms and do experiments on them?"
RILEY,"Just me, then."
ANYA,"So ... you Xanders really do have all the same memories, all the same ... (looking downward) physical attributes? (Laughs suggestively)"
SuaveXANDER,We're completely identical.
ScruffyXANDER,"Yeah, we checked out some stuff in the car on the way over. (Anya frowns in puzzlement) Fingerprints!"
ANYA,"(turning to the others) Well, maybe we shouldn't do this reintegration thing right away. See, I can take the boys home, and ... we can all have sex together, and ... you know, just slap 'em back together in the morning."
SuaveXANDER,She's joking.
ScruffyXANDER,"No she's not! She entirely wants to have sex with us together. Which is ... *wrong*, and, and it would be very confusing."
GILES,"(getting up from the floor) Uh, uh, we just need to light the candles. Also, we should continue to pretend we heard none of the disturbing sex talk."
WILLOW,Check. Candles and pretense.
ANYA,It's not like it'd be cheating. They're both Xander.
ScruffyXANDER,"Now, hold on a sec. If you weren't putting a whammy on people with the shiny thing, how'd you do it? How'd you get the promotion?"
SuaveXANDER,"Well, I'm good at that stuff."
ScruffyXANDER,I am?
SuaveXANDER,Yeah.
ScruffyXANDER,"And hey, how 'bout that lady, huh? The apartment manager."
SuaveXANDER,"How weird was it when she called me ""mister""?"
WILLOW,We're ready. We should do it now. (The Xanders turn their grins toward her)
ANYA,What'll we do if this doesn't work?
XANDERS,"(unison) Kill us both, Spock! (They look at each other and laugh delightedly.)"
BUFFY,They're ... kinda the same now.
GILES,"Yes, he's clearly a bad influence on himself."
ScruffyXANDER,"Hey, summon the goddess. Chant the chant. Let's do it."
WILLOW,"Actually, it's not that hard. Your natural state is to be together. Toth's spell is doing all the work of keeping you apart. I just have to break it. So you two ... (takes them both and positions them inside the chalk markings) stand right here. Side by side. We don't want you to end up with two fronts, now do we?"
ScruffyXANDER,Are you sure you know how to do this?
WILLOW,(exhales) Here we go. Brace yourselves.
WILLOW,Let the spell be ended.
XANDER,"You gotta be kidding. ""Let the spell be ended,"" that's not gonna work."
XANDER,Oh!
ANYA,I liked it the other way. Put him back.
RILEY,Getting nostalgic?
XANDER,"I don't know. At first it's just a place, then you start to make memories, and ... then you're like, (pointing) that's where Spike slept, and (pointing) there, that's where Anya and I drowned the separvo demon. Oh! (points) and, and right there, that's where I got my heart all ripped out. (shakes head) I really hate this place."
BUFFY,Anya. I see you've joined the non-sling-wearing crowd.
ANYA,"(smiling) Yes, I'm feeling better. And I anticipate many years before my death. Excepting disease or airbag failure."
BUFFY,That sounds nice. (Walks off carrying box)
ANYA,Ooh! (tosses magazine aside) Presents?
XANDER,Not unless you want my collection of Babylon 5 commemorative plates. Which you cannot have. I just thought you could help carry a little.
ANYA,Me? (pouts) Buffy has super strength. Why don't we just load her up like one of those little horses?
XANDER,Anya. Please.
ANYA,(getting off stool) Fine. I'm just your slave. (Takes box and goes out)
XANDER,How is it that she can always make me feel SuaveXander's left the building?
RILEY,"You two have your friction, but ... she digs the whole package. It's obvious."
XANDER,"Still, I do envy you sometimes. (Riley looks up at him) I mean for the sanity. Not that I'm still into Buffy. (quickly) Not that I ever was."
"RILEY: (grinning) Hey, I'm well aware of how lucky I am. Like, lottery lucky. Buffy's like nobody else in the world. When I'm with her it's like ... it's like I'm split in two. Half of me is just ... on fire, going crazy if I'm not touching her. The other half ... is so still and peaceful ... just perfectly content. Just knows","this is the one. (Smiles a little, continues packing for a moment, then looks up at Xander again.) But she doesn't love me."
BUFFY,Got something else for me to carry?
RILEY,"Uh, you can help me pack this."
BUFFY,Sure. (goes over to Riley and kisses him) Sure.
Executive producer,Joss Whedon.
