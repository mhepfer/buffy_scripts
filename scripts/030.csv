character,dialogue
Buffy,Non-vampire. Plus two.
Willow,(sternly as she puts her cross away) Hi.
Xander,"Man, Buffy! My whole life just flashed before my eyes! (glances  over at Willow) I gotta get me a life!"
Buffy,What are you doing here?
Willow,What are *you* doing here?
Buffy,"Well, I'm patrolling!"
Willow,"(concerned) Buffy, you're sick."
Buffy,"No, I feel fine. I mean, I'm... the world's spinning a little  bit, but I like it, it's kinda like a ride."
Cordelia,"Half the school's out with this flu. It's a serious deal,  Buffy. We're all concerned about how gross you look."
Buffy,(with a hint of sarcasm) I'm touched. Really. But I have work to  do.
Willow,"Buffy, come on, one night of rest is not gonna kill you."
Buffy,"No, but it might kill somebody else."
Xander,"(points at her with his stake) You mean Angel might. (Buffy  turns away) Buffy, this is not the time to challenge Angel for the  ultimate fighting championship. (gestures with his stake) He's at full  strength, you're only half a Slayer."
Buffy,"Yeah, but I'm still the Slayer. And as long as I am, Angel's not  gonna kill anybody else."
Angelus,"(behind her) Aw, c'mon. (she turns to face him) Just one more."
Angelus,"Not feeling well, lover?"
Buffy,That helps.
Angelus,"You know, you being off your game's kinda takin' the fun out  of all this."
Angelus,"Nope, still fun!"
Angelus,Uh-oh. This does *not* look good for our heroine.
Xander,"Take a walk, overbite."
Angelus,We'll have to do this again sometime.
Xander,"Buffy, are you okay?"
Buffy,"(puts her hand to her forehead) I told you guys to leave, I...  (getting dizzy) I... Oh..."
Xander,Buffy!
Willow,Buffy?
Xander,We need help!
Willow,"Somebody, please, now!"
Intern,(approaches them) What happened?
Xander,She fell.
Willow,The flu.
Cordelia,She fainted.
Xander,"The flu, fainted and fell. She's sick, make it better!"
Intern,(pulls the gurney up) It's gonna be okay. Let's get her up.
Intern,Patient's unconscious... Pupils are unequal and unresponsive.
Cordelia,What does that mean?
Willow,Is she gonna be okay?
Intern,"Please, you gotta give us some room."
Intern,"High-grade fever, possible fractures."
Intern,Right.
Xander,Someone should be with her!
Willow,"I'll call Giles, tell him what happened. (to Cordelia) You call  Buffy's mom, tell her, n-not what happened, just get her here."
Joyce,Where is she?
Giles,She's still in the emergency room.
Joyce,I wanna see her. (starts out of the waiting room)
Cordelia,They won't let us in there.
Joyce,(faces her) Yes?
Joyce,Is Buffy okay?
Joyce,(interrupts insistently) Is she okay?
Joyce,(with relief) Thank you. (puts her hand to her face)
Xander,Good. Good. (rubs his hands) That's good.
Joyce,"Buffy? (reaches the bed) Hi, sweetheart."
Xander,"Hey, Buffy, we're all here."
Buffy,(groggy) Hey. Here we are. It's all of we. Are we taking me  home? (tries to get up)
Buffy,(groggy) Yeah? Lie at home. My bed is better than any bed  that's... not my bed.
Buffy,(to Xander) Shhh! (points at him) Hospital zone. No singing.
Buffy,"No! (tries to get up again) Lemme go. Look, I wanna go."
Willow,"Buffy, what's wrong?"
Buffy,No! No! Let me go!
Cordelia,I think she wants to go.
Buffy,"No, don't do that! Stop it!"
Buffy,"(delirious) Giles, tell them!"
Orderly,I got her.
Buffy,The vampires! I need to kill the vampires!
Buffy,Ow! (winces in pain) No!
Xander,It's gotta be the fever.
Willow,"Yeah, it made her delusional."
Buffy,(to Giles insistently) They're out there!
Giles,"(smiling reassuringly) Yes, uh, well, we'll, uh, we'll get  those, uh, vampires later. (laughs lightly, looks at Joyce) I hear it's  best t-to play along. (keeps smiling)"
Joyce,"Honey, listen..."
Buffy,I wanna go home.
Joyce,It's gonna be okay. I promise.
Buffy,Please don't make me stay here...
Joyce,I *promise*.
Xander,That was a new experience. I'm not used to seeing Buffy scared  like that.
Joyce,"Yeah, she just *hates* hospitals. Ever since she was a little  girl."
Willow,What happened?
Joyce,When she was eight her cousin Celia died in a hospital. Buffy  was alone with her at the time.
Cordelia,Yuk!
Joyce,"Yeah, they were very close."
Willow,"Wow, and she was eight?"
Joyce,"(looking in at Buffy) Well, it looks like she's asleep. I should  go call her father. (heads toward the nurse's station)"
Giles,"(accompanies her) Um, I-I think there's a, a phone..."
Joyce,Thank you for coming. I-I *really* appreciate the way you look  out for her.
Giles,Oh...
Joyce,*All* of you.
Giles,"Well, we're, uh, we're very fond of her. (they stop at the  nurse's station) The, uh, the telephone. (starts away)"
Joyce,"I, I... (stops him) I hope I'm not out of line, but... I-I-I  wanted to say how sorry I am about, uh, that teacher, Ms. Calendar.  Buffy said you were close."
Giles,"(nods slightly) Oh, uh... (looks down) Thank you. (looks up)"
Joyce,"(exhales) Buffy's been so down since it happened. I mean, she  never gets sick."
Giles,"(looks down) Well, I'm sure she'll be, uh... (looks up, smiles  reassuringly) She'll be fine."
Joyce,"I'm sorry, I, I babble when I'm nervous, I just wanted to...  Well, if, if you need anything..."
Giles,(nods) Thank you. (quietly) Thank you. (walks off)
Xander,Do you think she's gonna be okay in here?
Cordelia,"(pacing) I don't know, Lysette got her nose done here, and  she came in looking for the Gwyneth Paltrow, and it looked more like the  Mr. Potatohead."
Xander,Cordy...
Willow,Buffy's not here for cosmetic surgery.
Cordelia,"No, but while she's in here, she might as well get that thing  done."
Cordelia,"You know, that thing on her face? (faces them) You know that  thing."
Willow,(to Xander) Do you think Angel will attack Buffy in here?
Xander,"He can come in, it's a public building."
Willow,(worried) That's true.
Cordelia,Am I the only one that's noticed that thing?
Woman,You'll be fine. Is that better?
Orderly,"Man, I hate it when you lose the young ones."
Ryan,He comes at night. The grownups don't see him. He was with Tina.  He'll come back for us.
Buffy,Who?
Ryan,Death.
Xander,Visiting hours are over.
Angelus,"Well, I'm pretty much family."
Xander,"(trying hard to stay cool) Yeah. Why don't you come back during  the day? Oh, gee, no, I guess you can't."
Angelus,"(threateningly) If I decide to walk into Buffy's room, do you  think for one microsecond that you could stop me?"
Xander,Maybe not. Maybe that security guard couldn't either. Or those  cops... or the orderlies... But I'm kinda curious to find out. You game?
Angelus,(pauses) Buffy's White Knight. You still love her. (leans in  close) It must just eat you up that I got there first.
Xander,(fighting his nervousness) You're gonna die. And I'm gonna be  there.
Angelus,Tell her I stopped by.
Celia,"Help me, help! Avalanche! Help! Help! I'm trapped! Avalanche!  Help! Help!"
Celia,"Help me! Help! Help! Please, help!"
Celia,"You saved me! Thank you, Power Girl!"
Buffy,Could've fooled me.
Buffy,"Well, good! Thanks for having me. Let's try and keep in touch.  (tries to get out of bed)"
Buffy,Good 'hmm' or bad 'hmm'?
Buffy,Nope.
Buffy,"Well, then I should probably go, right? (tries to go again)"
Buffy,I-is that the same virus the kids have?
Giles,May we come in?
Xander,(presenting five balloons) Flowers for milady.
Buffy,(looks up at them) I think they call those balloons.
Xander,"(looks up) Yeah, stick 'em in water, maybe they'll grow."
Willow,Not to be outdone... (sets school books on the bed)
Buffy,Homework!
Willow,"It's my way of saying, 'get well soon'."
Buffy,"You know, chocolate says that even better."
Willow,I did all your assignments. All you have to do is sign your  name.
Buffy,Chocolate means *nothing* to me.
Cordelia,Nobody told me I was supposed to bring a gift. (looks at  Giles) I was out of the loop on gifts.
Giles,"It's, it's tradition among, um... people. Um... (walks up to the  bed) Grapes. (sets down the bag) Well, did you, uh, pass the night well  enough?"
Buffy,Not really. Something happened I thought you...
Buffy,You know what? Let's take a walk.
Buffy,"Now, this part I could get used to."
Willow,Do you want me to go real fast? (gets a look from Giles) Not  that I would.
Giles,"We were discussing, um, stuff."
Buffy,"Yes, stuff. Um, you know, a girl died here last night."
Willow,How?
Buffy,"Well, the flu."
Xander,Flu doesn't exactly sound monsterrific.
Buffy,"I know. But there's this Dr. Backer, and he's been giving them  these experimental treatments."
Buffy,"I-I'm not sure what he's up to, but he's a little creepy. A-and  then there was this kid, Ryan. He said he saw something."
Giles,Saw what?
Buffy,Death.
Cordelia,Death?
Willow,"*The* Death? As in, 'it is your time'?"
Giles,"Buffy, a-a-a frightened child..."
Buffy,"Yeah, but I thought I saw something. I'm not sure, I was really  out of it, but..."
Cordelia,But you do know that you saw death.
Willow,Did it have an hourglass?
Xander,"Ooo, if he asks you to play chess, don't even do it. The guy's,  like, a whiz."
Buffy,Maybe it wasn't death. Maybe it was something else.
Cordelia,So this isn't about you being afraid of hospitals 'cause your  friend died and you wanna conjure up a monster that you can fight so you  can save everybody and not feel so helpless?
Giles,"Cordelia, have you actually ever heard of tact?"
Cordelia,Tact is just not saying true stuff. I'll pass.
Willow,Your mom did tell us about your cousin.
Buffy,"This has nothing to do with that. This little boy Ryan is afraid  of something, something real. As long as I'm forced to stay here, I'm  gonna find out what."
Xander,"So, is this the part where we say, what can we do to help?"
Cordelia,"(whispers) You had to ask that, didn't you?"
Xander,"(quietly) Pft! It'll be cake. Just gotta figure out what killed  this little girl Tina, we'll be out. Five minutes tops. (opens a cabinet  door)"
Cordelia,(leans against the wall) This is what happens when you're  compassionate towards sick people. They take advantage of you.
Xander,(gives Cordelia a look) Uh-huh. Buffy almost died just to put  you out.
Cordelia,I didn't wanna be the first one to say it.
Xander,You there. (points to his left) Me here.
Cordelia,Right.
Guard,What are you doing here?
Willow,"So, where do we start?"
Giles,"Hmm? Oh, I don't know. Maybe look into the history of the  hospital, bizarre incidents, that sort of thing."
Willow,I'm sensing a little less than full committal here.
Giles,"Oh, I-I suppose so. Cordelia may be (inhales) homerically  insensitive, but she may also be right. Death and disease are, are  things, possibly the *only* things that, that Buffy cannot fight. It's  only natural for her to try to create a-a defeatable opponent.  Especially now, after... after Jenny."
Willow,"(gives Giles a sad look) That's true. But on the 'we live on  the Hellmouth' side, these kids may have seen a monster."
Giles,"(starts toward the stacks) What, a monster that grown-ups can't  see? Doesn't ring a bell. (pauses) Unless..."
Willow,(sits on the table) Unless?
Giles,"Well, sometimes small children *do* see something we adults  don't: us. Our true selves, our, our... our hidden faces."
Willow,So the kids might be afraid of a regular person? (realizes)  Like the weird doctor!
Giles,"Stanley Backer was his name, no?"
Willow,Let's look him up. (goes to get her laptop)
Guard,"You know, most people think that security guards are just guys  that failed the police exam. But that's not me. This is my career."
Cordelia,Stereotypes are so unfair.
Guard,"I did take the fireman's exam, though. I didn't do so good."
Cordelia,"Oh, well, you know, I think that security guards (plays with  his badge) are *way* sexier than firemen. They're all sooty."
Guard,"Well, this is where all the action is anyhow. I'm all the time  restraining people."
Cordelia,"Mm, how thrilling. (cut to her) Do you ever get scared?"
Guard,"'Fear is for the weak.' That's my motto. Either that, or 'Live  in the now.' I haven't decided yet."
Cordelia,"I bet you see a lot of tragedy. You know, like that little  girl?"
Guard,"Oh, one of Dr. Backer's patients. Dr. Backer's a great man. He  understands..."
Guard,...the real truth about children.
Cordelia,(cut to her) What's that?
Guard,Sometimes they die.
Guard,What was that? (draws his baton)
Cordelia,"Uh, you know, I didn't hear anything. (tries to get his  attention) You know, you have the most... perfect nose I've ever seen."
Cordelia,You must work out.
Guard,(gives her a little growl) Yeah.
Cordelia,(smiles and nods her head) Mm-hm.
Xander,Could you make just a little more with the touchy-gropey?
Cordelia,Jealous?
Xander,"Of Rogaine boy? (chuckles) I don't think so. (hands her the  file) Here, take this to Giles, okay?"
Cordelia,What about you?
Xander,I'm gonna stay here.
Cordelia,"Oh, right. Your obsession with protecting Buffy. Have I told  you how attractive that's not?"
Xander,"Cordelia, someone's gotta watch her back."
Cordelia,"Yeah, well, I've seen you watch her back."
Xander,What is that supposed to mean?
Cordelia,"Well, I was using the phrase 'watch her back' as a euphemism  for 'looking at her butt.' You know, sort of a pun."
Xander,Oh! Right. (gets the insult) Hey!
Cordelia,"Well, you do."
Xander,Jealous?
Cordelia,Fine. Watch *my* back.
Buffy,Hey. Remember me?
Ryan,You shouldn't be here.
Buffy,Why not?
Ryan,Contagious.
Buffy,Nah. I already got what you got.
Buffy,"Oh, what, you think because I'm a grown-up? Believe me, I'm not  that grown up."
Ryan,He'll come again tonight.
Buffy,"Ryan, listen to me. (he looks at her) I'm not gonna let this  thing hurt you. Any of you. Grown-ups don't believe you, right? Well, I  do. We both know that there are real monsters. But there's also real  heroes that fight monsters. And that's me."
Ryan,Can't fight death.
Giles,Our Dr. Backer has something of a rap sheet.
Willow,"Reprimands for controversial experiments, risky procedures, a  malpractice suit. Looks like it was dropped suddenly."
Giles,"(takes off his glasses) Factor in Buffy's observation that he  gives her the, um, uh, wiggins... (turns away and thinks)"
Willow,This may be our death guy?
Giles,(turns back to her) I just wish I knew what he was doing to  these children.
Giles,"Uh, well, it looks as if you, uh, were on to something."
Buffy,I know.
Giles,"(walks around the bed) The, uh, the, the girl Tina, um, it's  apparent that she, she died of the fever, (sits) simple enough, but, but  her records show her improving and then suddenly deteriorating w-w-w- without any apparent cause."
Willow,So we checked Dr. Backer out. This guy was *not* a solid  citizen.
Buffy,It wasn't Backer. He was clean.
Cordelia,What do you mean 'clean'?
Xander,What do you mean 'was'?
Buffy,"He's dead. This thing killed him, and not with kindness. (hands  Giles the picture)"
Willow,You saw it?
Buffy,"No, it's invisible. I saw Backer nearly shredded and the thing  knocked me down. But it's real. Which means I get to fight it."
Giles,"Um, (takes off his glasses) this is your work? (indicates the  picture)"
Buffy,"No, one of the kids."
Giles,"Oh. Um... Well, it would help if-if we knew what it was.  (exhales) I-it's invisible to you, but the, the children can see it."
Cordelia,But you said you did see something the other night.
Buffy,"Uh, yeah, but I was pretty delirious. I mean, it doesn't make  any sense. Why would I see it then and not last night?"
Joyce,Good morning.
Joyce,"Ooo, looks like I interrupted a secret meeting."
Cordelia,(smiling widely) You sure didn't!
Joyce,"Honey, I, I just talked to the doctor, and she said I can take  you home."
Buffy,(considers a moment) No. I should stay here.
Joyce,"(confused) But, honey, I thought you'd be raring..."
Buffy,I think my symptoms are flaring up.
Willow,She doesn't look well.
Buffy,"'Cause I'm not well. Uh, I feel all oogy."
Xander,Increased ooginess. That's a danger signal.
Joyce,Are you sure?
Buffy,"Oh, yeah, but just for a day... or s-so."
Joyce,"Okay, well, I'll, uh, I'll talk to the doctor."
Xander,So what's the drill?
Buffy,"Giles, see if you can get a mug shot on that guy. I need to know  what I'm fighting."
Giles,Right. Yes. (walks around the bed)
Buffy,I'll check Backer's office. See if I can find any post-its  marked 'why a monster might want me dead.'
Xander,Sounds like a plan.
Buffy,"Course, if I find anything, I won't know what it means, so,  Will..."
Willow,"Oh, yeah, I'm good at medical stuff since Xander and I used to  play doctor all the time."
Xander,"(chuckles) No, she's being literal. (gets a look from Cordelia)  She used to have all these medical volumes, uh, and diagnosed me with  stuff. I didn't have the heart to tell her she was playing it wrong."
Willow,(to Xander) Wrong? Why? (to Buffy) How did *you* play doctor?
Buffy,(evasively) I never have.
Giles,"Um, fascinating though this is..."
Buffy,"Yeah, right. Go!"
Giles,W-w-we'll call you if we... know something.
Buffy,Know something soon.
Giles,I'd best head for the library. Research beckons.
Xander,"I'm on sentry duty. Angel won't show till sundown if at all,  but maybe I'll get lucky with this death guy."
Cordelia,He's invisible.
Xander,"Yeah, but if I see a floating pipe and a smoking jacket, he's  dropped."
Giles,"Well, you two, stay alert."
Xander,"Finding out who this thing is takes priority. Cordy, you should  go with Giles."
Giles,"Why do I have to have... (looks at Cordelia) Uh, good thinking.  I-I-I could do with a research assistant."
Cordelia,"(to Giles) Let's go, tact-guy."
Giles,Yes. (goes to the elevator)
Cordelia,(to Xander) Be careful. (follows Giles)
Willow,"It's weird going through his things. (Buffy opens the fridge)  Look, he didn't finish his coffee. Guess he won't. (looks at the  printouts)"
Buffy,"(closes the fridge) Yep, another person I wasn't in time to  save. (comes to the desk) It's too bad Angel didn't put me in the  hospital sooner. There's something I never thought I'd hear myself say."
Willow,"Hey, wait, I think I have something."
Buffy,Hmm. Sherlock.
Willow,"Okay, this makes sense. Dr. Backer was trying to inoculate the  kids with a controlled dosage of the same virus they already had. (gets  a confused look from Buffy) Oh, raising their temperatures to burn the  fever out of them."
Buffy,Would that work?
Willow,According to this it was starting to. So he really was trying  to help the kids.
Buffy,Till that thing stopped him.
Cordelia,"Eww, what does this do?"
Giles,(puts his mug down) What?
Cordelia,What does this do? (pushes the book toward him)
Giles,"Uh, it, uh, extracts vital organs to replenish its own mutating  cells."
Cordelia,Wow! (leans over to look at his book) What does this one do?  (points to a drawing)
Giles,"(looks up at her) Um, i-it elongates its mouth to, uh, engulf  its victim's head with its incisors."
Cordelia,"Ouch. Wait, what does this one do? (points to another)"
Giles,(frustrated) It asks endless questions of those with whom it's  supposed to be working so that nothing is getting done.
Cordelia,"Boy, there's a demon for everything."
Giles,"I don't even know if we're on the right track. Since this, uh...  miscreant has only been seen by select individuals, there's a chance we  won't ever... find a picture of it."
Cordelia,"Well, it's not in here."
Cordelia,It's called Der Kindestod.
Buffy,(cut to her on her bed) Who is this?
Cordelia,(cut to her) It's me. I've got your monster!
Buffy,(cut to her) Where's Giles?
Cordelia,(cut to her) Looking up stuff.
Buffy,"(cut to her) Well, can you put him on?"
Cordelia,"(cut to her) Hey! (closes the book and heads for the desk) I  found your guy, (cut to Buffy) okay? Just listen."
Buffy,Right.
Cordelia,"(cut to her at Giles' desk) The name means 'child death'.  (cut to Buffy listening intently) This book says that he feeds off of  children by sucking the life out of them. (cut to her) Eew! But anyway,  afterwards, it looks like they died because they were sick."
Buffy,(cut to her) So it did kill Tina.
Cordelia,"Yeah, that's my take. (cut to her) 'Cause it would be looking  at the children's ward as basically an all-you-can-eat kind of thing,  y'know."
Buffy,"(cut to her) Backer was curing the kids and taking away the (cut  to Cordelia, nodding) Kindestod's food."
Cordelia,"Hence, the slice-age."
Giles,(comes into his office) I found a picture of how it kills. Let  me talk to her.
Cordelia,(takes the book and looks) Oh! Eww!
Buffy,(cut to her) What?
Cordelia,"(cut to her) Oh! (cut to Willow, looking concerned) Uh, you  should see this thing! The way it does its thing, (cut to her) I mean,  eww! (hands the phone to Giles and gets up) Why do I let you guys drag  me into this stuff? (leaves)"
Giles,"(into the phone) Uh, uh, Buffy? (cut to Buffy) Are you, are you  still there?"
Buffy,Hanging on every (cut to Giles) eww.
Giles,"(sits) Uh, the, um, the Kindestod gorges by sitting atop his  prey, (cut to Buffy listening closely) pinning it down, uh, helplessly.  Then he slowly draws out the life. I-it must be, uh, h-horrifying for  the victim."
Giles,Buffy? Hello?
Celia,Get it off of me! (screams)
Celia,Get it off of me! (screams)
Giles,"(cut to him) Buffy, w-what is it?"
Willow,(cut to her) (takes the phone) Thanks. (hangs up)
Buffy,It killed Celia.
Willow,Your cousin?
Buffy,"(looks at Willow) We have to get this thing, Willow, before it  gets any more kids."
Willow,You will. We will.
Buffy,But how? I-I can't even see it.
Willow,You saw it once.
Buffy,"Did I? Uh, maybe my mind was playing tricks on me. I mean, I was  crazed with that fever. Who knows..."
Willow,"Buffy, think about this."
Buffy,I have. Lots of thoughts. (crouches down)
Willow,It's crazy.
Buffy,(searches the test-tubes) The fever. That's how you see the  Kindestod. That's why Celia could see it. That's why Ryan still can.  (finds the right one) It's the only way.
Willow,But how are you gonna fight this thing with 107 degree  temperature? (42d C)
Buffy,I guess we'll find out.
Willow,Buffy!
Buffy,"Willow, I'm going to do this."
Willow,"Buffy, that's 100% pure. It'll kill you in an instant."
Buffy,Oh. They really should put that on the label.
Willow,It needs to be diluted.
Buffy,"Okay, but this better work fast."
Buffy,Faster than that.
Buffy,Here's to my health.
Buffy,"Oh, God. I'm not sure this was such a good idea."
Willow,Hang in there. You'll be okay.
Buffy,Okay. I'm okay.
Buffy,The kids. They're gone.
Ryan,Come on!
Girl,Hold me!
Ryan,Keep quiet!
Willow,What could have happened?
Buffy,I don't know. (faces her) Maybe we're too late. Maybe they  moved. (feels her forehead) Maybe I don't... I'm burning up!
Buffy,Will?
Willow,What?
Buffy,I think it's in there.
Buffy,It's going after them! (turns to Willow) We gotta get 'em.
Buffy,"(to Willow) Okay, we'll get 'em in a second."
Willow,"I, uh, she's not feeling well again."
Buffy,"No, no, it's not that bad."
Buffy,No!
Willow,(back to the doctor) She's sorry!
Guard,"Okay, come on now. (holds his baton threateningly) We can do  this the easy way."
Willow,(frantically) Frogs! Frogs! Get 'em off of me!
Willow,"Oh, my God, frogs! Get them off of me! Please, help!"
Willow,"Get 'em off! FROGS! Frogs! Oh, my God, horrible frogs!"
Willow,(squeals) Get 'em...
Willow,"(looks up, calm again) No more frogs!"
Guard,C'mon!
Xander,"Buffy, are you okay? Did Angel..."
Buffy,(shakes her head) No. We need to get to the basement.
Ryan,Shh!
Girl,I'm cold.
Ryan,Here.
Ryan,Here. We're gonna be safe in here.
Boy,Look!
Ryan,What?
Ryan,Whoa!
Xander,You don't know how to kill this thing.
Buffy,I thought I might try violence.
Xander,Solid call.
Ryan,Oof!
Buffy,You make me sick.
Xander,Up.
Xander,"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Hurry!"
Xander,(concerned) Are you okay?
Buffy,"Actually, (looks up at him) I think I'm starting to feel better.  Let's..."
Buffy,Oh!
Xander,"He's dead right? I mean, I heard something snap."
Buffy,That would be his neck.
Xander,"You're not gonna yak on me, are ya?"
Joyce,"Here you go, honey. Peanut butter and jelly, without the crust,  just the way you like it."
Buffy,And the juice?
Joyce,"(hands Buffy the plate) Two parts orange, one part grapefruit."
Buffy,That's my drink.
Joyce,I measured it exactly. (gets up to go)
Buffy,"(looks at the sandwich) Oh, mom?"
Joyce,Mm-hm?
Buffy,I wanted crunchy peanut butter.
Joyce,"Oh, sorry. (comes back)"
Buffy,A-and I said extra jelly. (hands up the plate)
Joyce,(smiles) Anything to help my daughter get well. (starts to go  again)
Willow,"Oh, and while you're up, could I get a refill? (holds out her  glass) It's just I'm so comfortable."
Joyce,(steps over) Of course. (takes the glass)
Willow,Thanks.
Xander,"Oh, oh, oh, (holds up an empty bag) and another bag of cheesy  chips. (tosses the bag away)"
Joyce,"(raises her eyebrows at him) Uh, you ate the last one."
Xander,"No, there's another bag hidden behind the raisins."
Joyce,(sighs) I'm on it. (leaves)
Xander,(to Buffy) Your mom's tryin' to Bogart the cheesy chips. What's  that all about?
Joyce,"Oh, Buffy, here. Um, this came in the mail. (hands it to Buffy)"
Buffy,(reads the return address and smiles) It's from Ryan. (opens it)
Joyce,The boy from the hospital?
Joyce,"(smiles) Oh, he drew you a picture."
Joyce,How... nice.
