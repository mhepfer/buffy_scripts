character,dialogue
Snyder,"A lot of educators tell students, 'Think of your principal as  your pal.'"
Snyder,"I say, 'Think of me as your judge, jury, and executioner.' Tell  me, who do you think is the most troublesome student in this school?"
Snyder,"Well, it is quite a match between you two. On the one hand,  Buffy hasn't stabbed a horticulture teacher with a trowel."
Sheila,I didn't stab anyone with a trowel. They were pruning shears.
Snyder,"On the other hand, Sheila has never burned down a school  building."
Buffy,"W-well, that was never proven. The Fire Marshall said i-it  coulda been mice."
Snyder,Mice.
Buffy,M-mice that were smoking?
Snyder,The two of you seem to be tied in the class-cutting and fight- starting events. You really are neck and neck here. It's quite exciting.
Sheila,What does the winner get?
Snyder,"Expelled. (Buffy looks at him in shock) Thursday is Parent- Teacher night. Your parents, assuming you have any, will meet your  teachers, assuming you have any left. I've decided to put the two of you  in charge of this event. You have three days to prepare the  refreshments, make the banners and transform the school lounge into a  habitable place for adults. This will incur my good will. And may affect  what I tell your parents when I meet them. Are we clear?"
Buffy,I'm clear. (to Sheila) Don't you feel clear? (Sheila just looks  back) We're very clear.
Snyder,"Good. Because you mess up this time, and your parents will be  coming to clean out your lockers."
Buffy,"Well, it shouldn't be that hard. We can work on the banners at  lunch tomorrow and figure out refreshments then?"
Sheila,"Yeah, sure, whatever. (yells) Hey, meatpie! (walks off)"
Xander,"Snyder's got you guys making party favors, huh?"
Buffy,His two worst students. That's what mom sees when she looks at  me. A Sheila.
Xander,"Well, Sheila's definitely intense. That guy with her? That's  the guy she *can* bring home to mother."
Willow,She was already smoking in fifth grade. Once I was lookout for  her.
Xander,(to Willow) You're bad to the bone.
Willow,I'm a rebel.
Buffy,It's not fair. I'm the Slayer. That requires a certain amount of  cutting and fighting. What's Sheila's excuse?
Xander,"Homework. She won't do it. And most teachers respect that now.  Oh, you might wanna keep away any sharp implements when you're working  with her."
Buffy,Do you think any other Slayers ever had to go to high school?
Xander,"It's no biggie. You'll have a nice soire'e. The parents will  love it. As long as nothing really bad happens between now and then,  you'll be fine."
Buffy,Are you crazy? What did you say that for? Now something bad is  gonna happen!
Xander,Whadaya mean? Nothing's gonna happen.
Willow,"Not until some dummy says, 'as long as nothing bad happens.'"
Buffy,It's the ultimate jinx!
Willow,What were you thinking? Or were you even thinking at all?
Xander,"Well, you guys don't know. (hugs his satchel) Maybe this time  it'll be different."
Spike,"Home, sweet home."
Collin,Can you do it?
Spike,"(appears behind them) *You* were *there*? (chuckles) Oh, please!  If every vampire who said he was at the crucifixion was actually there,  it would have been like Woodstock."
Spike,"(turns his back to him and strolls away) I was actually at  Woodstock. That was a weird gig. I fed off a flowerperson, and I spent  the next six hours watchin' my hand move."
Spike,So. Who do you kill for fun around here?
Collin,Who are you?
Spike,Spike. You're that Anointed guy. I read about you. (growls at  vampire#2) You've got Slayer problems. That's a bad piece of luck. Do  you know what I find works real good with Slayers? Killing them.
Collin,Can you?
Spike,"A lot faster than Nancy-boy there. Yeah, I did a couple Slayers  in my time. I don't like to brag. (can't keep a straight face) Who am I  kidding? I *love* to brag! There was this one Slayer during the Boxer  Rebellion, and..."
Spike,Drusilla. (goes to her) You shouldn't be walking around. You're  weak.
Drusilla,Look at all the people. Are these nice people?
Spike,We're getting along.
Drusilla,(stares at Collin) This one has power. I could feel it from  the outside.
Spike,"Yeah. He's the big noise in these parts. Anointed, and all that."
Drusilla,"(to Collin) Do you like daisies? Hmm? I plant them, but they  always die. Everything I put in the ground withers and dies. (looks up  and off into space) Spike? I'm cold."
Spike,(puts his jacket around her) I've got you.
Drusilla,I'm a princess.
Spike,That's what you are.
Spike,"Me and Dru, we're movin' in. (they separate) Now. Any of you  want to test who's got the biggest wrinklies 'round here... step on up.  (to Collin) I'll do your Slayer for you. But you keep your flunkies from  tryin' anything behind my back. Deal?"
Drusilla,"I can't see her. The Slayer. I can't see. (looks back up)  It's dark where she is. Kill her. Kill her, Spike. Kill her for me?"
Spike,"It's done, baby."
Drusilla,Kill her for princess?
Spike,I'll chop her into messes.
Drusilla,You are my sweet... my little Spike.
Spike,(to Collin) So. How 'bout this Slayer? Is she tough?
Buffy,Ow!
Joyce,What's wrong?
Buffy,"I spent a good part of my allowance on this new cream rinse, and  it's neither creamy nor rinsey."
Joyce,"Life is hard, dear."
Buffy,Don't I know it. Is that a split end?
Joyce,I got the mail.
Buffy,Good.
Joyce,Which included a reminder notice about Parent-Teacher night.  Thursday.
Buffy,That's good.
Joyce,Which you were planning on telling me about?
Buffy,"Oh, for... (faces her mom) the last two weeks."
Joyce,"Uh-huh. So, what do you think your teachers are gonna tell me  about?"
Buffy,"Well, I think they'll all agree that I always bring a pen to  class, ready to absorb the knowledge. (sits on her bed)"
Joyce,"And, uh, this absorption rate? How is it reflected in your  homework and test scores?"
Buffy,What can you really tell about a person from a test score?
Joyce,Whether or not she's ever going out with her friends again.
Buffy,"Oh, that."
Joyce,"Well, I look forward to meeting your principal."
Buffy,Won't that be something.
Joyce,"(comes over to the bed) Look, sweetheart. Life is more than  grades and homework and not getting kicked out of school. (sits next to  Buffy)"
Buffy,I know.
Joyce,"But we moved once because of you getting in trouble. And I had  to start a new business, not to mention a new life in a whole new town."
Buffy,And you don't wanna do it again.
Joyce,What I don't want is to be disappointed in you again.
Buffy,"Mom, that's the last thing that I want, too. (exhales) I'm  trying, I really am. I just... I have a lot of pressure on me right now."
Joyce,Wait till you get a job. Sleep tight. (gets up and leaves)
Buffy,I have a job.
Willow,Sheila's a no-show? She goes to this really rank bar. The Fish  Tank? Sometimes they have raids and other stuff that can make you tardy.
Buffy,D'you think you can help me cram some French tonight? I don't  want Mr. DeJean telling my mother I'm an imbecile.
Willow,I thought we were going to the Bronze tonight. 'Cause of how  you thought Angel might show?
Xander,If he does he'll meet some other nice girl? Studying comes  first.
Buffy,We're going to the Bronze. I can study and party and do Parent- Teacher night and make my mother proud as long as I don't have to...
Giles,Buffy!
Buffy,...fight vampires.
Giles,(to Jenny) There is nothing in the chronicles about a-an  extraneous lunar cycle.
Jenny,"The Order never accurately calculated the Mesopotamian Calendar.  Rupert, you have *got* to read something that was published after 1066."
Giles,Very funny.
Xander,"What's the up, guys?"
Giles,"W-um, Ms. Calendar has been researching, well, uh, surfing on  her computer, a-and she's... Well, according to her calculations, this  Saturday is the night of St. Vigeous."
Buffy,Let me guess: he didn't make balloon animals.
Giles,"No, he led a crusade, of, of, uh, vampires. They swept through  Edessa, Harran, and points east."
Jenny,And they didn't leave much behind.
Buffy,"Well, if I survive Parent-Teacher night tomorrow, I'll see what  I can do about Saturday."
Giles,"You're being a tad flip, don't you think? This is serious."
Buffy,And getting kicked out of school is laughs aplenty?
Giles,"You know what happens when you, you let your life interfere with  your slaying."
Buffy,"Okay, well, if my slaying doesn't get me expelled, then I  promise my banner making won't get me killed, okay? Just please let me  get through this week."
Giles,This Saturday's going to need a great deal of preparation.
Willow,"Well, we'll help."
Xander,"Yeah, I'll whittle stakes."
Willow,A-and I can research stuff.
Xander,"And while I'm whittling, I plan to whistle a jaunty tune."
Giles,"Yes, your help will be greatly appreciated, but when it comes to  battle, Buffy must fight alone. You are, after all, the Slay... (sees  Snyder in the hall) ...slay-ve. Slaves. You're, you're all slaves to  the, uh, television."
Jenny,Yes.
Giles,Young people nowadays. (to Jenny) Shall we go?
Jenny,"Mm, let's. (they leave)"
Snyder,"(to Willow and Xander) You wouldn't be helping Buffy in  Sheila's place, would you?"
Xander,(laughs nervously) No.
Willow,We're hindering.
Snyder,She ditched. (takes a deep breath) Mm. I feel an expulsion  coming on.
Buffy,"No. No, actually, Sheila's been helping us for hours. Um, she  just went to get some more paint."
Buffy,"Oh! Oh, is there no more teal in the art room? (goes over to  Sheila) I know you wanted everything to be perfect, but let's just go  with what we have."
Snyder,Just make sure everything is perfect on Thursday. (turns and  leaves)
Sheila,Thanks for covering. Guy's a serious rodent.
Buffy,No problem.
Sheila,Did you really burn down a school building one time?
Buffy,"Well, not actually one time."
Sheila,Cool.
Lyrics,<I>A drink you can't resist / And in your head a voice you'll  always miss</I>
Buffy,La vache... doit me... touche... de la... jeudi. (looks at  Willow) Was it wrong? Should I use the plural?
Willow,"No. But you said, 'The cow should touch me from Thursday.'"
Buffy,Maybe that's what I was feeling.
Willow,And you said it wrong.
Buffy,"Oh, je stink."
Willow,You're just not focused. It's Angel missage.
Buffy,"Well, he didn't say for sure. It was a 'maybe see ya there'  kinda deal."
Xander,"Guys, I'm all alone out there. Somebody has to dance with me."
Willow,"Well, we are studying."
Xander,"C'mon, one dance. You've been studying nearly twelve minutes."
Buffy,No wonder my brain's fried.
Buffy,Come on.
Lyrics,"<I>I did a stupid thing last night / I called you / A moment of  weakness / No, not a moment / More like three months of weakness</I>"
Lyrics,<I>I'm one step away from crashing to my knees / One step away  from spilling my guts to you</I>
Spike,Go get something to eat.
Lyrics,"<I>I'm doing all right / No, don't feel sorry for me / Really I'm  all right / I'm one step away from crashing to my knees</I>"
Spike,Where's the phone? I need to call the police. There's some big  guy out there trying to bite somebody.
Buffy,Slayee!
Buffy,Get her out of here!
Buffy,(to the rhythm of her punches) And a *stake* would be *nice*!
Xander,Buffy!
Spike,"Nice work, love."
Buffy,Who are you?
Spike,You'll find out on Saturday.
Buffy,What happens on Saturday?
Spike,I kill you.
Sheila,"Alright. Which one's Dwayne and which one's Dell? (hic) Don't  tell me. Dell's the one with the tattoos. You guys weren't lyin' about  havin' a Cadillac, were you? 'Cause I'm crazy about a Cad. Just the feel  of the leather makes me wanna..."
Sheila,Where'd you go?
Sheila,"What's going on? (starts walking slowly, looking around) Where  are you guys? Not funny!"
Sheila,Who are you?
Spike,Who do you want me to be?
Sheila,Did you see...
Spike,...those two losers who thought they were good enough for you?
Sheila,What happened to 'em?
Spike,They got sleepy.
Sheila,Huh?
Spike,And you got something a whole lot better.
Sheila,"Hey, wait up! What's your name?"
Giles,"Spike. That's what the other vampire called him? That's a little  unorthodox, isn't it?"
Buffy,Maybe he's reformed.
Giles,Perhaps he went by another name in... times past.
Jenny,"Well, whoever he is, we'll need all the help we can get come  this Saturday."
Xander,"So, this night of St. Vigeous deal. If they're gonna attack in  force, aren't we thinkin' vacation?"
Willow,"We can't run, that would be wrong. Could we hide? I mean, if  that Spike guy is leading the attack, (shudders) yeeehehehe."
Giles,"Well, he can't be any worse than any other creature you've  faced."
Angel,(suddenly appears) He's worse. (they all look at him) Once he  starts something he doesn't stop until everything in his path is dead.
Xander,"Hmm. So, he's thorough, goal-oriented."
Buffy,We were at the Bronze before. Thought you said you might show.
Angel,You said you weren't sure if you were going.
Buffy,"I was being cool. C'mon, you've been dating for, what, like, two  hundred years? You don't know what a girl means when she says maybe  she'll show?"
Willow,"Wow, two centuries of dating. If you only had two a year,  that's still, like, four hundred (Buffy gives her a look) dates with  four hundred different... (looks at the mace on the table) Why do they  call it a mace?"
Giles,"Uh, we do have slightly more urgent matters to discuss."
Buffy,"Yeah, like keeping my mom away from Principal Snyder tomorrow  night?"
Jenny,And not dying Saturday.
Giles,"Angel, do you know if this Spike fellow goes under any other  name?"
Xander,"Okay, that's it. I'm puttin' a collar with a little bell on  that guy."
Drusilla,"Miss Edith speaks out of turn. She's a bad example, and will  have no cakes today. Shhhh."
Spike,"(comes up behind her) Darling, are you going to eat something?"
Drusilla,I'm not hungry. I miss Prague.
Spike,"You nearly died in Prague. Idiot mob. This is the place for us.  (leads her to the bed) The Hellmouth will restore you, put color in your  cheeks, metaphorically speaking, and in a few week's time..."
Drusilla,"(lies back on the bed) The stars will align, and smile down  on us."
Spike,"(leans over her) And then, God, this town will burn."
Drusilla,(giggles) A pretty fire!
Drusilla,(hears the chanting) They're preparing.
Spike,St. Vigeous is coming up. Should be a party.
Drusilla,You should go up with them and cleanse.
Spike,Dru...
Drusilla,The boy doesn't trust you. They follow him. (sits up) I think  sometimes that all my hair will fall out and I'll be bald.
Spike,"(sits up) Never happen. Alright. (gets off of the bed) I'll go  up and get chanty with the fellas, but *you* (goes to Sheila) got to do  me one favor. (takes Sheila off of the hook) Eat something. (hands  Sheila to Drusilla and leaves)"
Drusilla,"(turns Sheila to the dolls) You see, Miss Edith? (cut to the  doll facing away) If you'd been good you could (cut to Drusilla in her  game face) watch with the rest."
Giles,"For three nights the unholy ones scourge themselves into a fury,  um, culminating in a savage attack on the night of St. Vigeous."
Xander,Does anybody remember when Saturday night meant date night?
Cordelia,You sure don't.
Buffy,"Ooo! Parents start arriving in an hour. Okay, so, um, banners  are in place, the lounge is comfy... What am I forgetting?"
Willow,Punch?
Buffy,"Punch. I need, I need punch!"
Cordelia,My fingers are cramping. How long have I been doing this?
Xander,Three minutes.
Cordelia,"So, can I go now? She doesn't need this many stakes. I mean,  if this guy Spike is as mean as you all said, it should be over pretty  quickly. (Buffy looks up at her) We're still all rooting for you on  Saturday. I'd be there for you myself if I didn't have a leg wax."
Buffy,You guys hold down the fort. I'm punch bound.
Buffy,No!
Willow,What kinda punch did you make?
Buffy,"Uh, lemonade. (hands her a cup) I made it fresh and everything."
Willow,How much sugar did you use? (takes a sip)
Buffy,Sugar?
Willow,It's very good.
Buffy,"Okay, now all I have to do is keep my mother and Snyder from  crossing paths for the rest of the night."
Willow,"(sees Joyce) Hi, Mrs. Summers."
Joyce,"Hi, Willow. Hi, honey. Did you, uh, do all this?"
Buffy,"Yeah! Um, (picks up a cup) here, have some lemonade. (sees  Snyder) Right after Willow shows you the library. I have to stay here  and hostess. (puts the cup back down)"
Willow,"Great, the library. (puts her arm around Joyce's shoulder) Uh,  um, ooo, no, G-Giles and everyone..."
Buffy,...is locked in there studying. Right. French class it is!
Snyder,Was that your mother?
Buffy,"Here. (fakes a spill) Oh! Oh, sorry! Um, yeah! Yeah, I was gonna  introduce you, but, um, she wouldn't have said much. Y'know, she doesn't  speak a word of English."
Cordelia,Giles has us locked up in that library working on *your*  weapons. Even slaves get minimum wage.
Buffy,What?
Cordelia,"You're starting to look a little slagged. What, are you just  skipping foundation entirely now?"
Buffy,"Cordelia, I have at least three lives to contend with, none of  which really mesh. It's kind of like oil and water and a... third  unmeshable thing."
Cordelia,"Yeah, and I can see the oil. (sees Joyce talking to Willow)  Is that your mom? (Buffy looks) Now that is a woman that knows how to  moisturize. Did it, like, skip a generation?"
Joyce,"(comes over) Well, I believe that I have seen every classroom on  campus, and just as I get there all your teachers miraculously have  stepped out."
Buffy,"Oh! (notices Snyder coming back into the room) Oh. Um, but you  haven't seen the boiler room yet. And, you know, that's really  interesting, what with the boiler being in the room and all. (laughs  nervously)"
Joyce,Hi. I'm Joyce Summers. I'm Buffy's mother.
Snyder,(ignores her hand) Principal Snyder. I'm afraid we need to  talk. My office is down here.
Buffy,(worried) He didn't look very happy.
Willow,But you did such a good job.
Cordelia,When they're done talking...
Buffy,What?
Cordelia,"My guess? Tenth high school reunion, you'll still be  grounded."
Willow,"Cordelia, have some lemonade."
Giles,"Oh, there you are."
Jenny,There who is?
Giles,"Our new friend Spike. He's known as 'William the Bloody'. Earned  his nickname by torturing his victims with railroad spikes. Very  pleasant. Well, here's some good news: he's barely two hundred. He's not  even as old as Angel is. (frowns) Oh."
Xander,"That's a bad look, right?"
Giles,"I think your suggestion of running away this Saturday might've  been a good one. Spike has fought two Slayers in the last century,  and... he's killed them both."
Joyce,"In the car, now."
Spike,What can I say? I couldn't wait.
Spike,Nobody gets out! Especially the girl!
Buffy,"Everybody, this way! C'mon! C'mon!"
Willow,Hey!
Giles,What the hell...?!
Buffy,Spike and an army! Look out!
Giles,Back!
Buffy,In here! Now!
Spike,And the Slayer?
Spike,You don't know?! (lets go of the man) I'm a veal kind of guy.  You're too old to eat. (grabs his head and snaps his neck) But not to  kill. (looks at vampire#2) I feel better.
Giles,They've cut the phones. (has an idea) Wait a minute. There's an  old boarded up-cellar behind the stacks. You can get out that way. (to  Xander) Find Angel. He knows about Spike. We need him.
Xander,"No, I'm not going anywhere until I know that Buffy and Willow  are alright."
Giles,No one will be alright unless we get some help!
Man,"Who are those people, and what do they want?"
Joyce,"I didn't get much of a look, but is there something wrong with  their faces? I..."
Snyder,Yes! PCP! It's a gang on PCP! We've gotta get out of here.
Buffy,You can't go outside! They'll kill you!
Snyder,You don't tell me! I tell you!
Buffy,"(pulls him down) They will kill everybody in this room. Nobody  goes out, nobody comes in until *I* say so. Do you hear me?"
Snyder,Who do you think you are?
Buffy,I'm the one that knows how to stop them.
Joyce,"Buffy, are you crazy? Look, I know you've been accused of  fighting and other things, but those guys are serious. You can't go out  there."
Buffy,I know. That's why I'm going up there.
Buffy,"Don't worry, Mom."
Spike,"Slaaayer! Here, kitty, kittyyy. I find one of your friends  first, I'm gonna suck 'em dry. And use their bones to bash your head in.  (kicks a door open)"
Spike,Are you getting a word picture here?
Cordelia,"(whispers) Oh, God, oh, God!"
Spike,(sing-song) Someone's in the ceeeeeiling!
Jenny,Hey-hey-hey-hey! What are you doing?
Jenny,There are at least three vampires in that hall! God only knows  how many others in the building!
Giles,"(looks at Jenny) Listen! I am the Watcher! I am responsible for  her, and I have, I have to go!"
Jenny,Rupert!
Jenny,Be careful.
Giles,Push these back as soon as I...
Giles,Buffy! (lowers the ax) You're all right!
Jenny,How are the others?
Buffy,"Principal Snyder, my mother and four others are locked in the  science room across the hall. Willow and Cordelia ran the other way.  (puts on Xander's bag) I don't know if they're... Where's Xander?"
Giles,He got out through the stacks. He's getting Angel.
Buffy,"Good. Okay, I'm gonna take the vamps out in the hall. After that  you get my mother and the others out the same way."
Giles,Let me help you.
Buffy,"Giles, my mother's in that room. If I don't make it out of here,  I know you'll make sure she does."
Giles,"Bloody right, I will. Fair enough. What's your plan?"
Buffy,"Well, they split up to hold us here, so I'm gonna take 'em one  on one. Set 'em up and knock 'em down."
Giles,Watch your back!
Joyce,Why don't you sit down?
Snyder,"This is my school. What I say goes, and I say this is *not*  happening."
Joyce,"Well, then I guess the danger's over!"
Man,I'm not waiting for them to open the doors. I'm gettin' out!
Joyce,Don't be an idiot!
Snyder,I'm beginning to see a certain mother-daughter resemblance.
Joyce,"No! Look, you heard what Buffy said!"
Snyder,She's a student. What does she know?
Vampire,Yeah. Door's solid.
Spike,Use your head.
Spike,You! Come with me!
Snyder,(grunts) I did it!
Xander,"You know a lot about this Spike guy, so, um... you got a plan?"
Xander,Good plan.
Cordelia,(whispers) I think he's gone. (reaches for the door)
Willow,(whispers) He could come back!
Cordelia,(looks at Willow) What are we gonna do?
Willow,Pray.
Vampire,Hey! Guard the door! I'm almost finished!
Joyce,Buffy! Are you okay?
Buffy,"I'm fine, mom."
Joyce,"Buffy, look, uh, get out of here, okay? We'll be alright!"
Buffy,"Look, just hang on for one more minute until I tell you to open  the door."
Buffy,Sheila! Where've you been?
Sheila,Sorry I'm late. There's some really weird guys outside.
Buffy,"Shh! Yeah, I know. They're trying to kill us."
Sheila,(picks up the ax and smiles) This should be fun.
Spike,Angelus!
Angel,Spike!
Spike,I'll be damned!
Angel,"I taught you to always guard your perimeter. Tsk, tsk, tsk. You  should have someone out there."
Spike,I did. I'm surrounded by idiots. What's new with you?
Angel,Everything.
Spike,Yeah. Come up against this Slayer yet?
Angel,"She's cute. Not too bright, though. Gave the puppy dog 'I'm all  tortured' act. Keeps her off my back when I feed! (laughs)"
Spike,(laughing) People still fall for that Anne Rice routine. What a  world!
Xander,I knew you were lying.
Xander,Undead liar guy.
Angel,Wanna bite before we kill her?
Buffy,(whispers) Stay behind me.
Giles,Buffy! Look out!
Buffy,"Mom, now!"
Joyce,"(opens the door) Okay, come on, let's go!"
Joyce,C'mon! Hurry!
Buffy,(to Giles) Get them out!
Joyce,You're coming too!
Buffy,In a minute! Go! (rushes off)
Joyce,(watching her go) Buffy!
Spike,I haven't seen you in the killing fields for an age.
Angel,I'm not much for company.
Spike,"No, you never were. So, why're you so scared of this Slayer?"
Angel,Scared?
Spike,"Yeah. Time was you would've taken her out in a heartbeat. Now  look at you. I bet this, uh, tortured thing is an act, right? You're  not... housebroken?"
Angel,"I saw her kill the Master. Hey, you think you can take her  alone? Be my guest. I'll just feed and run. (roars and bends to Xander's  neck)"
Spike,(holds up his hand) Don't be silly! We're all friends. We'll do  it together. Let's drink to it.
Spike,"You think you can fool me?! You were my sire, man! You were  my... Yoda!"
Angel,Things change.
Spike,"Not us! Not demons! Man, I can't believe this. You Uncle Tom!  (grabs his pole from the floor) Come on, people! This isn't a spectator  sport!"
Spike,"Fe, fi, fo fum. I smell the blood of a nice ripe (turns to face  Buffy) girl."
Buffy,(holding the ax) Do we really need weapons for this?
Spike,I just like them. They make me feel all manly.
Spike,The last Slayer I killed... she begged for her life.
Spike,You don't strike me as the begging kind.
Buffy,You shouldn'ta come here.
Spike,No. I've messed up your doilies and stuff. But I just got so  bored. (smirks) I'll tell you what. As a personal favor from me to you  I'll make it quick. It won't hurt a bit.
Buffy,"No, Spike. It's gonna hurt a lot."
Giles,"Come on, everyone. This way!"
Spike,"Now, that hurt!"
Spike,But not as much as this will.
Joyce,You get the hell away from my daughter!
Spike,Women!
Joyce,(exhales and drops the ax) Nobody lays a hand on my little girl.
Chief,Take care of this.
Snyder,"Hello, Bob."
Chief,"It's over. They all got away. I got a body inside, and I got  another one on the south lawn. And it looks like he was pulled right  through the window."
Snyder,I told him not to go through that window.
Jenny,"Well, another wonderful fun-filled evening."
Giles,"Uh, yes. You know, um, I will understand if you decide to start  avoiding me."
Xander,"So, when you gave him my neck to chew on, why didn't you clock  him before he had a chance to clock you?"
Angel,I told you. I couldn't make the first move. I had to see if he  was buying it or not.
Xander,"A-and if he bit me, what then?"
Angel,We would've known he bought it.
Xander,"Hey, what's the deal with you being Spike's sire? What's a  sire?"
Chief,I need to say something to the media people.
Snyder,So?
Chief,So? You want the usual story? Gang-related? PCP?
Snyder,What'd you have in mind? The truth?
Chief,(considers) Right. Gang-related. PCP.
Buffy,"So, what did you and Principal Snyder talk about anyway?"
Joyce,Principal Snyder said you were a troublemaker.
Joyce,And I could care less.
Joyce,"I have a daughter who can take care of herself. Who's brave and  resourceful and thinks of others in a crisis. No matter who you hang out  with or what dumb teenage stuff you think you need to do, I'm gonna  sleep better knowing all that."
Buffy,About how long till this wears off and you start ragging on me  again?
Joyce,"Oh, at least a week and a half."
Buffy,Very cool!
Cordelia,"And if you get me out of this, I swear I'll never be mean to  anyone ever again. Unless they *really* deserve it. Or if it's that time  of the month, in which case I don't think you or anyone else can hold me  responsible..."
Willow,Ask for some aspirin.
Cordelia,And can you please send some asp... Hey!
Drusilla,"Spike, did she hurt you?"
Spike,"It was close, baby, but..."
Drusilla,"Oh, come here."
Spike,A Slayer with family and friends. That sure as hell wasn't in  the brochure.
Drusilla,"You'll kill her, and then we'll have a nice celebration."
Spike,"Yeah, a party."
Drusilla,Yeah. With streamers... and songs.
Spike,(lifts his head from her shoulder) How's the annoying one?
Drusilla,He doesn't wanna play.
Spike,"Figures. Well, suppose I better go make nice."
Collin,You failed.
Spike,"I, uh... I offer penance."
Spike,"I was rash, and if I had to do it all over again... (breaks out  in laughter) Who am I kidding? (stands up) I would do it exactly the  same, only I'd do this... (grabs Collin)"
Collin,No!
Spike,...first!
Spike,"From now on, we're gonna have a little less ritual... (stops  pulling the chain) ...and a little more fun around here."
Spike,Let's see what's on TV.
