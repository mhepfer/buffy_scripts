GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
GLORY,So it's her. Under our noses all this time.
SLOOK,Glorificus will find the witch.
ANYA,Witch?
WILLOW,Tara.
GLORY,"You're not the key, you're nothing!"
WILLOW,No!
WILLOW,Tara!
BUFFY,I'm so sorry.
TARA,(smiling) They kill mice.
BEN,Not if I get the key first.
GRONX,Could you do it? Take a human life with your own hands?
GLORY,I told you this wasn't over.
TARA,(staring at Dawn) Such pure green energy!
GLORY,The key!
BUFFY,"Just pack up whatever supplies we need and that's it, we're gone."
BUFFY,Giles!
GILES,I see them.
WILLOW,Buffy!
BUFFY,How is he? Will?
BEN,"I think I got him stabilized, but there's a lot of damage. We need to get him out of here."
XANDER,We got company!
GREGOR,The key.
GREGOR,"Once the key is activated, the walls separating reality will crumble. Dimensions will bleed into each other."
BUFFY,I won't let anything happen to you.
BEN,Let me out!
BUFFY,"Will, open a door!"
BEN,No!
DAWN,Buffy!
BUFFY,Dawn!
WILLOW,"Buffy, you have to get up! Buffy, please! Buffy!"
MURK,"Quickly, quickly! Already we're behind schedule! Someone's bound for a beheading."
MURK,Let's make sure it's not me.
GRONX,Why do we remain when our moment of triumph lies so close at hand?
MURK,"(quietly) The glorious one, having acquired much in this world, doesn't exactly travel light."
GLORY,"Hey! Minions, I can hear you. God-like ears don't miss much, you know what I'm sayin'? (glares at them) Come here."
GRONX,"'Twas he who blasphemed, your magnificence."
MURK,Spurred on by treacherous urging! (Gronx hits him)
GLORY,Guys! I'm not gonna kill you. (frowns in puzzlement) Not in the mood. What do you think that's about?
GRONX,In mercy does your power lie?
GLORY,"No, brainless, in torture, death and chaos does my power lie. (frowning) So tell me, why am I not popping your head like a zit right now?"
GLORY,Maybe I'm just hungry.
MURK,"Yes, we shall fetch a, a lovely-"
GLORY,"No, I'm not hungry."
GLORY,"Uhh! Just a little tight in the skin is all. I've been waiting an eternity - well, 25 human years - and it all comes down to tonight."
GRONX,The portal shall open.
MURK,And the great Glorificus shall return.
GLORY,"To the hell I came from. Where I'm gonna rain down more super-sized portions of slaughter, mayhem and bloodshed than any of you scabs can even dream about. (pacing, sits down on a sofa) So how come I ain't happy? (shot of the minions looking confused) Got everything I ever wanted ... still, something's off."
GLORY,I don't know. What do you think?
SPIKE,Better part of a century spent in delinquency just paid off. (nods toward the door) Hotwired Ben's auto. Who's for gettin' the hell out of here?
XANDER,"All in favor, let's do it. (to Giles) You good to go?"
GILES,"Oh, don't worry about me. How's Buffy?"
XANDER,The same. (turns back to staring where Willow is staring) Still.
WILLOW,It's been almost a half an hour.
SPIKE,"(stares that way too) The Slayer's gonna be all right, won't she?"
XANDER,"You should try it again, Will."
WILLOW,"All right, but ... I'm not even sure she's, you know ... really in there."
XANDER,Try.
WILLOW,Can you hear me? Buffy!
WILLOW,Buffy!
WILLOW,(OS) Buffy?
SPIKE,(OS) Buffy!
SPIKE,"She can't just be brain-dead. (paces around behind Xander) I mean ... she's still Buffy, (Willow stands up) somewhere in there, right?"
XANDER,"Spike, come on, we're not gonna get Dawn back by sittin' around here."
SPIKE,"You're not gonna get Dawn back any way you slice it, Harris, it's for Buffy to decide."
XANDER,"Good, panic. That oughta help."
WILLOW,We should move her. U-unless we shouldn't. Should we?
ANYA,Couldn't that make it worse? I think I read that somewhere.
XANDER,I am so large with not knowing.
GILES,"It's impossible to know for sure. Losing Dawn, after all that Buffy's been through ... I think it's pushed her too far into some sort of catatonia."
SPIKE,You don't need a diploma to see that. (moves forward) Snap her out of it.
SPIKE,Buffy!
SPIKE,"Oi, rise and shine, love!"
ANYA,Spike...
SPIKE,"Come on, people. Girl's endowed with Slayer strength. It's hardly the time to get dainty. Buffy! (shakes her harder)"
XANDER,We tried that!
SPIKE,Ow! (grabs his head in pain)
ANYA,We didn't try that.
XANDER,Are you insane? We could be dealing with neurological damage here. You want to kill her?
SPIKE,"We have to do something. I can't just sit here watching. You waste time with kid gloves. I'm willing to wager, when all is said and done, Buffy likes it rough."
WILLOW,Separate.
WILLOW,"(glaring at them) Buffy's out. Glory has Dawn. Sometime real soon, she's gonna use Dawn to tear down the barrier between every dimension there is. So if you two wanna fight, do it after the world ends, okay?"
WILLOW,"(very quietly and with authority) All right. First we head back to Sunnydale. Xander'll take Giles to a hospital. Anya's looking after Tara. And Spike, you find Glory. Check her apartment, see if she's still there. Try anything stupid, like payback, and I will get Very Cranky. (looks around at them) Everyone clear?"
WILLOW,Anya.
ANYA,Um ... w-what will you do?
WILLOW,I'll help Buffy.
ANYA,Okay then.
TARA,The world is spinning.
TARA,"Straight to a new day! Big day. Big, big day."
WILLOW,"Shh, shh. (Tara whimpers)"
SPIKE,Uh ... Will?
SPIKE,"Now, uh, don't turn me into a horned toad for asking, but ... what if we come across Ben? (shot of the others listening)"
WILLOW,I-I don't think a doctor's what Buffy needs right now.
SPIKE,"Well, yeah, especially not one who also happens to be Glory. (Everyone looks confused)"
GILES,What do you mean?
SPIKE,You know. Ben is Glory.
WILLOW,(frowns) You mean ... Ben's with Glory?
XANDER,"""With"" in what sense?"
ANYA,They're working together?
SPIKE,No. No. Ben is Glory. Glory's Ben. They're one and the same.
ANYA,When did all this happen?
SPIKE,"Not one hour ago! Right here, before your very eyes! Ben came, he turned into Glory, snatched the kid, and pfft! Vanished, remember?"
SPIKE,(uncertainly) You do remember...? (squints at them) Is everyone here very stoned?
SPIKE,"(getting annoyed) Ben! Glory! He's a doctor, she's the beast. Two entirely separate entities sharing one body. Like a bloody sitcom. Surely you remember."
XANDER,So you're saying ... Ben and Glory...
ANYA,Have a connection.
GILES,"Yes, obviously, but what kind?"
SPIKE,"(laughs sarcastically) Oh, I get it. That's very crafty. (nods) Glory's worked the kind of mojo where anyone who sees her little presto-change-o instantly forgets. And yours truly, being somewhat other than human ... stands immune."
WILLOW,(frowning) So ... Ben and Glory ... are-are the same person?
XANDER,"(slowly, like a revelation) Glory can turn into Ben, and Ben turns back into Glory."
ANYA,And anyone who sees it instantly forgets.
SPIKE,(sighs in relief) Kewpie doll for the lady.
GILES,Excellent. (looks around at them) Now. Do we suspect there may be some kind of connection between Ben and Glory?
Cut to,"a man wielding a blowtorch, wearing a welding mask. He turns off the blowtorch and lifts the mask. It's the crazy guy who accosted Dawn in ""The Real Me."" We hear rhythmic machinery noises. The guy looks around, then falls to his knees as Glory enters, followed by Dawn and some minions. Glory is again wearing the robe and has Dawn by the arm. We see that we're in some sort of warehouse."
CRAZY GUY,The key. The key.
CRAZIES,The key. The key. The key.
GLORY,Unbelievable how annoying those groupies can be.
MURK,"Uh, they merely sense that tonight at last, the dimensional portal shall open."
GRONX,(OS) Ushering in the long and bloody reign of the great...
GLORY,What's he doing?
PRIEST,I must anoint the key.
GLORY,Really don't. Go.
PRIEST,But-
GLORY,"Out! Get out, get out!"
GLORY,"You know ... you recapture your godhood and unleash Armageddon... (picks up a rag from a table, uses it to rub the stuff off Dawn's forehead) all of a sudden everybody wants to be a part of the inner circle."
GLORY,You okay?
DAWN,(weakly) I wanna go home.
GLORY,Sweetie ... ohh...
GLORY,You're about to.
GLORY,"Not that fake suburban nightmare the monks cooked up for you. I mean your real home. (Dawn begins to cry) As the key! You fit the lock. Well, it's like a lock. Hey! (pats Dawn's knee) You want a pizza?"
DAWN,(softly) No.
GLORY,Pillow? (looks around) I don't know if this thing gets cable. Doubtful.
DAWN,(crying) Please. Stop.
GLORY,You nervous?
DAWN,(crying) Yes.
GLORY,"(smiles, gets down to sit on the chair seat) I know how you feel. It is your last night."
GLORY,"As, you know ... a human. (picks up Dawn's hand by the wrist and shakes it around) This body ... it's just a rental, Dawnie. Being human? It's like a costume for girls like you and me. Being something else, *that's* what we are."
DAWN,(firmly) Don't.
GLORY,(smiling) What?
DAWN,Don't call me Dawnie.
GLORY,"Huh. Wow. You know, that actually hurt my feelings."
DAWN,(whispers) I'm sorry.
GLORY,(lifts a hand) Not the point.
GLORY,"I'm just thinking, here I am trying to make you feel better, when comforting others ... not part of my life. (frowns) And I'm doing it, so I can stop ... feeling so ... (pats her chest) um ..."
GLORY,Help me out.
DAWN,(nervous) Guilty?
GLORY,"Guilty. (laughs) That's it! (laughs some more, then stops) But I'm not supposed to feel guilty. I'm not supposed to feel anything. I'm, I'm ... I'm a god. I'm above it. I'm ... (looks over at Dawn) You."
GLORY,"You did this to me, didn't you? Some sort of spell, you've been hanging with the wicca, you could've- (pauses) But no. It's not magic. It's something else. (puts her hand to her head, then looks angrily at Dawn) Still, it is you doing this."
DAWN,(shakes her head) I ... I'm not doing anything. I swear.
GLORY,We'll see.
GLORY,(glaring at Dawn) Anoint this thing now!
GLORY,"Know what they're all chanting for out there, Dawnie? Blood. 'Cause we found out your blood is the key to the key! (The priest begins marking Dawn's forehead again) All I gotta do is bleed you dry, the portal opens up, and I can go home! (priest continues chanting and marking Dawn's forehead) So knock yourself out, girlfriend. Make me feel bad as you can."
GLORY,"(softly) 'Cause tomorrow ... you bleed, little girl."
Cut to,"exterior of Xander's apartment building, night."
ANYA VOICEOVER,You sure you know what you're doing?
WILLOW,"I think so. (pause) I don't know. It's ... not exactly well-explored territory, but ... I gotta try."
ANYA,A spell like this could be really dangerous for Buffy. And you.
TARA,"Time ... oh, time is coming."
WILLOW,Shh. It's okay. I'm here.
WILLOW,You'll look after her while I'm...
ANYA,Sure. What do I do?
WILLOW,"Mostly ... just ... be here for her. (Anya nods) And, and there's some pills in my knapsack. Half of one every two hours keeps her ... pretty mellow."
ANYA,Y-you think you'll be gone more than two hours?
WILLOW,(shrugs) Wish me luck.
ANYA,Okay.
ANYA,(with forced enthusiasm) Good luck!
WILLOW,"Thanks. (turns to Tara, turns Tara's face to look at her) Okay. Be good now, sweetie. I-I'll be back as soon as I can, okay? We're good?"
ANYA,(softly) Good luck.
VOICE,"Hi, Willow."
WILLOW,"Hello, Buffy."
YOUNG BUFFY VOICEOVER,What are you doing here?
WILLOW,"Actually, I'm, uh..."
WILLOW,...looking for you.
YOUNG BUFFY,Do you like dolls? (stroking her doll's hair)
WILLOW,Buffy ... what are you doing here?
YOUNG BUFFY,I like it here.
WILLOW,But ... (kneels by her) You know we need you. You have to come out.
YOUNG BUFFY,Why?
WILLOW,To be with your friends.
YOUNG BUFFY,It's a big day for me.
WOMAN,(OS) Hello!
YOUNG BUFFY,"(big smile) Mommy, Daddy!"
YOUNG BUFFY,You're back! You're back!
JOYCE,"Hello, Buffy."
HANK,(leans over with hands on his knees) How's my girl?
JOYCE,Are you ready to meet your new baby sister?
HANK,"Oh, come on now, Buffy. She's nothing to be afraid of."
YOUNG BUFFY,Who's afraid?
JOYCE,Don't you want to be the big sister?
YOUNG BUFFY,"No, I want to be the baby."
HANK,Buffy.
YOUNG BUFFY,You're gonna pay more attention to her and forget all about me!
JOYCE,Ohh...
YOUNG BUFFY,Doesn't she look funny? Like a wrinkly old grandpa.
JOYCE,"Like this ... okay, support the head ... there you go! We're calling her Dawn."
WILLOW,(softly) Dawn.
YOUNG BUFFY,(smiling) I ... I could be the one to look after her sometimes ... if you need a helper. (Joyce smiling at the baby) Mom? Can I take care of her?
JOYCE,"(smiling, stroking Young Buffy's hair) Yes, Buffy, you can take care of her."
WILLOW,Ohh...kay.
Cut to,"Giles sitting on a hospital bed, putting on his jacket. His left arm is stiff by his side and he can only get his jacket onto the right arm. He gets up, putting his right hand to the place on his stomach where he was speared, and walks forward."
GILES,"Uh, can you, uh..."
XANDER,There. How you doing?
GILES,It only hurts while I answer pointless questions. Where's Buffy?
XANDER,"Willow's on it. Or ... in it. She's workin' some spell, trying to reach Buffy psychically."
GILES,"Uh, she's gone into Buffy's mind?"
XANDER,(nods) Pretty tricky stuff.
GILES,"It's extraordinarily advanced. Um, I was thinking we should check on Glory's victims while ... we're here."
XANDER,"Oh, the mental ward? I already been. The vegetable section's closed. Nobody there. It's like they all just got up and walked away."
SPIKE,Checked out Glory's flat. Looks like the great one has scampered.
GILES,"Gone to, uh, perform her ritual with Dawn and leaving us entirely clueless."
SPIKE,"Not entirely. (they look at him) I know this bloke. Well, not so much a bloke so much as a demon. But still, bookish. All tuned in to the nastier corners of this our magic world. (looks around, takes out a cigarette) It's a bit of a last resort really, but still, we might persuade him to suss out Glory's game plan."
SPIKE,Sound worthy?
SPIKE,(nods) Off we go then. Meet back at the shop.
SPIKE,Found Ben's room at Glory's. Didn't learn much.
XANDER,"Wait, wait, wait. Ben? At Glory's? (Spike rolls his eyes) You're saying all this time he's been subletting from her?"
SPIKE,This ... is gonna be worth it.
SPIKE/XANDER,Ow!!
SPIKE,Last time. From the top.
Cut to,"Glory leaning her arm against the wall of the warehouse, pinching her nose with her fingers. She sighs."
GLORY,"I'm hating this, Murk."
GRONX,"And this would be what exactly, your holiness?"
GLORY,"Memories. I'm starting to remember the things Ben did. People he spoke with, stuff he wore... (the minions look alarmed) Hmm! (calling to Dawn) Kid!"
GLORY,"I came ... he came to see you, didn't he?"
DAWN,Ben?
GLORY,"Yeah, Ben. You called him to the desert when you were hiding from me. And he came. And then he was me, you remember?"
DAWN,(nervously) Yes.
GLORY,(whirls to face the minions) See? She's not supposed to remember that! Nobody should! (rubs her chest anxiously) The cloak between Ben and me is fading! I almost helped her! He ... (turns back toward Dawn) I wanted to. (groans) I can't do this!
GLORY,Get him out of me.
PRIEST,What?
GLORY,"(crying) Ben! The human meat-sack who's infecting me. (turns to lean against the wall) Do your mojo, make an incision, or removal, or whatever you've gotta do. (sniffles) Help me! (pacing) I'm ... I'm thinking Ben's thoughts, and ... and I'm feeling his feelings! And ... uh! I..."
BEN,...can't kill the girl.
GLORY,Damn it.
GLORY,Help me!
PRIEST,Th-this I cannot do. You risk terrible magicks in opening the portal. Nothing comes without a price. This ... is yours.
GLORY,(gets up with a scowl) Gods don't pay.
GLORY,We do this *now*!
WILLOW,"Hey ... I know you. You're, you're the first original Slayer who tried killing us all in our dreams."
WILLOW,(shrugs) How've you been?
FIRST SLAYER,Death is your gift.
BUFFY,Death is my gift?
WILLOW,"Wait, death is her what?"
FIRST SLAYER,Death is your gift.
WILLOW,Where are you going?
MURK,"Glorificus, wait! Kill the key now and all will be lost!"
GRONX,We'll be stuck on this mortal plane forever!
GLORY,"All right, you're right. (releases Dawn) It's cool. (Dawn staggers back, clutching her throat) I'm just a little emotional right now... (small laugh) which, if you're into irony, funny."
GLORY,(OS) Leave. We need a little girl time.
GLORY,Goodbye!
GLORY,How do they do it?
DAWN,(hoarsely) Do what?
GLORY,"People! (walking toward Dawn) How do they function here like this in the world with all this bile running through them? Every day it's whoo-oo (wiggles her hand at Dawn) You have no control. They're not even animals, they're just these meatbaggy slaves to, to hormones and pheromones and their, and their feelings. Hate 'em!"
GLORY,"I mean really. Is this what the poets go on about, this? (thumps her chest, shakes her head, sighs) Call me crazy, but as hard-core drugs go, human emotion is just useless! People are puppets! Everyone getting jerked around by what they're feelin'. Am I wrong? (looks at Dawn) Really, I want to know."
GLORY,Gonna bleed you either way.
DAWN,"(opens her eyes, looks at Glory) Depends on the person."
GLORY,So you're saying some people like this.
DAWN,(defensively) Some.
GLORY,"Funny. 'Cause I look around at this world you're so eager to be a part of ... and all I see is six billion lunatics looking for the fastest ride out. (smiles) Who's not crazy? Look around. Everyone's drinking, smoking, shooting up ... shooting each other, or just plain screwing their brains out 'cause they don't want 'em anymore. (looks at Dawn) *I'm* crazy? Honey, I'm the original one-eyed chicklet in the kingdom of the blind. (sighs) 'Cause at least I admit the world makes me nuts."
GLORY,Name one person who can take it here. That's all I'm asking. (in Dawn's face) Name one.
DAWN,(firmly) Buffy.
WILLOW VOICEOVER,"I can't keep following you around like this, Buffy. We have to go."
WILLOW,You have to talk to...
WILLOW,...me.
WILLOW,I'm sorry.
BUFFY #2,"(shakes her head, doesn't look at Willow) Don't be. Death is my gift."
WILLOW,"Yeah, I keep hearing that, but... (Buffy #2 begins to walk off; Willow follows) I'm not exactly sure what it means."
BUFFY #2,(over her shoulder) It's really not that complicated.
WILLOW,Not for you maybe.
BUFFY #2,It's what I do.
BUFFY #2,"I mean, come on, you've known me ... for how long? It's what I'm here for. It's all I am."
WILLOW,"Buffy, stop! No!"
WILLOW,"God, no!"
BUFFY #2,"(turns to Willow, still holding the pillow down) What? (Dawn's struggling slows) I keep telling you, Will. I-I figured it out. Death is my gift."
GLORY,"Oh, Ben. This is really not a good time."
BEN,Dawn. Has Glory hurt you?
DAWN,Uh ... no. Not yet.
DAWN,But I have to get out of here. (nervously) Ben? You okay?
BEN,Where is it?
DAWN,W-where's what?
BEN,"(staring at his hands) All the blood. I can feel it ... still warm and ... wet. Glory. Oh, god. (Dawn looks anxious) She slaughtered hundreds of men. But I can feel them ... breaking."
DAWN,"Ben, something is happening to both you and Glory."
BEN,"I'm remembering her, aren't I? The things she's done ... things she's going to do."
DAWN,"I know. She told me. I think ... whatever the magic is that keeps you guys apart, it's starting to break down. (he continues looking upset) Ben, Glory could come back any minute."
BEN,(not seeming to hear her) How could she do this?
DAWN,"I don't know. But we have to get out of her and, and find Buffy-"
BEN,"No! (turns to her) I mean, I have a job. I have a life! And Glory? She never once thinks about me in all this!"
DAWN,Help me.
BEN,How?
DAWN,I-
PRIEST,(OS) Highness!
DAWN,Please.
PRIEST,(OS) Is everything all right?
PRIEST,You're not-
BEN,"(to Dawn) I'll take you as far as I can, ditch you before she comes back."
WILLOW VOICEOVER,Okay ... now this is weird.
YOUNG BUFFY,"Hi, Willow. What are you doing here?"
WILLOW,"Actually, I'm, uh ... looking for you. Here. Again."
YOUNG BUFFY,(strokes her doll's hair) Do you like dolls?
WILLOW,No ... (kneels) and I think we already deja'd this vu.
YOUNG BUFFY,(giggles) You talk funny.
WILLOW,Yes ... as you'll tell me again when we're older and in chem class. (frowns) Buffy ... what are we doing here?
YOUNG BUFFY,Don't you like it here?
WILLOW,We don't have time.
YOUNG BUFFY,"Mommy, Daddy!"
HANK,(OS) We're home!
YOUNG BUFFY,"(OS) You're back, you're back!"
JOYCE,"(smiling) Hi, Buffy."
JOYCE,We're calling her Dawn.
YOUNG BUFFY,I could be the one to look after her sometimes.
Cut to,"a fire burning in a fireplace. Pan across a desk covered with books, papers, and an old manual typewriter. Doc (see episode ""Forever"") sits at the desk holding a mug, flipping pages of a book. Sound of knocking on the door. He doesn't get up."
DOC,It's always open!
DOC,(OS) What can I do for you boys? Want some cocoa?
SPIKE,No. We need information. We need-
XANDER,(suddenly) Ben's Glory!
DOC,(looks up) Who's what?
SPIKE,(surprised) Look at this. Special Ed remembers.
XANDER,Yeah. I do. Ben's Glory and Glory's Ben. It's like this... (gestures around his head) fog's lifting.
SPIKE,(nodding) Wonderful. But not why we're here. (turns back to Doc) Hell-god type. (Doc returns to his book) Name of Glory-
XANDER,A.K.A. Ben.
SPIKE,"-has gone missing. She's brewing up some major-league bad, and she's nicked the Slayer's kid sister in the bargain."
DOC,"(looking at him, nodding) Hmm. That girl you brought here. Sweet little thing. How'd things work out with her mom? Changed her mind, didn't she?"
SPIKE,Yeah. You got any idea where Glory would take her?
DOC,"(closes his book, thoughtfully) Glory ... Glory. Oh! (gets up, carrying the book) You don't mean Glorificus. (walks closer to them) Gosh. What do you wanna get mixed up with her for? That's a sure way to get yourselves killed. I hear she's awfully unpleasant. (turns away, goes toward a side table) When it comes to hellgods, my best advice ... is get out of the way ... and stay there. (puts the book down)"
SPIKE,Love to. Can't.
DOC,"Well, uh, other than that ... (turns to a chest of drawers, closes a drawer) I'd like to help ... but I-I'm a small-town guy."
DOC,"This Glorificus, if it is her ... whoo, she's big city."
SPIKE,She's got Dawn.
DOC,"Right. (thinks) Well, I may know a fella ... you know, who knows a fella in... (thinks) in China. He might-"
SPIKE,How the hell are we supposed to get to China? Teleport?
DOC,I guess.
DOC,"You know, if you're in that much of a hurry."
DOC,Wish you luck.
SPIKE,You're lying.
SPIKE,And what's more ... I believe you're standing right in front of the very thing we need.
DOC,(whispers) Idiot.
DOC,You think only underworld bottom-feeders worship the beast?
DOC,"Her day is coming, boys! (grabs Spike by the front of his shirt) And when she returns, then you're gonna see something."
SPIKE,Ow!
XANDER,What do we got?
SPIKE,(looking down at Doc) Something worth dying for.
WILLOW VOICEOVER,"Buffy, will you just stop a second and listen to me?"
WILLOW,Buffy!
WILLOW,You have to stop doing this.
BUFFY #2,Doing what?
WILLOW,Killing Dawn.
BUFFY #2,Why?
WILLOW,Because this never happened. You never killed your sister.
BUFFY #2,"Will, I did this."
WILLOW,In your imagination! None of this is real! Y-you're stuck in some kind of loop!
BUFFY #2,I don't know what you're talking about. 'Scuse me.
WILLOW,"Buffy, why are you doing this?"
DAWN,I think they see us.
BEN,Just stay close to me. Don't look back.
BEN,Shh! Stay very still.
DAWN,I'm sorry.
GLORY,(OS) Sorry?!
GLORY,"That actually hurt, you prepubescent puke."
GLORY,"Okay, first thought, just totally spontaneous, unfiltered, off the top of my head ... ow!"
GLORY,"You hit Ben in his soft human head, and I remember the pain."
GLORY,You probably think I won't waste any precious blood of yours till tonight. You're right. But I know a thousand ways to hurt you that won't spill a drop.
GLORY,"You know all those pesky feelings Ben's been having like guilt, empathy? I'm gonna take 'em and mash 'em back down where they belong, okay? Now ... (strokes the side of Dawn's face) let's have big-girl fun. (grabs Dawn's chin) Just you and..."
GLORY,Leave her alone.
BEN,"I said, leave her alone."
Morph. (<b>Note,</b> from this point on the morphing happens so fast I won't note it each time. Just assume that they change each time there's a change in speaker.)
GLORY,"No, no. Little late in the game to start growing a backbone, Benjamin. (Dawn watches fearfully) Now be good and stay quiet. No you don't! Get over yourself, Ben! This is the way things are! I'm strong, you're weak. (laughs) This is reality. Stop trying to infect me with your... (whirls around)"
BEN,"Do you ever stop talking? I don't know which is worse, waking up in a dress not knowing where I've been, or having to hear all your self-involved ranting!"
GLORY,Animal.
BEN,"Wrong, Glory. I'm no animal. This is humanity you're feeling. Welcome to the world."
GLORY,"No, no, no!"
GLORY,"Stick around, chica."
BEN,"I won't let you hurt her, Glory."
GLORY,"Ooh, shut your hole, you sanctimonious little meatworm. (advances on the frightened Dawn) I'm going home no matter what you do."
BEN,You really think I'll just let that happen?
GLORY,"Benjamin, what are you doing?"
BEN,"You need her blood? When I'm through there won't be enough left to fill a bottle cap. Then you, hellbitch, have nowhere left-"
GLORY,-to go. Huh!
GLORY,"You can't hurt her and you know it, Ben. (sits down on a pile of bricks) I know it 'cause I feel what you're feeling. Scared. Shh! Shh! It's okay! You don't wanna die. Who would? I don't."
BEN,"You can't, you're immortal."
GLORY,"Nobody has to die here, Ben. Just let me bleed the girl and go home. Everything will work out fine."
BEN,Do you really believe with all I know that you can trick me?
GLORY,"Stop ... and think, baby. We bleed the kid, return me to my seat of power, I become a god again..."
BEN,And I disappear.
GLORY,"Ooh, unless somebody up there likes you. Give up the girl ... I could like you a lot."
BEN,"I won't make a deal with you, Glory."
GLORY,(angry) When exactly did you get stupid? I'm offering immortality here.
BEN,"I believe you. That's not the problem. You make me immortal, then what? (walks over to Dawn, grabs her arm and pulls her to her feet) I'd have to kill her to do it and I won't be able to live with that, not even for a day, forget about eternity!"
GLORY,"Baby, baby, baby Ben. (lets go of Dawn who falls to the ground again) Why do you worry so much? When you're immortal, all this crap you've been carrying around inside ... (leans against the wall) the guilt, the anger, the crazy-making pain ... (smiles) Ooh, it all just melts away like ice cream. Trust me. When all this is over I can set you up real nice. I'm making it easy. It's you ... or the girl."
BEN,(panting) I can't accept that.
GLORY,"Accept it. (chuckles) I'm a god, stupid."
BEN,I'm sorry.
DAWN,No!
BEN,Don't make this harder than it already is.
BEN,"I'm sorry, I got no choice. It's you or me."
Cut to,Joyce's bedroom/grave. Lingering shot of the headstone.
WILLOW,"No. Buffy! Leave Dawn alone, what is this?"
BUFFY #2,(opening the door) My gift. This is what I do.
WILLOW,"I'm not talking about this, I'm talking about..."
WILLOW,...this.
WILLOW,"Right here, it happened. I know it's something small, but... (shot of Buffy #1 putting the book on the shelf again) it's something. What?"
BUFFY #2,"(staring at Buffy #1) Don't go there, Will."
WILLOW,I'm not! You're the one who keeps dragging me back here! A-and you wouldn't be doing that if you weren't trying to show me something.
BUFFY #2,(looks at her) Do I?
WILLOW,"Buffy, come on. I-it's your brain. Just tell me."
WILLOW,What happened here?
BUFFY #1,"(not turning) This was when I quit, Will."
WILLOW,You did?
BUFFY #2,Just for a second.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,I remember.
BUFFY #1,(facing Willow) I was in the magic shop.
BUFFY #2,I put a book back for Giles.
BUFFY #1,Nothing special about it. And then it hit me.
WILLOW,What hit you?
BUFFY #2,I can't beat Glory.
BUFFY #1,Glory's going to win.
WILLOW,(turns to Buffy #2) You can't know that.
BUFFY #2,(turns to Willow) I didn't just know it.
BUFFY #1,(staring at nothing) I felt it. Glory will beat me.
BUFFY #2,"(looks away) And in that second of knowing it, Will..."
BUFFY #1,I wanted it to happen.
WILLOW,Why?
BUFFY #1,I wanted it over. This is ... all of this ... it's too much for me.
BUFFY #2,(staring at nothing) I just wanted it over.
BUFFY #1,If Glory wins ... then Dawn dies.
BUFFY #2,And I would grieve. People would feel sorry for me. (looks at Willow) But it would be over. (looks away) And I imagined what a relief it would be.
BUFFY #2,I killed Dawn.
WILLOW,Is that what you think?
BUFFY VOICEOVER,My thinking it made it happen.
BUFFY #1,Some part of me wanted it. And in the moment Glory took Dawn...
BUFFY #2,I know I could have done something better. But I didn't. I was off by some fraction of a second.
BUFFY #1,And this is why...
BUFFY #2,...I killed my sister.
WILLOW,I think Spike was right back at the gas station. (loudly) Snap out of it!
BUFFY #1,What?
BUFFY #2,What?
WILLOW,"All this ... it has a name. It's called guilt. (the two Buffys exchange a look) It's a feeling, and it's important. (to Buffy #2) But it's not more than that, Buffy. (glances at Buffy #1) Buffys."
WILLOW,"You've carried the weight of the world on your shoulders since high school. And I, I know you didn't ask for this, but ... you do it every day. And so, you wanted out for one second. So what?"
BUFFY #2,(pensive) I got Dawn killed.
WILLOW,"Hello! Your sister, not dead yet! But she will be if you stay locked inside here and never come back to us."
BUFFY #2,(looking at Buffy #1) But what if I can't?
WILLOW,Then I guess you're right. And you did kill your sister.
BUFFY #2,Wait!
BUFFY VOICEOVER,Where are you going?
WILLOW,Where you're needed. Are you coming?
GILES,Buffy? (aside) She's back.
XANDER,You're okay?
BUFFY,Yeah. I'm okay.
BUFFY,Hear you found the ritual text.
GILES,"Uh, something like that, yes."
XANDER,Did you know that ... Ben is Glory?
BUFFY,So I'm told. What do we know?
GILES,"Um ... well, uh ... (Willow, Anya, and Tara sit around the table) ...according to these scrolls, uh, it's possible for Glory to be stopped."
GILES,"I-I'm afraid it's, um ... well, Buffy, I've read these things very carefully and there's not much ... margin for error. You understand what I'm saying?"
BUFFY,Might help if you actually said it.
GILES,Um ... Glory ... plans to open a ... dimensional portal ... by way of a ritual bloodletting.
BUFFY,Dawn's blood.
GILES,Yes. (pause) Once the blood is shed at a certain time and place ... the fabric which separates all realities will ... be ripped apart.
GILES,"Dimensions will ... pour into one another, uh, with no barriers to stop them. (shot of Xander and Anya listening) Reality as we know it will be destroyed, and ... chaos will reign on earth."
BUFFY,So how do we stop it?
GILES,"The portal will only close once the blood is stopped ... and the only way for that to happen is, um ..."
GILES,"Buffy, the only way is to kill Dawn."
