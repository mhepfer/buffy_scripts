BUFFY,What are you doing?
GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
PARAMEDIC,Your mother's dead.
BUFFY,She just wouldn't believe me.
DAWN,Oh god.
BUFFY,I still don't think she does.
DAWN,I'm not real.
BEN,"You're the key. Go, before she finds you. She's here."
GILES,"Buffy, you're here."
GILES,You all right?
BUFFY,Yeah.
DIRECTOR,Did you find something?
BUFFY,(nods) This one.
DIRECTOR,(OS) It's a fine choice. It speaks of your deep feeling for the deceased.
BUFFY,You don't like it?
DAWN,"(still looking at the coffin) No, it's not that. It's just ... what if Mom ... what if she'd like something else better?"
BUFFY,Dawn...
DAWN,"I mean, how do we know for sure? She's the one who has to be in it forever."
BUFFY,"Dawn, maybe it wasn't such a good idea you coming along."
DAWN,(turns to look at her) It's fine. It's just ...
BUFFY,I'm serious. Y-you shouldn't have to deal with this stuff.
DIRECTOR,If you'd like a few more minutes to decide-
BUFFY,"No. I, it's done, it's fine. (to Dawn) Okay?"
BUFFY,Okay.
GILES,"(OS) I checked prices at different florists, and the funeral home seems to be fairly competitive."
BUFFY,"Let's just go with that, it's easier."
DAWN,(sits at the other end) What color flowers?
BUFFY,"Uh, white. (looks at Giles) They're nice."
GILES,Yeah.
BUFFY,"(to Giles) Uh, what about an announcement? People are gonna be expecting a wake after the burial unless we say something."
GILES,"Um, well, we could put a, a line in the program expressing your mother's preference not to have one."
WILLOW,There's no wake?
BUFFY,Mom didn't like them. She said that potlucks are depressing enough as it is.
DAWN,She said that? When?
BUFFY,"Uh, right before she went in for the operation. We had a talk about what she wanted ... in case. (looks down)"
DAWN,She never said anything to me.
XANDER,"I'm sure she just didn't wanna upset you, Dawnster. Now you better get to work on that dinner. You barely touched it."
BUFFY,You really should eat something.
DAWN,Why should I? You're not.
BUFFY,This isn't about-
BUFFY,(to Giles) I'm all phoned out. Will you? Unless it's my dad.
GILES,Of course.
GILES,"Hello? Yes, yes they did. (Buffy looks at him) Thank you. (gets up) The, uh, funeral is at, uh, three tomorrow. Do you know the Brown Brothers mortuary?"
BUFFY,Can't believe he still hasn't called.
XANDER,"Your dad's still AWOL, huh?"
BUFFY,"The number he left for us in Spain is no good, and I've left messages everywhere. Um, how about a line that just says, 'Following the burial, there will be no wake'? Or gathering? (Shot of Willow thinking about it) 'At the request of Joyce, there will be no gathering'? Uch, that sounds lame."
DAWN,"What are we gonna do? After, I mean. Are we just gonna ... come back here?"
BUFFY,"Uh ... I, I don't know. I guess so. Um, how about 'At the request of the family, there will be no wake.'"
XANDER,"(gets up to move into the chair next to Buffy) Good, yeah, it's got, uh..."
DAWN,(to herself) I don't wanna be here.
BUFFY,"Should I put it at the top, or just a small line at the bottom?"
DAWN,Can I go to your place tomorrow?
WILLOW,Tomorrow?
DAWN,After everything.
WILLOW,"Um, well, maybe you and Buffy should ... I-I don't mind."
DAWN,(to Buffy) Can I?
BUFFY,(looks up from discussing with Xander) Huh?
DAWN,Can I go to Willow's tomorrow after the service?
BUFFY,"(looks at Willow, uncertainly) Um ... i-if you want to. I guess so."
DAWN,"I'll, uh, get my sleeping bag out of the attic."
Cut to,Willow and Xander leaving the house. Xander closes the door and they start down the porch steps.
XANDER,You going home?
WILLOW,I'm gonna stop by my mom's first. Been doing that a lot lately.
XANDER,"Yeah. I actually might stop by your mom's too. (she looks at him) Well, I'm not going to *my* place. Those people are scary. (looks up) Speaking of."
XANDER,You have got to be kidding.
SPIKE,(sighs) I'm not going in.
XANDER,And you're not leaving those.
XANDER,You actually think you're gonna score points with Buffy this way?
SPIKE,This isn't about Buffy. (walks closer)
XANDER,Bull. We're all hip to your doomed obsession.
SPIKE,They're for Joyce.
XANDER,Like you care about her.
WILLOW,"Guys, guys, not here."
SPIKE,Care? Joyce was the only one of the lot of you that I could stand.
XANDER,And she's the only one with a daughter you wanted to shag. I'm touched.
SPIKE,"I liked the lady. Understand, monkey boy? She was decent. (Xander and Willow exchange a look) She didn't put on airs. She always had a nice cuppa for me."
SPIKE,And she never treated me like a freak.
XANDER,Her mistake.
SPIKE,(scoffs) Think what you want.
XANDER,Un ... believable.
XANDER,The guy thinks he can put on a big show and con Buffy into being his sex monkey.
WILLOW,(looking at flowers) Xander... (he looks at her) He didn't leave a card.
Cut to,"a wall covered with old black-and-white pictures of people and children. Pan across the wall. It's the hallway in the upstairs of the Summers house. Through the open door, we see Buffy sitting on her bed staring at nothing. Pan across more photos. We see Dawn sitting on her bed doing the same."
Fade to,"graveyard, daylight. Aerial shot of a group of people standing around the coffin. Fade to a shot of Buffy and Dawn standing together. We can see Xander and Giles behind them. Fade to a shot of the coffin."
MINISTER,(OS) We commend to almighty God...
MINISTER,"(OS) ...our sister, Joyce Summers..."
MINISTER,(OS) ...and we commit her body to the ground.
MINISTER,(OS) Earth to earth... (shot of Giles) ...ashes to ashes... (shot of Buffy and Dawn. Dawn winces. Pan across the others) ...and dust to dust.
MINISTER,(OS) The Lord bless her and keep her.
MINISTER,(OS) The Lord makes his face to shine upon her and be gracious to her.
MINISTER,(OS) The Lord lift up his countenance upon her...
MINISTER,(OS) ...and give her peace.
TARA,"Hey, um, Dawn's kind of ready to go. Can we take her with us?"
BUFFY,Yeah. She should probably get out of here.
TARA,What about you? We can wait if you want.
BUFFY,I'm fine. Thank you.
ANGEL,I'm sorry.
ANGEL,I couldn't come sooner.
WILLOW,"Oh, Dawn. I wish I could ... help more. (Dawn doesn't look at her) The only thing is ... it'll get better. I promise."
DAWN,(looks at her) You don't know that.
TARA,Sure she does. We're witches. We know stuff.
DAWN,"What? (looks from one to the other, sits up) Life goes on, and I forget Mom? (angry) Is that what you're saying?"
WILLOW,"Not forget, no! I, you... (looks to Tara for help)"
TARA,You make a place for her in your heart. It's sort of like she becomes a part of you. Does that make sense?
WILLOW,"(nods hopefully) Dawn ... hey, we don't have to talk about this now, uh, you could just go to sleep."
DAWN,No. (gets up) I don't wanna sleep.
TARA,"Okay, we can just ... sit, or, or whatever you want."
DAWN,Good. 'Cause I know ... what I wanna do now.
WILLOW,Great. (she and Tara get up) What are you up for?
DAWN,You guys are witches ... and you do ... magic and ... stuff.
WILLOW,"You want us to teach you something? Uh, like a-a glamour, or, or, I could ... make a stuffed animal dance."
DAWN,I wanna do a spell. I wanna bring Mom back.
ANYA,"Mm. (breathing heavily, lies down and puts her head on Xander's chest) That was different."
XANDER,(breathing heavily) Yeah. It was more ... intense.
ANYA,(nods) It's because of Joyce.
XANDER,Right. (pause) Huh?
ANYA,"Well, she got me thinking ... about ... how people die all the time, and ... how they get born too, and how you kind of need one so you can have the other. When I think about it that way, it ... makes death a little less sad, and ... sex a little more exciting."
XANDER,"Again I say, huh?"
ANYA,"Well, I just think I understand sex more now. It's not just about two bodies smooshing together. It's about life. (Xander looks a little alarmed) It's about *making* life."
XANDER,"(alarmed) Right, when ... two people are much older, and ... way richer, and far less stupid."
ANYA,"(lifts her head to look at him, laughs) Breathe. You're turning colors. I'm not ready to make life with you, but I could. *We* could. Life could come out of our love and our smooshing, and that's beautiful. (Xander looks relieved) It all makes me feel like I'm part of something bigger. Like I'm more awake somehow. (smiles) You know?"
XANDER,"Yeah, I do."
TARA,"(steps forward) Of course you wanna bring your mother back, and ... I wish we could, but it's not possible."
DAWN,Why? You guys do magic for all kinds of things.
WILLOW,"We do, but..."
TARA,This is different. Magic can't be used to alter the natural order of things.
DAWN,"But all you do is mess with the natural order of things. You, you make things float, a-and disappear, and-"
TARA,"But we don't mess with life and death. (Shot of Willow looking upset) Dawn, I know how bad you hurt."
DAWN,You don't. (upset) They put her in the ground.
TARA,"They did, and it's awful and unfair, but this isn't the way."
WILLOW,"I'm not even sure it's possible, Dawn. I mean, I've ... seen things on resurrection, but ... there's books and stuff ... but I guess ... the spells ... backfire?"
TARA,That's not the point.
WILLOW,"That's not the point. The, the point is it's bad ... because ..."
TARA,Because witches can't be allowed to alter the fabric of life for selfish reasons. Wiccans took an oath a long time ago to honor that.
DAWN,So it's possible ... to bring someone back? They wouldn't have taken an oath if thy didn't know they could do it.
TARA,"Maybe they could, but we can't."
WILLOW,"She's right, Dawn. It's too dangerous."
DAWN,You said you wanted to help me.
WILLOW,Dawn...
Cut to,"graveyard, night. Pan across trees and graves. We discover Buffy and Angel sitting on the ground under a tree, leaning against it. Buffy has her legs curled under her and leans against Angel's shoulder. They both look at the grave as they talk."
BUFFY,"The funeral was ... (sighs) it was brutal, but it's tomorrow that I'm worried about."
ANGEL,What's tomorrow?
BUFFY,"That's exactly what I don't know. Up until now, I ... I've had a road map. Things to do every minute, having to do with Mom."
ANGEL,Tomorrow the stuff of everyday living resumes.
BUFFY,"And everybody expects me to know how to do it, because ... (sarcastically) I'm so strong."
ANGEL,You just need some time. I'm sure everybody understands that.
BUFFY,Time's not the issue. I can stick wood in vampires ... but Mom was the strong one in real life. She always knew how to make things better ... just what to say.
ANGEL,"Yeah ... you'll find your way. I mean, not all at once, but..."
BUFFY,(shakes her head) I don't know. I keep thinking about it ... when I found her. If I had just gotten there ten minutes earlier...
ANGEL,You said they told you it wouldn't have made a difference.
BUFFY,"They said ... ""probably"" ... wouldn't have made a difference. The exact thing they said ... was ""probably."" I haven't told that to anyone."
ANGEL,Doesn't make it your fault. You couldn't have done anything different.
BUFFY,(annoyed sigh) I didn't even start CPR until they told me. I fell apart. That's how good I am at being a grownup.
ANGEL,Buffy...
BUFFY,And it'd be okay if it was just me I had to worry about. But Dawn...
ANGEL,"Look, it's okay. I know you don't feel like it now, but you are strong, Buffy. You're gonna figure this out. And you have people to help you. You don't have to do this alone."
BUFFY,(looks at the sky) It's gonna be light soon.
ANGEL,I can stay in town as long as you want me.
BUFFY,How's forever? Does forever work for you?
BUFFY,(apologetically) That's a bad idea. I'm seriously needy right now.
ANGEL,Let me worry about the neediness. I can handle it.
BUFFY,(looks down) I told you. (Angel sighs) You better go.
ANGEL,(another sigh) I'm sorry.
BUFFY,"(firmly) No. I'm so grateful that you came, Angel. I didn't think I was gonna be able to make it through the night."
ANGEL,"(looks up at the sky) Well, we still have a few more minutes until I have to go."
BUFFY,Good.
BUFFY,Good.
Cut to,"exterior hospital, night. Ben walks out, wearing a jacket over his hospital scrubs. He turns a corner and see Jinx lurking. Jinx sees Ben and walks toward him."
BEN,(angrily) Tell my sister I'm sick of running into her Jawa rejects.
JINX,She ... bade me come to you. The news of your relationship with the Slayer-
BEN,We don't have a relationship.
JINX,"But ... you attempted to court her, did you not?"
BEN,You're more fun when I hit you.
JINX,"It's just, Glory ... would like to encourage this interest of yours in the Slayer. It might lead to more information about the key."
BEN,And why would I share that with the most unstable one?
JINX,"Time ... is running short, sir. Every moment you fight Glory, you're only fighting yourself, you see?"
BEN: Fine. Let the best me win. Let Glory understand this,I won't help her find the key. I would never do that to an innocent- (stops himself)
JINX,An innocent? The key? That's an interesting choice of words.
BEN,"No, that, that's not what I-"
JINX,"I understand, sir. I'm sorry to have bothered you, I'll ... take my leave."
BEN,"You understand what? When I said it's innocent, I didn't mean that the key is ... it's not a person."
JINX,Of course not.
BEN,"You're gonna run and tell her, aren't you? Do you understand what's going to happen if she finds the key? How many people are going to die?"
JINX,"Please, I heard nothing."
BEN,I can't let that happen.
BEN,Don't you see?
BEN,I can't.
Cut to,"Dawn lying on the floor, covered with a blanket. We see her from the back."
WILLOW,(OS) We're heading down to breakfast.
DAWN,I'm not hungry.
WILLOW,"Oh. Okay. (We see Tara standing nearby, holding schoolbooks. Dawn sits up) It's just, we have class after that, and I, I didn't know if you want to go home, or..."
DAWN,I was gonna sleep some more. Giles said he'd pick me up whenever.
WILLOW,"Oh, okay, great. Sure, uh,  hang out. (smiling) I have a, a break around lunchtime. I can come back."
DAWN,(sullen) I might not be here.
WILLOW,"(still smiling) Well, I'll try my luck."
TARA,"Take care, Dawn."
DAWN,(reading table of contents) 'Age of Levitation ... War of the Warlocks...' (flips pages) 'Resurrection -- A Controversy Born.'
Cut to,"exterior magic shop, day."
GILES,"You don't have to do that, Dawn, just, just relax."
ANYA,"Yes, sit down. We have some very amusing chicken feet you can play with."
DAWN,That's okay.
ANYA,Don't you watch television? I thought all children despise effort and enjoy cartoons.
DAWN,"(rearranges some books) Um, I like being useful. It keeps my mind off things."
GILES,(approaches) Then useful you shall be. I can always use a hand.
ANYA,(anxious) But you have a hand. A paid hand. A hand that isn't the hand of illegal child labor.
GILES,(rolls his eyes) Anya.
ANYA,"(nods in understanding, turns to Dawn) But of course, it's wonderful that you find doing my job so distracting. (smiles) I am unthreatened. Proceed. (walks away)"
GILES,"Yes, uh, carry on, Dawn."
DAWN,"Is there anything I should know, like, um, off-limits stuff? Willow told me that some of the books and things are ... kind of dangerous?"
GILES,"Quite right. Um, but they're all labeled, and, and, and, uh, kept off the floor. Most of our, uh, more potent texts and potions are all up there."
GILES,"If anyone asks you about anything in that area, just come and get me. (turns away)"
DAWN,Okay. Anything else?
GILES,"Oh, um, well, if you like, uh, I could teach you how to ... work the cash register, you can ring up sales."
DAWN,Cool.
ANYA,(approaching) Ring up sales? With the money? She gets to fondle the money?
ANYA,"(excited) Customer! (walks off) Hello, customer!"
GILES,"(to Dawn, resigned) I'll just be a moment. (moves off)"
ANYA,(in background) I'll help you!
DAWN,(as Giles passes her) No problem.
GILES,Dawn.
DAWN,Uh-huh? (quietly lets her backpack drop to the floor)
GILES,"Do you wanna come watch this, uh, transaction that Anya's doing? Then I'll let you try."
DAWN,You got it.
Cut to,"graveyard, night. Dawn kneels by the fresh grave, opening a jar. Overhead shot of her. She scoops some dirt from the grave into the jar and caps it. She reaches over to smooth down the remaining dirt, looks around nervously, brushes her hands off. We see someone come up behind her."
SPIKE,I hope it's just dirt you're after.
SPIKE,"If the spell calls for anything more than that, you're into zombie territory, and that's bad news."
DAWN,"(shakes her head anxiously) Spike, I-I wasn't..."
SPIKE,I know good and well what you're up to. That book you've got is infamous.
DAWN,Please ... don't tell Buffy. I just ... I have to get her back. (anguished) I have to.
SPIKE,"I'm not gonna tell, little bit."
SPIKE,I'm gonna help.
SINGER,...<I>you touch the distant beaches with tales of brave Ulysses</I>...
SINGER,<I>How his naked ears were tortured by the sirens sweetly singing</I>...
SINGER,<I>For the sparkling waves are calling you to kiss their white-laced lips</I>...
SPIKE,"I've never used this bloke's services myself, but there's talk. Word is he knows everything there is to know about resurrection spells."
SPIKE,"Come on now, no worries."
DAWN,You don't have to be all nice to me. I know why you're doing this.
SPIKE,Do you now? Enlighten me.
DAWN,"(frowns, stops walking) Spike, I'm not stupid. You're, like, stalking my sister. (Spike stops, turns to look at her) You'd do anything to get in good with her."
SPIKE,"(takes a few steps closer; firmly) Buffy never hears about this, okay? (looks around) Found out what I was doing, she'd drive a redwood through my chest."
DAWN,"Then, if you don't want credit, why are you helping me?"
SPIKE,"(looking at the ground, quietly) I just don't like to see Summers women take it so hard on the chin, is all. (looks up, speaks angrily) And I'm dead serious. You breathe a word of this to Buffy, I'll see to it that *you* end up in the ground. Got it?"
DAWN,Yeah. Got it.
Cut to,"Glory's apartment. Glory is walking down the stairs into the living room, followed by several sycophant demons."
GLORY,Where is he? He should have been back hours ago.
MURK,"I'm sure Jinx is on his way, your ... new and improvedness. He's most loyal to-"
GLORY,Hey! He better be loyal.
GLORY,Jinxie?
GLORY,"Oh, no, no! Oh, mind the rug, honeys, blood's a bitch. (to Jinx) Was this the Slayer, I'll pull her wings off!"
JINX,No.
JINX,It was Ben.
GLORY,"Ben? (turns away) Ben? Oh god, you pointless, stupid lout! Oh, I hate you, I hate you, (pulls several handfuls of hair off her head) I hate youuuuu!"
JINX,The key! He told me.
GLORY,The key?
GLORY,What about the key?
JINX,"He indicated that it was a person, most ... (searching for words) ... highest ... you."
GLORY,(smiling hopefully) The key's in human form?
JINX,I believe so ... (searching for words) good one.
GLORY,(delighted) Ahh!
GLORY,"Jinx, you robed stud, you're my man! I'm even gonna let you slide on the lame toadying on account of your dying and stuff."
GLORY,"So, the key's all secreted away in a flesh wrapper! (gets up and paces) This narrows the search from now on in a serious way, I mean we didn't have a clue. It could have been a log, or, or a bicycle pump, or whatever, am I right?"
GLORY,"Uch, get him fixed, would ya? (smiling, plops down on another sofa) I wanna hear the whole story again, without all that annoying moaning."
Cut to,"an apartment. A black cat jumps over a globe in the foreground and runs offscreen as the door opens and we see Spike. He holds the door open for Dawn, who enters cautiously."
DAWN,This place belongs to a magic guy? It smells like grandpa.
SPIKE,Hey!
SPIKE,Anybody home?
DOC,I know you.
SPIKE,"I don't think so, mate."
DOC,"No, no, you're that guy, that, that guy, hangs around down at the corner mart. (Spike looks confused) Big into dominoes, aren't you?"
SPIKE,"Can't say as I am. Look, we came here because- (stops because Doc is laughing)"
DOC,"That's crazy, isn't it? I mean, I, I, I'd swear, you were that guy. (Dawn looks nervous) I mean, your hair's a different color and you're a vampire, but uh, other than that..."
DAWN,(to Spike) Maybe we should just go.
DOC,"No. Now, just because the lights are dim doesn't mean the juice is all gone. What can I do for you?"
SPIKE,This one's mum kicked it a few days back.
DOC,Ohh. I'm so sorry. (Dawn looks down)
SPIKE,"So we were wondering, what's to be done about it. Heard you were the one to ask."
DOC,"(concerned) Ohh ... no, no, that's, uh, you don't wanna mess with that. Uh, I know some tonics, uh, make the grieving fly by-"
DAWN,(shakes head) I don't want any tonics.
DOC,"Either one of you witches? Got any experience with, uh, spells of this magnitude?"
DOC,Didn't think so.
DAWN,Ow!
DOC,"Well, your mother's a good candidate, at least. Strong DNA."
DAWN,Right.
DAWN,I've gathered some ingredients. But the spell I found ... there's things on it I don't understand.
DOC,"We've got the ghora demon standing between you and success, that's the translation you were missing."
SPIKE,"Ghora, I've heard of those. They local?"
DOC,"Yeah, they like to stick close to the hellmouth. (Spike nods. Doc reads from the book) Egg of the ghora gives life. (looks up at Dawn) It's key to the spell."
DAWN,"Can you buy it, this ... egg, or-"
DOC,"If it was as easy as making an omelet, everyone would try it. (Dawn looks chastised) No. You have to steal the egg from the nest of the demon. (looks at Spike) And the ghora won't be happy about it."
SPIKE,Where do we find this demon?
DOC,"First things first. We'll need an image of your mother. A photo, a painting."
DAWN,No problem.
DOC,"Once you get all the ingredients together, put them in the center (makes circular gestures) of a sacred circle. With the photo of your mother. (Dawn nods) Then... (reaches for a small notebook) say this incantation... (begins to write) three times. (Spike listens closely) She won't appear, you know, poof. (Dawn listens very carefully) It'll take ... a while, (smiling) but she will come to you. (tears off the page, hands it to Dawn) Got it?"
DAWN,Got it.
DOC,"Oh. Anything goes wrong, the only way to reverse the spell ... is to destroy the image of your mother, understand?"
DAWN,I'll do it right.
DOC,"It's a tricky spell, girl. I can't say for sure your mother will come back exactly like she was. (shots of Dawn and Spike listening) Sometimes these ... things ... get a little off."
DAWN,But she'll still be my mother. (frowns) Won't she?
DOC,More or less.
DAWN,(weakly) Good. (a little stronger) Good.
SPIKE,And the ghora?
DOC,"Oh, right, sorry. Um, go in the sewer entrance near Tracy Street. The opening's, um, on the left. Can't miss it. Just follow that down."
DOC,"No, no. Keep your money. (smiles, removes his glasses)"
DAWN,Oh. Thank you.
DOC,You just keep in touch now. Let me know how it goes.
DAWN,I-I-I will.
DAWN,It's here. Just like he said.
SPIKE,"(looking into the hole) Well, at least we know the old coot isn't completely daft. Look, you better let me snatch this egg thing on my own."
DAWN,No way. I'm going.
SPIKE,(firmly) No ... you are not. I've got no idea what's down there.
DAWN,"You need me, Spike. Somebody's gotta get the egg while you distract the ghora. Now come on."
SPIKE,"Well, what do you know. Bitty Buffy."
DAWN,Doesn't look so bad.
SPIKE,(scoffs) Wait till it wakes up. That's usually when the bad starts.
DAWN,I can't get to the eggs unless it moves. No way.
SPIKE,(grinning) I'll make it move. You just be ready.
SPIKE,Hey! Ghora! Heads up.
SPIKE,(staring) Right then. Heads it is.
SPIKE,"??? (sorry, can't make out this line)"
SPIKE,"Hey, get away from her!"
DAWN,"Spike, come on!"
SPIKE,That's it.
SPIKE,"Leave it, Dawn."
DAWN,I can't. Mom.
SPIKE,It's too dangerous and I haven't got-
SPIKE,-a weapon!
SPIKE,"No, that's it."
DAWN,Spike!
DAWN,Sorry!
SPIKE,Did you get it?
SPIKE,Don't be sorry then.
Cut to,"exterior Summers house, night."
DAWN VOICEOVER,Osiris... giver of darkness...
DAWN,"Taker of life ... god of gods... accept my offering. Bone, flesh, breath ..."
DAWN,Yours ... eternally.
DAWN VOICEOVER,Bone...
DAWN VOICEOVER,"Flesh, breath..."
DAWN VOICEOVER,I beg of you...
DAWN,...return to me.
WILLOW,What did I have for breakfast this morning? Do you remember?
TARA,Hmm?
WILLOW,"I-I wanna say bagel, but I think that was yesterday. You had two eggs sunny-side-up. (grins) I remember 'cause they were wiggling at me like little boobs."
TARA,(grins) Sassy eggs. (Willow continues writing) What are you writing this for?
WILLOW,My journal.
TARA,That's new.
WILLOW,"Yeah. I-I figured, life goes by so fast, if you don't write stuff down it just gets ... lost. And I wanna remember."
TARA,Down to every last bagel.
WILLOW,"(grins, looks Tara in the eye) Down to every last everything I do with you."
TARA,Huh.
WILLOW,(stops writing) What?
TARA,What happened to <I>History of Witchcraft</I>?
WILLOW,"I, uh, i-it isn't there?"
TARA,Dawn must have taken it.
WILLOW,(anxiously) No she didn't! Did she? (gets up and goes quickly toward Tara)
TARA,"This is bad, this is really bad."
WILLOW,"(anxiously) But, i-it's just a history book. I-it might answer some of her questions. I-I don't think she could do any ... harm with that stuff, could she?"
TARA,"Well, it's not a how-to guide, but it refers to specific resurrection spells and potions."
WILLOW,But I-I didn't ... I mean ... hey! How'd she know that?
TARA,"I-I don't know, but ... god, what else did she take?"
WILLOW,"Nothing! I-I think. I think n... she took nothing else. But maybe she did, and we should probably look. Because who knows? I-I don't."
TARA,"No, no, we can't waste time on that now. We don't know what she's up to."
WILLOW,(nodding) We have to call Buffy. Now.
BUFFY,Hello?
DAWN,"Bone ... flesh ... breath ... yours eternally. Bone, flesh, breath, I beg of you, return to me."
BUFFY,Dawn.
BUFFY,What have you done? (rushes over to Dawn) What have you done?
DAWN,(standing) She's coming. She's coming home.
BUFFY,Dawn! Dawn!
BUFFY,"You have no idea what you're messing with. Who knows what you actually raised, what's gonna come through that door!"
DAWN,"(tearful) No, I-I know. It'll be her."
BUFFY,"No. Now, Tara told me that these spells go bad all the time. People come back ... wrong."
DAWN,Not Mom. He told me her DNA-
BUFFY,(grabs Dawn by the upper arms) Who told you? Who helped you?
DAWN,"(angry) Nobody, let me go."
BUFFY,You have to stop it. Reverse it.
DAWN,No!
BUFFY,"Dawn, you know this is wrong. You know you can't let this happen. Not to Mom."
DAWN,(quietly) But I need her. I don't care if she...
Cut to,"shot of a pair of feet walking on grass. The feet are wearing pale blue pumps, and we can see the hem of a pale blue skirt."
DAWN VOICEOVER,"I'm not like you, Buffy."
DAWN,I don't have anybody.
BUFFY,What?! Of course you do. You have me!
DAWN,"No, I don't. You won't even look at me. It's so obvious you don't want me around."
BUFFY,That's not true.
DAWN,"(harshly) Yes it is. Mom ... died, and it's like you don't even care."
BUFFY,"(shocked, with tears in her eyes) Of course I care. How can you even think that?"
DAWN,How can I not? You haven't even cried. You've just been running around like it's been some big chore or something. Cleaning up after Mom's mess.
BUFFY,"(tearful) Dawn ... I've been ... working. I've been busy, because I have to-"
DAWN,(tearful) No! You've been avoiding me.
BUFFY,"I'm not! ... I have to do these things, 'cause ... (crying) 'cause when I stop, then she's really gone."
BUFFY,"And I'm trying. Dawn, I am, I am really trying to take care of things, but I don't even know what I'm doing. Mom always knew."
DAWN,Nobody's asking you to be Mom.
BUFFY,"Well, who's gonna be if I'm not? Huh, Dawn? Have you even thought about that? Who's gonna make things better? (crying harder) Who's gonna take care of us?"
DAWN,Buffy...
BUFFY,"I didn't mean to push you away, I didn't. I just, I couldn't let you see me."
BUFFY,"Oh god, Dawnie..."
BUFFY,(still crying) I don't know what we're gonna do. I'm scared.
DAWN,Buffy...
BUFFY,(small smile) Mommy?
DAWN,(alarmed) Buffy.
BUFFY,Mom.
BUFFY,(voice breaking) Dawn.
DAWN,It's okay.
DAWN,It's okay.
