<blockquote>GILES VOICEOVER,Previously...
ANYA,I think we screwed it up.
WILLOW,She's just ... disoriented from being tormented in some hell dimension.
SPIKE,That the kind of demon you are?
BUFFY,"I don't know why you can hit me, but I am not a demon."
BUFFY,"So you three have, what, banded together to be pains in my ass?"
WARREN,We're your arch-nemesises.
BUFFY,"Dawn, you need to eat something."
DAWN,Thanks for your concern.
WILLOW,Why is she taking it out on you?
TARA,I don't think this is gonna work.
WILLOW,Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
BUFFY,Willow has a problem.
WILLOW,No more spells. I'm finished.
SPIKE,I'm in love with you.
BUFFY,You're in love with pain.
SPIKE,You afraid I'm gonna-
SPIKE,Things have changed.
BUFFY,The only thing that's different is that I'm disgusted with myself.
BUFFY,(panting) Uh ... we missed the bed again.
SPIKE,(looks toward the bed) Lucky for the bed.
BUFFY,Is this a new rug?
SPIKE,Mm...no. Just looks different when you're under it.
BUFFY,"You know, this place is okay for a hole in the ground. You fixed it up."
SPIKE,"Well, I ate a decorator once. Maybe something stuck."
BUFFY,I've been thinking about doing something to my room.
SPIKE,(moving closer to her) Yeah?
BUFFY,"Yeah, I think the New Kids On The Block posters are starting to date me."
SPIKE,"(chuckles) Well, if you want, I can..."
SPIKE,Are we having a conversation?
BUFFY,What? No! No. (pause) Maybe.
SPIKE,Hmm.
BUFFY,What?
SPIKE,"Well, isn't this usually the part where you ... kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?"
BUFFY,That's the plan ... (embarrassed) ...soon as my legs start working.
SPIKE,(whispers) You were amazing.
BUFFY,(softly) You got the job done yourself.
SPIKE,I was just trying to keep up. The things you do ... (Buffy looks embarrassed. Spike smirks) ...the way you make it hurt in all the wrong places. I've never been with such an animal.
BUFFY,I'm not an animal.
SPIKE,You wanna see the bite marks?
BUFFY,"You know, it's late, I-I should ... get home before Dawn goes to sleep."
SPIKE,And she's off.
BUFFY,(muffled) Have you seen my underwear?
SPIKE,(sighs) What is this to you? This thing we have.
BUFFY,"(muffled) We don't have a ... thing, we have ... this. (head reappears) That's all."
SPIKE,Do you even like me?
BUFFY,(softly) Sometimes. (looks away)
SPIKE,But you like what I do to you.
SPIKE,Do you trust me?
BUFFY,Never.
Cut to a basement somewhere. Jonathan and Andrew stand looking at a bunch of boxes on a table. Jonathan pulls out a record,"""Frampton Comes Alive!"""
ANDREW,How can I trust you not to touch my stuff?
ANDREW,Actually living with supervillains was not part of the deal.
JONATHAN,"(looking in the boxes) We're on the lam, moron, it's not like we have a choice."
ANDREW,This sucks. Couldn't we have at least gotten a lair with a view?
JONATHAN,(removes his magic bone from a box) Stop whining! Get your sissy crap out of the way.
ANDREW,"Hey, quit it!"
ANDREW,Don't you curse me! (grabs for the bone)
JONATHAN,"Hey, my bone!"
ANDREW,Ow!
WARREN,Hey!
WARREN,"When you girls are done touching each other, the cerebral dampener's ready to be charged."
ANDREW,Cool.
JONATHAN,Got the thing?
ANDREW,(takes out a plastic baggie) Musk gland of a Homja-Maleev demon.
ANDREW,(strained) Fresh.
JONATHAN,All right. Stand back.
JONATHAN,"<I>Doma voluntatem, libera cupidinem, erumpe, ignem, excita.</I>"
JONATHAN,Okay ... ow!
WARREN,"Gentlemen, the cerebral dampener ... is online. (removes his glasses) And with this baby, we can make any woman we desire our willing sex slave."
WARREN,(grinning) I know just where to start.
BUFFY,Double meat is double sweet. Enjoy!
CUSTOMER,Thank you.
BUFFY,(defensive) Just something I'm trying.
TARA,"Hey, sorry I'm late."
BUFFY,"Oh, time has no meaning here. Gina, I'm taking a break."
Pan over to Tara sitting in a chair at a long table. Behind her we see more posters,"""Cooperation"" and ""Motivation."""
TARA,I have this sudden urge to dedicate my productive cooperation.
BUFFY,"Well, if you close your eyes and repeatedly smash yourself in the head with frozen meat, it'll go away. (sits) Eventually. I'm hoping."
BUFFY,Thanks for coming by.
TARA,(worried) Is it bad?
BUFFY,I was sort of hoping you could tell me.
TARA,I knew this was gonna happen. What did Willow do now? Did she ... she hurt anyone?
BUFFY,"Wha... uh, no, no, um... Ta-Tara, this isn't about Willow."
TARA,I-I thought that's why you didn't want to meet at the house.
BUFFY,"Uh, sorry, it's, um ... Willow's fine, uh, she, she's been doing really well. You'd be proud of her."
TARA,"Good, that's ... that's good. (pause) So, so what do you want to talk about?"
BUFFY,I-it's Spike. (Tara looking confused) He can hurt me.
BUFFY,Without his head exploding.
TARA,Oh my god. Hi-his chip stopped working?
BUFFY,"No, it still works. Just not on me. (nervous) I-I need to know about the spell. The one that ... brought me back. I, I'd ask Willow, but..."
TARA,(getting it) You think it's you.
BUFFY,I don't know. I feel ... different. There are things...
BUFFY,I-I think ... maybe ... I came back wrong.
TARA,"(firmly) No, Buffy, that's n-not ... no. You didn't."
BUFFY,Can you check out the spell? Just see if there's something that ... Could you just check? Please?
Cut to,"exterior city street, night. The Geek Trio's van is parked at the edge of an alley."
JONATHAN,(OS) Right there! That's got it.
JONATHAN,Mad Dog Two to Mad Dog One.
ANDREW,I thought I was Mad Dog Two.
JONATHAN,Mad Dog *Three* to Mad Dog One.
Cut to,"interior of the restaurant. Warren stands by the door, wearing a suit and tie."
JONATHAN VOICEOVER,(over earpiece) Signal's coming in strong and clear. Over.
WARREN,(puts a hand to his ear) Roger that. Beginning preliminary sweep.
WARREN,(quietly) Keep your potatoes peeled for the Slayer. I don't want any surprises.
ANDREW,We can really have anyone we want.
JONATHAN,It's like candy.
ANDREW,"Juicy, pulsating candy."
JONATHAN,"Oh! Oh, the one with the neck! Put the whammy on the neck!"
ANDREW,No! The redhead! I want the redhead!
JONATHAN,(over earpiece) The redhead's too tall.
ANDREW,"(over earpiece) So get a step ladder. No, no, ow!"
ANDREW,(over earpiece) Get off of me!
JONATHAN,(over earpiece) Take it back!
WARREN,(smiling) Target acquired.
JONATHAN,What?
WARREN,Initiating contact. (begins walking forward)
JONATHAN,The brunette?
ANDREW,"Oh, she's kinda cute -- (Jonathan tightens his hold) Ow! (looking up at the screen) Oh, no, go for the leather skirt!"
ANDREW,"Oh, bazoombas!"
ANDREW,(over earpiece) Go for the one with the bazoombas!
JONATHAN,"(over earpiece) Yeah, go for the one with the bazoombas."
WARREN,So how did you get so beautiful?
KATRINA,"Okay, does that line usually work...?"
KATRINA,What the hell are you doing here?
WARREN,"It's nice to see you again too, Katrina."
KATRINA,"Yeah, it's the seeing you part that's throwing me here, Warren, because I thought I was pretty clear with the never wanting that to happen again."
WARREN,"Never's a long time, baby."
KATRINA,Apparently not long enough.
WARREN,"Oh, you're not still sore about that thing, are you?"
KATRINA,"What *thing* would that be exactly? What, the wind-up slut you tinkered together? Or when Little Miss Nuts and Bolts tried to choke me to death?"
WARREN,"Okay, so I've made a few mistakes."
KATRINA,"No. No, I did. For ever lowering myself to be with a jerk like you."
WARREN,Don't say that.
KATRINA,"Well, what did you expect, to just ... waltz in here and sweep me off my feet with your cheesy lines and fancy suit?"
WARREN,"No, I ju- I just thought ... we could talk. I thought maybe we could work things out."
KATRINA,There's nothing to work out. What you did was sick. And just looking at you makes me want to vomit. (gathering up her purse)
WARREN,(reaching into his jacket pocket) You sure about that? (puts on his red sunglasses)
KATRINA,"Yes, god yes, I'm sure."
KATRINA,"I love you, Master."
WARREN,"I love you, too, baby."
Cut to,"interior Summers house, night. Angle on the front door from the living room. Soft music. Buffy enters from outside."
BUFFY,(calls) I'm home! Who wants to help scrape the grease off my...
BUFFY,(horrified) Is there singing?!
BUFFY,Are we singing again?
XANDER,"Nope, just the dancing."
ANYA,We're teaching Dawn perfectly synchronized dance steps for the wedding reception.
XANDER,(to Buffy) Wanna go for a spin?
BUFFY,"Uh, think I'm heading more towards an ungainly collapse."
WILLOW,"Aw, rough day?"
BUFFY,Kinda.
XANDER,"You've been going at it too hard, Buffy. We hardly ever see you, what with slinging the double meat and pounding the big evil."
ANYA,You are looking a little pounded. (Buffy looks insulted) Just around the eyes.
WILLOW,"Hey, we're thinking of heading to the Bronze later. Wanna come, get all unwindy?"
XANDER,Tall glasses of frosty relaxation on me. Nectar of the working man.
BUFFY,"No, thanks. I think I'll stay here with Dawn. (Sound of a car horn honking outside) Curl up on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and-"
BUFFY,...listen to the cars honk? (to Dawn) Where are you going?
DAWN,I'm ... sleeping over at Janice's?
BUFFY,And I'm falling for that again because of the surprise lobotomy?
WILLOW,"It's okay, I checked it out. Janice's mom is picking her up."
BUFFY,Oh.
DAWN,"I didn't think you'd care. You're never home, so..."
BUFFY,"I know. I'm sorry. You know, but I, I'm here now. All visible and everything. Couldn't you just stay at Janice's another night?"
DAWN,Her mom's cooking Mexican. She's gonna teach me how to make real tortillas. (softly) Not like I knew you'd be around.
BUFFY,Frosty nectar. Now please.
Cut to,close shot on Warren in the new geek lair. He holds up a glass that is being filled.
WARREN,"Thank you, baby."
KATRINA,"My pleasure, Master."
ANDREW,That is so cool.
JONATHAN,I really could've used one of these in high school.
WARREN,Gentlemen? To crime.
ANDREW/JONATHAN,Crime!
ANDREW,Crime tastes funny.
JONATHAN,"Wow. (circling around Katrina, checking her out) I still think I would have gone with the bazoombas, but..."
JONATHAN,...wow.
ANDREW,"Yeah, she's ... really cute."
WARREN,(offended) Cute?
WARREN,"Look at her, man! The (pointing) the shape of her lips. The smooth, silky skin. The way her nose- (goofy laugh) the way her nose crinkles when she laughs... (softly) She's perfect."
JONATHAN,Yeah.
ANDREW,She's totally hot.
KATRINA,"(still staring ahead blankly) So are you, Master."
ANDREW,(surprised) You think so?
KATRINA,"Oh yes, Master."
JONATHAN,Okay ... so ... how do we ... you know.
ANDREW,Who gets to...
WARREN,I do.
ANDREW,That's not fair.
JONATHAN,"Dude, you didn't call it."
WARREN,"Oh, I don't have to call it, Sparky. She's mine. But don't worry. (takes the champagne bottle from Katrina and gives it to Jonathan) You can play with her all you want ... after I'm done with her."
Cut to another room. It's very red,"red sheets on the bed, red lava lamp, red wall-coverings."
WARREN,I missed you so much. You never should have left me. (kiss) Say it.
KATRINA,"(mechanically) I never should have left you, Master. (more kissing)"
WARREN,Tell me you love me.
KATRINA,"I love you, Master."
WARREN,Again.
KATRINA,"I love you, Master. (more kissing)"
WARREN,"I love you too, baby. (shrugs) Get on your knees."
KATRINA,"Yes, Warren."
WARREN,"Wait, what'd you just say?"
KATRINA,"I said yes, War-"
KATRINA,What the f-
KATRINA,(furious) What did you do to me?!
WARREN,Get the Dampener!
KATRINA,Who the hell are you?
ANDREW,"Um, your masters?"
KATRINA,My what?!
JONATHAN,Where'd you put it?!
ANDREW,You had it last!
KATRINA,Are you kidding me?!
WARREN,Get the Dampener!
KATRINA,You were gonna share me with these two dorks?! (Warren putting on his red sunglasses)
ANDREW,Hey! We're supervillains!
ANDREW,"Call us ""Master!"""
JONATHAN,Wait!
ANDREW,"Aw, crap."
JONATHAN,It's out of juice!
KATRINA,(to Warren) Is that what you used on me?! Oh my god! First the skankbot and now this?! What is wrong with you!
WARREN,"I just, I wanted us to be together!"
KATRINA,"There is no us, Warren! Get that through your big meaty head! I am not your girlfriend anymore!"
JONATHAN,She's your ex?
ANDREW,"Dude, that is messed up."
KATRINA,"Oh, you think? (walking toward the other two) You bunch of little boys, playing at being men. (yelling) Well, this is not some fantasy, it's not a game, you freaks! It's rape!"
JONATHAN,(stunned) What?
ANDREW,No ... we didn't-
KATRINA,"(crying, and still angry) You're all sick. (points at Warren) And I'm going to make sure you get locked up for this. And then we'll see how you like getting raped."
WARREN,Stop her!
KATRINA,Get off me!
WARREN,Charge the Cerebral Dampener.
JONATHAN,(shaking his head) Warren...
WARREN,Charge the Dampener! Andrew ... get her up.
WARREN,We'll give her another dose. (wiping his mouth with his sleeve) A strong one.
WARREN,Everything's all right. Everything's ... gonna be all right.
ANDREW,I don't think so.
ANDREW,She's dead.
ANDREW,"Oh god, oh god, oh god."
WARREN,Her neck. It just... (looks back at Jonathan)
JONATHAN,"(shaking his head) No, that's ... not..."
JONATHAN,This isn't happening.
WARREN,"I just, I gotta ... I gotta, lemme think."
JONATHAN,(tearful) What did you do? What the hell did you do?!
WARREN,"*We* did this. Me, and Andrew, and you. It's on all of us."
ANDREW,...oh god oh god oh god...
WARREN,Shut up!
WARREN,"(lets go of Jonathan) We, uh, we have to get ... we have to get r-rid of it."
JONATHAN,How?
WARREN,"Uh, uh, may-maybe a spell. Can you teleport it out of here?"
JONATHAN,"(looking at the body) No, she's ... (upset) It's too big."
WARREN,Andrew.
WARREN,Andrew!
ANDREW,What?
WARREN,"Is there any ... thing that you can, uh, summon, something that... (winces, wipes his mouth) something that can devour that much?"
ANDREW,"Maybe a Jarvlen Flesh Eater, but ... they're hard to control. It'd go for us, too."
JONATHAN,"(upset) Oh, well that's it, man. We're screwed."
WARREN,"No, we just have to stay calm."
JONATHAN,Tell that to your girlfriend!
WARREN,Ex-girlfriend!
JONATHAN,"It doesn't matter! There's a link. You knew her, so there's a link. You don't think Buffy'll be able to put that together? That's what she does, she'll figure it out!"
ANDREW,It was an accident. Maybe if we turn ourselves in-
WARREN,No.
JONATHAN,He's right. If we go to the police now-
WARREN,I'm not going to jail.
JONATHAN,"We can't hide this! Sooner or later, the Slayer's gonna find out she's dead."
WARREN,"(rubbing his chin, thoughtfully) Well, then maybe it should be sooner."
JONATHAN,Are you insane?
WARREN,Listen to me.
JONATHAN,No!
WARREN,"Listen! (more quietly) We have two problems. The body, and the Slayer. Well, what if there was a way that we could take care of them both ... with one big stone."
WILLOW VOICEOVER,What are they doing?
WILLOW,"We're not going to have to do that at the wedding, are we? 'Cause there's this last thread of dignity I've been desperately clinging to."
BUFFY,"You're still doing okay, right?"
WILLOW,"Yeah. You know. Some days are harder than the really hard days. It's easier like this, though, when I'm not alone."
BUFFY,(contrite) I'm sorry I haven't been around that much.
WILLOW,"No, that's not -- it's okay. We know you've been all tied up."
BUFFY,What?
WILLOW,"With your job, and the slaying."
XANDER,"Hey, I see sitting where there should be dancing."
ANYA,Come share in the joy of our groove thang.
WILLOW,"And despite that, I succumb to the beat. (getting up)"
BUFFY,I think I'll catch the next Soul Train out.
XANDER,You sure?
BUFFY,"Oh, yeah, you know, (holding up her empty plastic cup) glass all the way empty. More nectar required."
XANDER,"Cool, well, shimmy on out when you're done lubricating."
SPIKE,(O.S.) You see ... you try to be with them...
SPIKE,...but you always end up in the dark ... (whispering in her ear) ...with me.
SPIKE,What would they think of you ... if they found out ... all the things you've done?
SPIKE,If they knew ... who you really were?
BUFFY,(whispers) Don't.
SPIKE,Stop me.
SPIKE,No ... don't close your eyes.
SPIKE,Look at them.
SPIKE,That's not your world. You belong in the shadows... with me.
SPIKE,Look at your friends ... and tell me ... you don't love getting away with this... (Buffy still watching her friends) ...right under their noses.
Cut to,"street scene, day. Xander and Willow walking past the coffee-shop and toward the Magic Box. Xander groans and limps."
XANDER,Oh! I think I pulled a jive muscle last night.
WILLOW,(chuckles) The Funky Monkey claims another victim.
WILLOW,"(surprised) Tara. What are you doing here? I mean ... uh, it's okay for you to be here if you have things that ... you have to be here for."
XANDER,"Yeah, I'm gonna go bring Anya up to speed on that monkey situation."
TARA,(to Willow) There's a monkey problem?
WILLOW,Only if you don't stretch first. (looking at Tara's book) The <I>Brekenkrieg Grimoire</I>? Light reading?
TARA,"Uh, yeah, I was just..."
WILLOW,"No, it's okay. I, I didn't expect you to stop doing magic just because ... You don't have to hide it. I'm not - I'm, I'm doing better. No spells for thirty-two days. (Tara smiles) I can even go to the magic shop now. As long as someone's with me at all times. But, uh, but it's better now, it really is. You know, if you were checking on me."
TARA,"No, I wouldn't ... I was just looking for Buffy."
WILLOW,"Oh. Well, I-I haven't seen her since last night. She's not around much these days. We kinda miss her."
TARA,"I'm sure she feels the same way. If you see her, c-can you tell her that I need to talk to her? It's important."
WILLOW,Yeah. Of course I will.
TARA,Thanks.
TARA,Will? I'm ... I'm glad you're doing better.
Cut to,"graveyard, night. Buffy walks along, holding a stake. She wears a brown turtleneck sweater, a black jacket, and black leather gloves."
BUFFY,(to herself) Don't think about the evil bloodsucking fiend. Focus on anything but the evil bloodsucking fiend.
BUFFY,Thank you!
BUFFY,Huh?
BUFFY,"It's okay. I'm going to get you out of here. Can, can you walk? Are you hurt?"
CREEPY VOICES,What did you do? What did you do? Buffy... Buffy...
SPIKE,(OS) Ow!
SPIKE,"Bloody hell, what'd you do that for?"
BUFFY,(confused) Spike?
SPIKE,Buffy!
BUFFY,Spike. What's happening?
SPIKE,"So you thought you could just slip away, then? Vampire, remember?"
SPIKE,I could feel you.
Whooshing noise. Scene change,"we're back in the demon fight again. Buffy blocks a punch, punches a demon and continues fighting him."
SPIKE,"Ow! Bloody hell, what'd you do that for?"
SPIKE,Buffy!
SPIKE,Buffy!
SPIKE,Do you mind?
SPIKE,Buffy?
BUFFY,She's dead.
BUFFY,I killed her.
SPIKE,We have to go.
BUFFY,(to herself) What happened? (Shot of Katrina's dead body)
SPIKE,There's nothing you can do now. We have to go before someone sees you.
BUFFY,(whispering in horror) What did I do?
SPIKE,"We have to go, now!"
SPIKE,All right. Listen to me. Buffy. (shakes her) Buffy!
BUFFY,She's dead.
SPIKE,It was an accident.
BUFFY,I killed her.
SPIKE,I'm gonna get you home.
BUFFY,No!
SPIKE,"(firmly) I'm gonna get you home, and you're gonna crawl in your warm comfy bed and stay there! (softer) We're gonna sort this out. Trust me."
WARREN,(O.S.) Two problems...
WARREN,...one stone.
WARREN,Nice job. She totally bought it.
KATRINA,(sarcastic) Yeah.
JONATHAN,(sarcastic) Some of my best work.
ANDREW,What happens now?
JONATHAN,"(bitterly) Well, the night's young. Gotta be some more girls we could kill."
WARREN,"We stick to the plan! Buffy thinks she killed Katrina. Well, it's her problem now."
CREEPY VOICES,(whispering) What did you do... Buffy... What did you do...
SPIKE,"(O.S.) It's all right, luv."
SPIKE,"Shh, it's all right. It'll be our little secret."
Cut to,"Spike's crypt. Shot of Buffy's head and bare shoulders, sitting up, eyes closed in pleasure, moving rhythmically. She opens her eyes and looks down."
BUFFY,Do you trust me?
BUFFY,Hey.
DAWN,(sleepy) What time is it?
BUFFY,It's late. I just wanted...
BUFFY,"I love you. You know that, right?"
DAWN,What's wrong?
BUFFY,I know I haven't been everything I should be ... everything Mom was... (Dawn still looking scared) ...but I love you. (tearful) I always will.
DAWN,Why are you talking like this? Buffy?
BUFFY,There was an accident. In the woods. A girl ... she was hurt. I hurt someone.
DAWN,Oh my god. Is she all right?
BUFFY,(almost crying) No.
BUFFY,I'm sorry.
BUFFY,There's something I have to do. I have to tell what I did. I have to go to the police.
DAWN,(pulls back from the hug) The police?
BUFFY,"Dawnie, I have to."
DAWN,But ... what's going to happen?
BUFFY,I don't know.
DAWN,(upset) They'll take you away. Won't they.
BUFFY,I'm sorry. (looks down)
DAWN,"No, you're not. (Buffy looking surprised) You're never here. You can't even stand to be around me."
BUFFY,That is not true.
DAWN,(almost crying) You don't want to be here with me. You didn't want to come back. I know that. You were happier where you were. (crying) You want to go away again.
BUFFY,Dawn...
DAWN,Then go! You're not really here anyway.
Cut to,"exterior police station, night. Cop cars parked out front, various officers going in and out."
SPIKE,(O.S.) What do you think you're doing?
BUFFY,(keeps walking) The right thing. For once.
SPIKE,"Sorry, luv. (Buffy getting up) Can't let you do that."
BUFFY,I have to tell them what happened.
SPIKE,Nothing happened.
BUFFY,(surprised) I killed that girl.
SPIKE,Demons in the woods? Time going wonky? They won't believe you.
BUFFY,I'll show them.
SPIKE,(coolly) Show them what?
BUFFY,What did you do?
SPIKE,I took care of it.
BUFFY,(very angry) What ... did you do?!
SPIKE,(firmly) What I had to. I went back and I took care of it. It doesn't matter now. No one will ever find her.
COP #1,(O.S.) Where'd they find her?
COP #2,The river. She washed up half a mile from the cemetery.
SPIKE,Oh ... balls.
SPIKE,There still isn't anything to connect this to you.
BUFFY,It doesn't matter.
SPIKE,It wasn't your fault!
BUFFY,I killed her!
SPIKE,It was an accident. It just happened.
BUFFY,Nothing just happens.
SPIKE,You're not going in there.
BUFFY,I have to do this. Just let me go.
SPIKE,I can't. I love you.
BUFFY,"(upset) No, you don't."
SPIKE,(harshly) You think I haven't tried not to?
BUFFY,Try harder.
SPIKE,You are not throwing your life away over this.
BUFFY,It's not your choice.
SPIKE,Why are you doing this to yourself?
BUFFY,(tearful) A girl is dead because of me.
SPIKE,And how many people are alive because of you? How many have you saved? One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.
BUFFY,"That's all it is to you, isn't it? Just another body!"
SPIKE,(sighing) Buffy-
BUFFY,"You can't understand why this is killing me, can you?"
SPIKE,Why don't you explain it?
SPIKE,"Come on, that's it, put it on me. Put it all on me. (She kicks him) That's my girl."
BUFFY,(yelling) I am not your girl!
BUFFY,You don't ... have a soul! There is nothing good or clean in you. You are dead inside! You can't feel anything real! I could never ... be your girl!
SPIKE,"(slurred) You always hurt ... the one you love, pet."
SPIKE,Buffy?
SPIKE,Buffy...
Cut to,"interior police station. Buffy walks in, looks around. Various officers and other people walking around, sitting, etc. Buffy pauses, sees the front desk, walks toward it. We see the desk sergeant talking on the phone."
DESK SERGEANT,"(into phone) No, no statements. Not until I get confirmation."
BUFFY,(timidly) Excuse me. I-I need to...
DESK SERGEANT,"Uh, I'll be with you in a sec."
DESK SERGEANT,"(into phone) Sunnydale PD. Yeah, the phone's ringing off the hook here."
DESK SERGEANT,"Listen, you got an ID on that body yet? (Buffy closes her eyes in pain) Yeah? Okay, shoot."
DESK SERGEANT,Katrina ... Silber. S-i-l-b-e-r.
KATRINA VOICEOVER,"Warren, just tell her to go away."
WARREN VOICEOVER,I can't.
KATRINA,"You're keeping secrets from me. Other girls, and who knows what else!"
WARREN,Trina ... shut up.
BUFFY,(to herself) Warren.
DESK SERGEANT,"(into phone) Thanks. (hangs up) Now what's the problem, Miss..."
Cut to,"magic shop, day. Close on an open book showing a drawing of one of the demons from the forest."
ANYA,(OS) Is this what you saw?
BUFFY,"Yeah, that's it."
ANYA,"Mm. The Rwasundi. Very rare. Um, its presence in our dimension causes a sort of ... localized temporal disturbance."
BUFFY,So that's why time went all David Lynch?
ANYA,"Right. Uh, human perception is based on a linear chronology. Being exposed to the Rwasundi for more than a few seconds can cause, uh, vivid hallucinations. And a slight tingly scalp. (sits)"
WILLOW,So that's it. These things just made you think you killed her.
XANDER,She was probably dead long before you stumbled across her.
BUFFY,"It wasn't the demons. It was Warren. He knew Katrina. He had something to do with it, I know it."
WILLOW,How can you be sure?
BUFFY,You always hurt the one you love.
DAWN,"(sullen, not looking at Buffy) Does this mean you're not going away?"
BUFFY,Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.
BUFFY,"We need to find Warren, and the others. Whatever they've done, they're not gonna get away with it."
WARREN,"We're gonna get away with it. (pointing at screen) ""Injuries consistent with a fall."""
Close on the screen. It reads in part,
Ruling,<font color=red>SUICIDE</font>
<font size=-1>Coroner,Willard Batts</font>
WARREN,The coroner's ruling it a suicide.
JONATHAN,What about Buffy?
WARREN,"Well, it wasn't that hard messing her game up. If she figures it out ... we'll take care of her."
ANDREW,We really got away with murder.
ANDREW,That's ... kinda cool.
JONATHAN,(weakly) Yeah. Cool.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,Are you sure?
TARA,I-I've double checked everything. (smiling) There's nothing wrong with you.
BUFFY,Then why can Spike hurt me?
TARA,"Well, I said that there was nothing wrong with you, but ... you are different. Shifting you out of ... f-f-from where you were ... funneling your essence back into your body ... i-it, it altered you on a basic molecular level. Probably just enough to confuse the sensors or whatever in Spike's chip. But it's all just surfacey physical stuff. It wouldn't have any more effect than ... a bad sunburn."
BUFFY,I didn't come back wrong?
TARA,"No, you're the same Buffy. (lightly) With a deep tropical cellular tan."
BUFFY,You must have missed something. Will you check again?
TARA,"(concerned) Buffy, I-I promise, there's nothing wrong with you."
BUFFY,"There has to be! This just can't be me, it isn't me. (starting to cry) Why do I feel like this? Why do I let Spike do those things to me?"
TARA,You mean hit you.
TARA,Oh.
TARA,"Oh, huh. Really."
BUFFY,"He's everything I hate. He's everything that ... I'm supposed to be against. But the only time that I ever feel anything is when ... Don't tell anyone, please."
TARA,I won't.
BUFFY,(crying) The way they would look at me ... I just couldn't...
TARA,I won't tell anyone. I wouldn't do that.
BUFFY,(whispers) Why can't I stop? Why do I keep letting him in?
TARA,(concerned) Do you love him?
TARA,"I-It's okay if you do. He's done a lot of good, and, and he does love you. A-and Buffy, it's okay if you don't. You're going through a really hard time, and you're..."
BUFFY,(still tearful) What? Using him? What's okay about that?
TARA,It's not that simple.
BUFFY,"It is! It's wrong. I'm wrong. Tell me that I'm wrong, please..."
BUFFY,"Please don't forgive me, please... (sobbing) Please don't..."
BUFFY,"(sobbing, muffled) Please don't forgive me..."
