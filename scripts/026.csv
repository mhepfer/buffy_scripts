character,dialogue
Spike,"I'm not happy, pet. Angel and the Slayer are still alive. They  know where we are, they know about the Judge. We should be vacating."
Drusilla,(walks up to him) Nonsense. (takes his hand) They'll not  disturb us here. My Angel's too smart to face the Judge again.
Spike,(glances over his shoulder) What's Big Blue up to anyway? He  just sits there. (looks away)
Judge,I am preparing.
Spike,(rolls his eyes) Yeah. (turns and wheels over to him) It's  interesting to me that 'preparing' looks a great bit like sitting on  your ass. (facing him) When do we destroy the world already?
Judge,"My strength grows, and with every life I take it will increase  further."
Spike,So let's take some. I'm bored.
Spike,(looks back at her) Dru?
Drusilla,Angel...
Spike,(concerned) Dru? (rolls to her) What is it? (stops by her) Dru!
Spike,Darling... Do you see something?
Buffy,Angel?
Angel,Buffy...
Angel,"(frightened) Oh, no."
Hooker,Hey. You okay? (bends down to look at him) You want me to call  911?
Angel,(suddenly stands up) No. The pain is gone.
Hooker,You sure?
Angel,Yeah.
Angelus,I feel just fine.
Joyce,(off camera) Morning.
Buffy,Morning.
Joyce,"So, did you have fun last night?"
Buffy,Fun?
Joyce,At Willow's.
Buffy,"Yeah. (smiles) Yeah, fun at Willow's. You know, she's a fun  machine."
Joyce,You hungry?
Buffy,"No. Uh, no, I-I'm, uh, just gonna go take a shower."
Joyce,"Well, i-if you hurry, I'll run you to school."
Buffy,Thanks.
Joyce,Is something wrong?
Buffy,No. (shakes her head) What would be wrong?
Joyce,(staring) I don't know. You just look...
Xander,"Well, the bus depot was a total washout. And may I say what a  lovely place to spend the night. What a vibrant cross-section of  Americana."
Giles,No vampires transporting boxes?
Xander,"No, but a four-hundred-pound wino offered to wash my hair.  (looks at everyone) What's up? Where's Buffy?"
Willow,She never checked in.
Giles,If the bus depot is as empty as the... docks and the airport...
Xander,Do you think this Judge guy's already been assembled?
Giles,Yes.
Xander,"Then Buffy could be... Okay, we gotta find 'em. (thinks) Um, we  gotta go to that place, that, uh, that factory. That's where they're  holed up, right? (looks back at Willow and Jenny) Let's go."
Cordelia,And do what? Besides be afraid and die.
Xander,"Well, nobody's asking you to go, Cordelia. If the vampires need  grooming tips we'll give you a call."
Giles,"Cordelia has a point. Now, i-i-if Buffy and Angel were, were...  harmed, then we don't stand to fare much better."
Xander,"Yeah? Well, those of us who were born with feelings are gonna  do something about this."
Jenny,Xander.
Willow,"No, Xander's right! My God, you people are all... Well, I'm  upset, and I can't think of a mean word right now, but that's what you  are, and we're going to the factory! (starts out)"
Xander,Yeah! (follows)
Willow,Buffy!
Xander,We were just going to rescue you.
Willow,"(throws Giles a look) Well, some of us were."
Giles,"Well, I-I would have."
Jenny,Where's Angel?
Buffy,He didn't check in with you guys?
Giles,No.
Cordelia,(slides off the counter) What happened?
Giles,"The Judge, i-is he..."
Buffy,No assembly required. He's active.
Giles,"(whispers) Oh, damn it. (removes his glasses)"
Buffy,He nearly killed us. Angel got us out.
Giles,"Why didn't you call? We, we, we thought..."
Buffy,"Well, we, we had to hide. Uh, we got stuck in the sewer tunnels,  and with the hiding, we just split up... Uh, no one's heard from him?"
Willow,I'm sure he'll come by.
Buffy,"Yeah, I'm, I'm sure you're right."
Giles,"Buffy, the Judge, we, we must stop him."
Buffy,I know.
Giles,What can you tell us?
Buffy,"Not much. I, um... I kicked him. It was just like a sudden  fever. If he'd got his hands on me..."
Giles,"In time, he won't need to. The stronger he gets, he'll be able  to reduce us to charcoal with a look."
Buffy,"Also, not the prettiest man in town."
Giles,"I better continue researching, must look for a weak spot. The  rest of you should get to your classes."
Jenny,"Yeah, I better go, too."
Xander,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. (holds the door open)"
Willow,"Buffy, wait up!"
Jenny,"(stops on the way out) (to Giles) I'll, uh, go on the 'Net and  search for anything on the Judge."
Giles,Thank you.
Xander,After classes I'll come back and help you research.
Cordelia,"(pats him as she walks out) Yeah, you might find something  useful if it's in an 'I Can Read' book."
Willow,"You don't think Angel would have gone after the Judge himself,  do you?"
Buffy,"No, he'd know better than that. Maybe he just needed... I don't  know. I just, I wish he'd contact me. I need to talk to him."
Spike,"(smiles) Are we feeling better, then? (leans on the table)"
Drusilla,(sighs) I'm naming all the stars.
Spike,"You can't see the stars, love. That's the ceiling. Also, it's  day."
Drusilla,I can see them. But I've named them all the same name. (tilts  her head to him) And there's terrible confusion.
Spike,Did you see any further? Do you know what happens to Angel?
Angelus,"(appears at a side door) Well, (clears his throat) he moves to  New York and tries to fulfill that Broadway dream. It's tough sledding,  but one day he's working in the chorus when the big star twists her  ankle."
Spike,"You don't give up, do you?"
Angelus,"(slowly comes over) As long as there's injustice in the world,  as long as scum like you is walking... (notices the wheelchair) well,  rolling the streets... I'll be around. (stops a few feet away) Look over  your shoulder. I'll be there."
Spike,"Uh, yeah. Angel, um... look over *your* shoulder."
Spike,"Hurts, doesn't it?"
Angelus,"(looks back) Well, you know, it kinda itches a little."
Spike,(to the Judge) Don't just stand there. Burn him.
Angelus,"Gee, maybe he's broken."
Spike,(to Drusilla) What the hell is going on?
Judge,This one... cannot be burnt. He is clean. (removes his hand)
Spike,"Clean? You mean, he's..."
Judge,There's no humanity in him. (turns and goes)
Angelus,(faces Spike) I couldn't have said it better myself.
Drusilla,Angel.
Angelus,"Yeah, baby. I'm back."
Spike,Is it really true?
Angelus,It's really true. (laughs and walks around the table)
Drusilla,(follows him with her gaze) You've come home.
Spike,No more of this 'I've got a soul' crap? (follows him)
Angelus,"What can I say, hmm? (strikes a match on the table) I was  going through a phase. (lights a cigarette)"
Spike,This is great! This is so great!
Drusilla,(walks on the table waving her arms) Everything in my head is  singing! (Angelus laughs) We're family again. (Angelus helps her off of  the table) We'll feed. Grrr. (turns to Spike) And we'll play. (leans in  to him)
Spike,"I've got to tell you, it made me sick to my stomach seeing you  being the Slayer's lap dog."
Drusilla,How did this happen?
Angelus,You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Spike,"Oh, who cares? What matters is now he's back! Now it's four  against one, which are the kind of odds I like to play."
Drusilla,(leans toward Angelus) Psst. We're going to destroy the  world. Want to come?
Angelus,(plays with his cigarette) Yeah. Destroying the world. Great.  I'm really more interested in the Slayer.
Spike,"Well, she's *in* the world, so that should work out."
Angelus,Give me tonight. Hmm?
Spike,What do you mean?
Angelus,Lay low for a night. I guarantee you by the time you go public  she won't be anything resembling a threat.
Spike,"You've really got a yen to hurt this girl, haven't you?"
Angelus,She made me feel like a human being. That's not the kind of  thing you just forgive.
Willow,"Ok. No, no, he didn't, but I'm sure he'll... Well, Buffy, he  probably has some plan, and he's trying to protect you. Well, I-I don't  know what. I'm not in on the plan. It's his plan. No. Don't even say  that! Angel is not dead."
Xander,Say 'hi' for me.
Willow,"(into the phone) Yeah, of course we'll be here. Okay, bye.  (hangs up) (to Xander) Say 'hi' for me?"
Xander,What's the word?
Willow,She's checked every place she can think of. She even beat up  Willy the snitch a couple of times. Angel's vanished.
Giles,"(standing in his doorway) But he does do that on occasion, no?"
Willow,"Oh, yeah, but she's extra wigged this time. I guess 'cause of  her dreams. God, what if something really happened to him?"
Giles,Is she gonna join us here?
Willow,Yeah. She's just stopping at home first.
Xander,Nada.
Xander,Did you find anything? (shelves the book)
Cordelia,"This book mentions the Judge, but nothing useful. Big, scary,  no weapon forged can stop him, took an army to take him down. Blah,  blah, blah."
Xander,"We need some insight, a weak spot."
Cordelia,"Well, we're not gonna find it here."
Xander,Sorry I snapped at you before.
Cordelia,"Well, I'm reeling from that new experience."
Xander,I was crazed. I wasn't thinking.
Cordelia,I know. You were too busy rushing off to die for your beloved  Buffy. You'd never die for me.
Xander,"No, I might die *from* you. Does that get me any points?"
Cordelia,No.
Xander,"Come on, can't we just kiss and make up?"
Cordelia,"I don't wanna make up. (he starts to go, but she stops him)  But I'm okay with the other part. (smiles)"
Xander,"Willow, uh..."
Xander,We were just... Willow! Willow!
Xander,"Willow, come on!"
Willow,"(stops and confronts him, shaking her finger) I knew it! I knew  it! Well, not 'knew it' in the sense of having the slightest idea, but I  knew there was something I didn't know. You two were fighting way too  much. It's not natural!"
Xander,I know it's weird...
Willow,"Weird? It's against all laws of God and Man! It's (disgusted)  Cordelia! Remember? The, the 'We Hate Cordelia' club, of which you are  the treasurer."
Xander,"Look, I was gonna tell you."
Willow,"Gee, what stopped you? Could it be shame?"
Xander,"All right, let's overreact, shall we?"
Willow,But I'm...
Xander,"Willow, we were just kissing. It doesn't mean that much."
Willow,No. It just means that you'd rather be with someone you hate  than be with me.
Buffy,Angel! (runs to him)
Angelus,Hey!
Buffy,Oh!
Angelus,Hey.
Buffy,"Oh, my God! I was so worried!"
Angelus,I didn't mean to frighten you.
Buffy,Where did you go?
Angelus,Been around.
Buffy,"Ohhh. Oh, my God! (hugs him again) I was freaking out! You just  disappeared."
Angelus,What? I took off. (goes to his bed for the shirt)
Buffy,(confused) But you didn't say anything. You just left.
Angelus,(pulls on the shirt) Yeah. Like I really wanted to stick  around after that.
Buffy,What?
Angelus,"You got a lot to learn about men, kiddo. Although I guess you  proved that last night."
Buffy,What are you saying?
Angelus,"Let's not make an issue out of it, okay? (goes for his coat)  In fact, let's not talk about it at all. (pulls it on) It happened."
Buffy,"I, I don't understand. Was it m-me? (meekly) Was I not good?"
Angelus,(laughs) You were great. Really. (snidely) I thought you were  a pro.
Buffy,How can you say this to me?
Angelus,Lighten up. It was a good time. It doesn't mean like we have  to make a big deal.
Buffy,It *is* a big deal!
Angelus,"It's what? Bells ringing, fireworks, a dulcet choir of pretty  little birdies? (laughs) Come on, Buffy. It's not like I've never been  there before."
Buffy,Don't touch me.
Angelus,(shakes his finger at her) I should've known you wouldn't be  able to handle it. (starts to go)
Buffy,Angel! (he stops and faces her) (teary-eyed) I love you.
Angelus,"(points coolly at her) Love you, too. (turns away) I'll call  you."
Enyos,"You know what it is, this thing vengeance?"
Jenny,"Uncle, I have served you. I have been faithful. I need to  know..."
Enyos,"(interrupts) To the modern man vengeance is a verb, an idea.  Payback. One thing for another. Like commerce. Not with us. Vengeance is  a living thing. It passes through generations. It commands. It kills."
Jenny,You told me to watch Angel. You told me to keep him from the  Slayer. I tried. But there are other factors. There are terrible things  happening here that we cannot control.
Enyos,"We control nothing. We are not wizards, Janna. We merely play  our part."
Jenny,"Angel could be of help to us. I mean, he may be the only chance  we have to stop the Judge."
Enyos,It is too late for that.
Jenny,Why?
Enyos,"The curse. Angel is meant to suffer, not to live as human. One  moment of true happiness, of contentment, one moment where the soul that  we restored no longer plagues his thoughts, and that soul is taken from  him."
Jenny,"Then, if somehow, if... if it's happened... then Angelus is  back."
Enyos,I hoped to stop it. But I realize now it was arranged to be so.
Jenny,Buffy loves him.
Enyos,And now she will have to kill him.
Jenny,"(stands up) Unless he kills her first! Uncle, this is insanity!  People are going to die."
Enyos,Yes. It is not justice we serve. It is vengeance.
Jenny,(exhales and grabs her coat and bag) You are a fool. We're all  fools.
Xander,Will.
Willow,Hey.
Xander,Where'd you go?
Willow,Home.
Xander,I'm glad you came back. We can't do this without you.
Willow,"Let's get this straight. I don't understand it, I don't wanna  understand it, you have gross emotional problems, and things are not  okay between us. But what's happening right now is more important than  that."
Xander,Okay.
Willow,(drops her arms) What about the Judge? Where do we stand?
Xander,On a pile of really boring books that say exactly the same  thing.
Willow,Lemme guess: 'no weapon forged.'
Xander,'It took an army.'
Willow,"Yeah, where's an army when you need one? (looks at Xander)  What?"
Xander,"(looks thoughtful) Whoa. Whoa! I... I think I'm having a  thought. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a thought. Now I'm having a plan."
Xander,Now I'm having a wiggins.
Willow,What's going on?
Xander,Let's get to the library.
Angelus,(appears behind them) Willow. Xander.
Xander,Angel.
Willow,Thank God you're okay. Did you see Buffy?
Angelus,Yeah. What's up with the lights?
Xander,"I don't know. Listen, I think I have an idea."
Angelus,Forget about that now. I... I got something to show you.
Willow,Show us?
Angelus,"Yeah. Xander, go get the others."
Xander,Okay. (runs off)
Angelus,And Willow. Come here.
Willow,"(slowly walks toward him) What is it, Angel?"
Angelus,It's amazing.
Jenny,"Willow, get away from him."
Willow,(stops and looks at her) What?
Jenny,Walk to me.
Willow,What are you talking about? It's Ang...
Xander,Don't do that!
Angelus,"Oh, I think I do that."
Willow,Angel...
Jenny,He's not Angel anymore. Are you?
Angelus,Wrong. I *am* Angel. (tightens his grip on Willow) At last!
Xander,"Oh, my God."
Angelus,I got a message for Buffy.
Buffy,(appears behind him) Why don't you give it to me yourself?
Angelus,"Well, it's not really the kind of message you tell. It sort of  involves finding the bodies of all your friends."
Buffy,This can't be you.
Angelus,"Gee, we already covered that subject."
Buffy,"Angel, there must be some part of you inside that still  remembers who you are."
Angelus,"Dream on, schoolgirl."
Angelus,Your boyfriend is dead. You're all gonna join him.
Buffy,"Leave Willow alone, and deal with me."
Angelus,But she's so cute (pinches her cheek) and helpless. (Xander  gets closer) Really a turn-on.
Angelus,(whispers) Things are about to get *very* interesting.
Xander,"Buffy, you okay?"
Xander,Buffy.
Giles,"And we're absolutely certain that, that Angel has reverted to  his former self?"
Xander,"Yeah, uh, we're all certain. Anyone not feeling certain here?"
Willow,"Giles, you wouldn't have believed him. He was so... He came  here to kill us."
Cordelia,What are we gonna do?
Giles,I'm leaning towards blind panic myself.
Jenny,"Rupert, don't talk like that. The kids."
Giles,I'm sorry. It's just that things are bad enough with the Judge  here. Angel crossing over to the other side... I-I-I wasn't prepared for  that.
Jenny,None of us were.
Willow,Are you okay?
Willow,Is there anything I can do?
Buffy,"(shakes her head) I should've known. When I saw him at the  house, he was different. The things he said..."
Giles,What things?
Buffy,It's private.
Jenny,But you didn't know he had turned bad?
Willow,(looks at Jenny) How did you?
Jenny,(looks at Willow) What?
Willow,"Well, you knew. You told me to get away from him."
Jenny,"Well, I saw his face."
Giles,If only we knew how it happened. (sits on the table)
Buffy,What do you mean?
Giles,"Well, something set it off. Some, some, uh, event must've  triggered his transformation. Well, if anyone would know, Buffy, it-it  should be you."
Buffy,I don't.
Giles,"Well, did anything happen last night that, that might..."
Buffy,"Giles, please, I can't. (runs from the library)"
Giles,"Buffy, I'm sorry, but we can't afford to... Buffy!"
Willow,"(watching Buffy run) Giles, shut up."
Cordelia,"This is great. There's an unkillable demon in town, Angel's  joined his team, the Slayer is a basket case... I'd say we've hit  bottom."
Xander,I have a plan.
Cordelia,"Oh, no, here's a lower place."
Xander,"I don't know what's up with Angel, but I think I may have a way  to deal with this Judge guy."
Willow,What do we do?
Xander,"I think, um... (looks at Cordelia, then back at Willow) I think  I may need Cordelia for this one."
Xander,And we may need wheels.
Cordelia,"Well, my car is..."
Xander,It might have to be bigger.
Willow,No problem. I'll get Oz. He has a van.
Xander,Good. (looks at Cordelia) Okay.
Cordelia,Care to let me in on the plan I'm a part of?
Xander,No.
Cordelia,Why not? (stands up with her hands on her hips)
Xander,"Because if I tell you, then you won't do it. Just meet me at  Willow's house in half an hour. And wear something trashy... (looks at  her) ...er. (walks off)"
Giles,I'm not sure what we should do about Buffy.
Jenny,Assuming they don't attack tonight I think we should just let  her be.
Willow,I agree.
Giles,I-I-I can imagine what she's going through.
Willow,"No, I don't think you can."
Angelus,You should've seen her face. It was priceless. (hops up on a  conveyor platform and sits) I'll never forget it.
Spike,So you didn't kill her then.
Angelus,Of course not.
Spike,"(exhales) Now, I know you haven't been in the game for a while,  mate, but we still do kill people. Sort of our raison d'etre, you know."
Drusilla,"You don't want to kill her, do you? (pokes Miss Edith's eyes)  You want to hurt her. (smiles up at him) Just like you hurt me."
Angelus,"Nobody knows me like you do, Dru."
Spike,She'd better not get in our way.
Angelus,Don't worry about it.
Spike,I do.
Angelus,"Spike, (slams his hand on a crate) my boy, (pushes it along  the rollers) you *really* don't get it! (stands up) Do you? (chuckles)  You tried to kill her, but you couldn't. (chuckles) Look at you. You're  a wreck! (approaches him) She's stronger than any Slayer you've ever  faced. (hops off of the platform) Force won't get it done. You gotta  work from the inside. (sits on the platform) To kill this girl... you  have to love her."
Angel,I love you.
Angel,You have to know what to see.
Giles,"Oh, Buffy."
Giles,Buffy! (tries to pull her off)
Buffy,What do you know?!
Student,(gets up) Should I get the principal?
Giles,"(to the class) No, I-I-I'll deal with this. Y-y-you're, you're  all dismissed! (they all leave)"
Buffy,(lets go and steps back) Did you do it? Did you change him?
Giles,"For God's sake, calm down!"
Buffy,Did you know this was gonna happen?
Giles,You can't go around accusing everybody...
Jenny,"(interrupts) I didn't know... exactly. I was told... (whispers)  Oh, God. (speaks) I was sent here to watch you. They told me to keep you  and Angel apart. They never told me what would happen."
Giles,(surprised and confused) Jenny!
Jenny,"I'm sorry, Rupert. Angel was supposed to pay for what he did to  my people."
Buffy,And me? What was I supposed to be paying for?
Jenny,I didn't know what would happen until after. I swear I would've  told you.
Buffy,So it was me. I did it.
Jenny,"I think so. I mean, if you..."
Giles,(demanding) I don't understand.
Jenny,"The curse. If Angel achieved true happiness, even just a moment  of... He would lose his soul."
Giles,W-w-w-h-h-how do you know you were responsible f-for...
Giles,Oh.
Jenny,If there is anything that...
Buffy,Curse him again.
Jenny,"No, I-I can't. I mean, those magicks are long lost even to my  people."
Buffy,You did it once. It might not be too late to save him.
Jenny,It can't be done. I can't help you.
Buffy,Then take me to someone who can.
Enyos,I knew she would bring you. I suppose you want answers.
Angelus,Not really.
Angelus,But thanks for the offer.
Sergeant,"Right face, hu! Double-time, hu! (they march off) Left, left,  left, left..."
Xander,"Wait here. When you guys see that window open get out the  ladder, come up, we'll pass you the package, okay?"
Oz,Okay.
Willow,Be careful.
Xander,"The security here really is a joke. I should, uh, report it."
Cordelia,Who am I supposed to be again?
Xander,You're supposed to be a girl. Think you can handle it?
Soldier,Halt! (Xander shoots up his arms) Identify yourself right the  hell now.
Xander,"Uh... Private Harris with the, uh... 33rd."
Soldier,33rd are on maneuvers.
Xander,"Right! Uh, I'm on leave. (turns around slowly) From them."
Soldier,"You always spend your leave snooping around the armory, pal?  And who is she?"
Cordelia,Hi. I'm not a soldier. (to Xander) Right?
Xander,"(approaches the guard, hands still up) Look, I... I just want  to give her the tour. Uh, you know what I'm saying."
Soldier,The tour.
Xander,"Well, you know the ladies. They like to see the big guns. Gets  them all hot and bothered. Can you cut me some slack, gimme a blind eye?"
Soldier,And why should I?
Xander,"Well, if you do, I won't tell Colonel Newsome that your boots  ain't regulation, your post wasn't covered, (grabs his M-16 and gives it  back to him properly) and you hold your gun like a sissy girl."
Soldier,"(takes the rifle) You got 20 minutes, nimrod."
Xander,"(smiles) I just need 5. (starts for the door, but looks back)  Uh, forget I said that last part."
Cordelia,"Okay, what was that? And who are you?"
Xander,"Remember Halloween, I got turned into a soldier?"
Cordelia,Yeah.
Xander,"Well, I still remember all of it. I know procedure, ordnance,  access codes, everything. I know the whole layout for this base, and I'm  pretty sure I can put together an M-16 in 57 seconds."
Cordelia,"Well, I'm sort of impressed. But let's just find the thing  and get out of here."
Xander,Okay. (starts looking around)
Cordelia,"(hops onto a crate to sit) So, does looking at guns really  make girls wanna have sex? That's scary."
Xander,"Yeah, I guess."
Cordelia,"Well, does looking at guns make you wanna have sex?"
Xander,I'm seventeen. Looking at linoleum makes me wanna have sex.
Willow,I wish they'd hurry. (cut inside the van)
Oz,"So, do you guys steal weapons from the Army a lot?"
Willow,"Well, we don't have cable, so we have to make our own fun."
Oz,I get you.
Willow,(after a pause) Do you wanna make out with me?
Oz,What?
Willow,"(looks away) Forget it. I'm sorry. (decides she wants to know)  Well, do you?"
Oz,"Sometimes when I'm sitting in class... You know, I'm not thinking  about class, 'cause that would never happen. I think about kissing you.  And it's like everything stops. It's like, it's like freeze frame.  Willow kissage."
Oz,"Oh, I'm not gonna kiss you."
Willow,(confused) What? But freeze frame!
Oz,"Well, to the casual observer, it would appear that you're trying to  make your friend Xander jealous or even the score or something. And  that's on the empty side. (looks off into space) See, in my fantasy when  I'm kissing *you*, you're kissing *me*. (looks back at her) It's okay. I  can wait. (sees the window open) We're up."
Jenny,"Oh, my God."
Giles,"He's doing this deliberately, Buffy. He's trying to make it  harder for you."
Buffy,He's only making it easier. I know what I have to do.
Giles,What?
Buffy,Kill him.
Judge,I am ready.
Spike,About time.
Spike,Have fun.
Angelus,"(bending to Spike's ear) Too bad you can't come with, huh?  I'll be thinkin' of you."
Spike,I won't be in this chair forever.
Spike,What happens if your girlfriend shows up?
Angelus,I'm gonna give her a kiss. (to the Judge) Don't you look  spiffy!
Judge,Spiffy?
Xander,"Happy Birthday, Buffy. I hope you like the color. (steps back)"
Buffy,"Giles, we go to the factory first, but they might not be there.  They're on the offensive. We need to figure out where they'd go."
Giles,Agreed. (opens the box)
Buffy,(looks into the box) This is good.
Jenny,"(in the doorway) Do you, uh... (Giles looks at her) Is there  something I can do?"
Buffy,Get out.
Jenny,I-I just want to help.
Giles,(looks away) She just said get out.
Xander,(steps up) Do you want me to show you how to use it?
Buffy,"Yes, I do."
Buffy,I knew it.
Giles,(looking up and around) We haven't a bead on where they would  go?
Buffy,"(exhales) I don't know, uh... somewhere crowded, I guess. I  mean, the Judge needs bodies, right?"
Willow,The Bronze?
Xander,It's closed tonight.
Cordelia,There's not a lot of choices in Sunnydale. It's not like  people are gonna line up to get massacred.
Oz,"Uh, guys? If I were gonna line up, I know where I'd go."
Angelus,"Lock the exits, boys."
Angelus,(to the Judge) It's all yours.
Buffy,Everybody keep back. Damage control only. Take out any lesser  vamps if you can. I'll handle the Smurf.
Drusilla,"(bouncing with glee) Oh, goody!"
Judge,Who dares?
Buffy,Think I got his attention.
Judge,You're a fool. (cut to him) No weapon forged can stop me.
Buffy,(cut to her) (lowers the bow) That was then.
Buffy,This is now.
Judge,What's that do?
Buffy,Best present ever. (hands the weapon down to Xander)
Xander,Knew you'd like it.
Willow,Do you think he's dead?
Buffy,We can't be sure. Pick up the pieces and keep them separate.
Cordelia,Pieces? We get the pieces. Our job sucks!
Angelus,"You know what the worst part was, huh? Pretending that I loved  you. If I'd known how easily you'd give it up, I wouldn't have even  bothered."
Buffy,(gets up) That doesn't work anymore. You're not Angel.
Angelus,"You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? It doesn't matter. The  important thing is you made me the man I am today! (smiles evilly)"
Oz,Uh... (points) Arm.
Angelus,"Not quittin' on me already, are ya? (she looks up at him) Come  on, Buffy. You know you want it, huh?"
Angelus,You can't do it. You can't kill me.
Buffy,Give me time.
Giles,"It's not over. I-I-I suppose you know that. He'll come after  you, particularly. His profile, uh, well, he... he's likely to strike  out at the things that made him the most human."
Buffy,You must be so disappointed in me.
Giles,"No. (she looks at him) No, no, I'm not."
Buffy,But this is all my fault.
Giles,"No. I don't believe it is. Do you want me to wag my finger at  you and tell you that you acted rashly? You did. A-and I can. I know  that you loved him. And... he... has proven more than once that he loved  you. You couldn't have known what would happen. The coming months a-are  gonna, are gonna be hard... I, I suspect on all of us, but... if it's  guilt you're looking for, Buffy, I'm, I'm not your man. All you will get  from me is, is my support. And my respect."
Lyrics,"<I>Goodnight, my love / My moment with you now is ending / It was  so heavenly holding you close to me</I>"
Joyce,Did I miss anything?
Buffy,Um... just some singing and some running around.
Joyce,Mm. I'm sorry I didn't have time to make you a real cake. (finds  the matches)
Buffy,No. This is good.
Joyce,But we're still going shopping on Saturday. (Buffy looks at her)  So what'd you do for your birthday? Did you have fun?
Buffy,"(looks down, then back up) I got older."
Joyce,(looks into her face) You look the same to me.
Joyce,"Happy Birthday. (smiles) I don't have to sing, do I?"
Buffy,(looks down at her hands) No.
Joyce,"(indicates the burning candle) Well, go on, make a wish."
Buffy,I'll just let it burn.
Lyrics,"<I>Sleep tight, my love / Goodnight, my love / Remember that  you're mine, sweetheart</I>"
