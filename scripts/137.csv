SPIKE,"<br>  You're really talking to the wrong fella."
ANYA,"<br>  I mean, sure, the vengeance demon gig has some downsides..."
SPIKE,"<br>  All jobs do."
ANYA,"<br>  But being human? Ugh! You're always icky on the inside, disgusting on the outside."
SPIKE,"<br>  (stops, turns to look at her) Your outside's not so bad."
ANYA,"<br>  (blushes) You know, the only thing worse than being human is being trapped inside   a house full of humans."
SPIKE,"<br>  Preaching to the choir, luv."
ANYA,"<br>  I mean, it's like we live in slayer central. I swear, if Buffy rooms or boards   one more of the potential girls, I'm gonna call a&#151;I'm gonna call a health inspector."
SPIKE,"<br>  I like my plan better. Get up, get out, get drunk. Repeat as needed. It's just   more elegant. (starts walking again)"
ANYA,"<br>  (puts her arm through his) Thanks for having me along."
SPIKE,"<br>  (looks at Anya's arm through his) Don't mention it."
ANYA,"<br>  At first, I thought... it's weird. Is Spike asking me out on a date? 'Cause   that would just be...(unlaces her arm from his) nuts. (laughs nervously)"
SPIKE,"<br>  Right. I'm just out for the alcohol."
ANYA,"<br>  Right there with you, scooter. (puts her hands in her pockets) Tonight, I plan   to drink you under the table."
SPIKE,"<br>  You're on, then."
ANYA,"<br>  Good. (shrugs) Of course, once you're down there, I could join you. Kidding.   I like my sex on top of the table."
SPIKE,"<br>  (looks up to the sky) Would you let it go? You're like a dog with a bone!"
ANYA,"<br>  So what?"
SPIKE,"<br>  It's my bone. Just drop it."
ANYA,"<br>  OK. OK. I wasn't proposing. Time goes by, girl gets hungry. You should know."

BUFFY,"<br>  This may mean more than you think."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Is that so?"
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Because I think what we have here is a couple of chuckle-heads who thought that   a cafeteria fist fight would impress. I'm not impressed. Buffy, are you impressed?   (Buffy purses her lips and shakes her head disapprovingly) Still, I'm gonna   cut you guys some slack this time.

BUFFY,"<br>  The hellmouth has begun its semi-annual percolation. Usually, it blows around   May."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Was it like this before? I mean, it just seems to me as if things are getting   bad faster than we thought."
BUFFY,"<br>  We're a little ahead of schedule."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  I can't say I'm too surprised. I knew I signed on for something, but, Buffy,   I'm just a guy. Granted, a cool and sexy vampire-fighting guy, but still."
BUFFY,"<br>  (smiles) Don't forget &quot;snappy dresser.&quot;"
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  (smiles) Mm. Thank you. But this is gonna get bigger than me."
BUFFY,"<br>  Yeah, it is."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  That's why I've decided to give you this."
BUFFY,"<br>  What is it?"
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  An emergency kit. This bag belonged to my mother."
BUFFY,"<br>  A slayer keepsake. I-I couldn't."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Well, you have to. Technically, it should have been passed down directly to   you through the years, but after my mother died... I guess I just couldn't part   with it."
BUFFY,"<br>  Wow!"
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  I don't know what's inside, exactly, but I know it has something to do with   her power. Well, your power now."
BUFFY,"<br>  I-I don't know what to say."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Try saying, &quot;Thank you, Principal Wood.&quot;"
BUFFY,"<br>  Thank you, Principal Wood."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  (grins) Ah, call me Robin. Now, I'd like to see where you work."
BUFFY,"<br>  Uh, here, actually. (touches her desk) Uh, th-this is my desk, and, uh, (holds   up her pencil holder) these are my pencils..."

BUFFY,"<br>  So, all the potential slayers&#151;who seem to keep popping up from, like, every   corner of the earth&#151; (shuts the door) were getting killed."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  By the First."
BUFFY,"<br>  Agents of. We thought the Council could protect them, but, unfortunately, no   one was protecting the Council, and all their watchers were killed. Word got   out, and they've all been coming here since."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Well, there's nothing like the end of the world to bring people together."
BUFFY,"<br>  It's heartwarming. Anyway, this is, uh, it. Command central."
ANDREW,"<br>  (storms into the room wearing a white apron and a red and white checked oven   mitt on each hand) Where the hell have you been? (crosses arms) This funnel   cake is kicking my ass."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Yeah, I hear they're tricky."
BUFFY,"<br>  Robin Wood, this is...Andrew."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  (offers his hand) It's a pleasure. (shakes hands with Andrew)"
BUFFY,"<br>  Andrew is our&#151;actually, he's our hostage."
ANDREW,"<br>  I like to think of myself more as a (makes quote marks in the air with his mitted   hands) &quot;guestage.&quot;"
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  (to Buffy) So, you&#151;you hold him here against his will?"
BUFFY,"<br>  Well, he was evil, and people got killed, and now he...bakes. It's a thing."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Oh."
ANDREW,"<br>  Could we try to just keep our secret headquarters a little bit secret? Keep   bringing people in, they're gonna see everything. They'll see the big board."
BUFFY,"<br>  Andrew, we don't have a big board."
ANDREW,"<br>  (runs to fetch a white dry-erase board from behind the chair) I, uh, made it   myself."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Oh, I wouldn't have guessed."
ANDREW,"<br>  (pointing to the board) Uh, this is us. And this represents the First in various   incarnations. And, uh, there's no pattern to the naked eye yet, but the instant   one emerges, yours truly is on it. (Buffy and Wood look at each other, then   walk away; Andrew calls after them) Where do we put our receipts?"

POTENTIALS,"<br>  Huh!"
KENNEDY,"<br>  Chamber your energy. Punch block combo! (Chloe does the moves incorrectly, and   Kennedy notices, walking up to her) Hold it! What the hell do you call that,   potential? Try that in the field, you are dead. Drop, and give me 20."
CHLOE,"<br>  20 what?"
KENNEDY,"<br>  (in her face) Push-ups, maggot! (Chloe drops to do push-ups; Kennedy turns toward   Buffy and Wood, still scowling, then suddenly grinning and giddy) I love this   job! Did you see that? I called that girl &quot;maggot.&quot; (to Wood) Hi.   (hands on her hips again) Who the hell are you?"
BUFFY,"<br>  An ally."
KENNEDY,"<br>  So, what do you think? My girls ready to kick some ass, or what?"
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Looking strong."
KENNEDY,"<br>  But...?"
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Well, I'm just not sure the First has an ass that you can actually, you know,   kick."
KENNEDY,"<br>  (smirks) Guess we'll see."
AMANDA,"<br>  (waving) Principal Wood, hi! It's so weird seeing you outside of school."
KENNEDY,"<br>  (to Amanda) What are you waving at, potential? Attention!"
POTENTIALS,"<br>  Huh!"
KENNEDY,"<br>  Rising sun. Begin. (they continue their training as Buffy and Wood talk)"
BUFFY,"<br>  You're right, it's not enough."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  That's not what I said, Buffy. It's an impressive group of recruits."
BUFFY,"<br>  They're not recruits. Recruits are...recruited. These girls were chosen."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  You're doing the best you can with what you've got."
BUFFY,"<br>  They're not all gonna make it. Some will die, and nothing I can do will stop   that."
WILLOW,"<br>  Oh, hi. Hey. Well, Buffy, I&#151;I see that our preparation for the school-pep-dance-cheer-drill   contest are coming along. (to the potentials) Bring it on!"
BUFFY,"<br>  It's OK, I filled him in on everything."
WILLOW,"<br>  (lets out a sigh of relief) Oh, thank God! If I had to explain all these weapons,   I had nothing. (puts down the weapons)"
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Buffy tells me you have been, um&#151;oh, how shall I put it&#151;experimenting. (Willow's   eyes grow wide; she casts a &quot;you said what?&quot; glance at Buffy) With   the magicks."
WILLOW,"<br>  (laughs nervously) Oh! Yeah. Oh, nothing too heavy, though. Just the lighter,   safer stuff. Uh, if Kennedy asks, her pointy stuff's right there. See you inside.   (to Buffy) So much cooler than Snyder."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  She really almost destroyed the world?"
BUFFY,"<br>  (nods) Yep."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Remind me not to make her crabby."
BUFFY,"<br>  It might be better if you did."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  How's that work?"
BUFFY,"<br>  Oh, I don't know. It's just&#151;the First is coming, and then look at us: the army.   We've got a bunch of fighters with nothing to hit, a Wicca who won't-a, and the   brains of our operation wears oven mitts."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Hm. Well, you're redefining the job, Buffy, and that takes guts. This isn't   your full arsenal anyway. Show me the vampire."

SPIKE,"<br>  After saving your life."
ANYA,"<br>  For now. That was one of D'Hoffryn's killers, Spike. He won't stop coming 'til   he kills me."
SPIKE,"<br>  Yet here you are, walking, talking, annoying."
ANYA,"<br>  But you fought like such a wimpire, what with the lifting and the running. Why   not just kill him?"
SPIKE,"<br>  Anya, think. I fight, demon boy gets lucky, I get knocked out, you get killed.   True? (Anya thinks, starts to speak, rolls her eyes) We both know the safest   and sanest way of saving your life was to keep you with me, away from danger.   (Anya grunts, shakes her head and walks away) No need to thank me. I'm just   the one who beat him off. (looks at Buffy) Repelled him would perhaps be the   better phrase. (Buffy nods) Demon."
BUFFY,"<br>  Figured."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  (from across the room, not facing Spike) I hope we're not intruding."
SPIKE,"<br>  Not a bit. And just what brings our good principal to this neck of the gloom?"
BUFFY,"<br>  I'm showing him our operation. Us."
SPIKE,"<br>  Fine by me. (nods) Big fight against evil coming up. The more good guys we've   got, the longer we'll all live."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  (still not facing Spike) Is that what you are? A good guy?"
SPIKE,"<br>  (turns from Buffy toward Wood) I haven't heard any complaints. Well, I have   heard a few complaints over the years, but then I just killed whoever spoke   up, and that was pretty much that. (Woods turns to face Spike)"
BUFFY,"<br>  He's joking."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  (glaring at Spike) No, he's not."
SPIKE,"<br>  (looking at Wood) No, I'm not. (softly) But...that's the old me I'm talking   about."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Why don't you tell me about that?"
SPIKE,"<br>  Not much to tell. I've changed."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Oh, now that you have a soul. (nods)"
SPIKE,"<br>  Yeah. That was a big deal. Very... private. (hurt, to Buffy) What, are you just   telling everyone now?"
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Oh, come on, Spike. Don't blame Buffy. I asked. (walks toward Spike)"
SPIKE,"<br>  (walks toward Wood) Right, the educator. (facing each other now, only a few   feet apart) Yeah, I went to great lengths. Lots of trouble, and now I'm unique.   Well, more or less. Got myself a soul, whatever that means."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  And how's that working out for you?"
SPIKE,"<br>  In progress."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Well, you've had some time. You've been in Sunnydale, what...?"
SPIKE,"<br>  Years."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  How many?"
SPIKE,"<br>  A few."
PRINCIPAL WOOD,"<br>  Before that?"
SPIKE,"<br>  Around. (Spike's gritting his teeth, huffing, pursing his lips as Wood needles   him)"
BUFFY,"<br>  (stepping up, nearly in between them) I think we'd better get back upstairs."

BUFFY,"<br>  And?"
DAWN,"<br>  Smelled weird. Kinda like Grandma's closet, but worse."
BUFFY,"<br>  I didn't know what was possible. Anything we could use?"
DAWN,"<br>  Trinkets, weapons, one very large textbook. (picks up the book, flips through   it) Translation's gonna be a bitch, but... Do you know that ancient Sumerians   do not speak English?"
BUFFY,"<br>  (scoffs) They're worse than the French. Anything else?"
