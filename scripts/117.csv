<BLOCKQUOTE>GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire   Slayer</I>...
WILLOW,Hey Dawnie.
XANDER,"So, uh, anything new about Warren and the Nerd Herd?"
DAWN,No.
XANDER,"Man, a nerd goes into hiding, he really goes into hiding."
DAWN,Big wedding coming up ... lots of date possibilities   ... you and Tara are speaking again. You wanna call her?
WILLOW,No. But if   I did call? She wouldn't hang up on me.
DAWN,You can't even stand to be around me.
BUFFY,That is not   true.
DAWN,You didn't wanna come back.
BUFFY,It's over.
SPIKE,"I've memorized this tune, luv."
BUFFY,"I'm using you. And it's killing me. I'm sorry, William."
ANYA,This is it.
BUFFY,Are you ready to go?
WILLOW,He's gone.
ANYA,Xander's gone? Xander's missing?
ANYA,What do you mean Xander's missing?
Cut to,close shot on a computer monitor showing Buffy walking toward the   camera.
ANDREW,"Oh man, your face was priceless."
JONATHAN,"(angry) Yeah, real   funny."
WARREN,It serves you right for taking Z's on lookout   again.
JONATHAN,"What do you expect? I haven't had a decent night's sleep   since... (Warren glaring at him) I mean, I'm going Jack Torrence in here, you   know? Stuck in this basement for weeks! I mean, we rented the whole house,   can't we at least sleep upstairs?"
ANDREW,We're on the lam. We have to lay   low. Underground?
JONATHAN,"It's figurative, doofus! Did you even read   <I>Legion of Doom</I>? (Andrew jumping up in outrage)"
WARREN,"Okay, enough!   Midgetor, get back to the monitors. The last thing we need is to be surprised   by-"
ANDREW,(looking at monitors) Holy Geez Louise.
JONATHAN,The-the-
WARREN,The frickin' Slayer.
JONATHAN,She's right   there!
WARREN,"All right, don't panic. Andrew ... deploy your little   friend."
BUFFY,Oh. Hi.
BUFFY,"You didn't by chance happen to just eat a couple of nerds, did you?"
MAN 1,You're gonna hurt yourself!
MAN 2,She's gonna break the needle.   (removes needle from Buffy's arm) We're gonna have to strap her down.
Cut to,"UC Sunnydale campus, day. Various students walking around, etc."
WILLOW,"(OS) Hi, um, Tara, how are you?"
WILLOW,"W-well, I-I was wondering, maybe, you would wanna go out sometime?   For coffee ... food ... kisses and gay love? (sighs) Hi Tara. Guess what?   Magic-free now for, insert number, days now."
Cut to,close shot on a pile of french fries sitting in a hopper a heat   lamp. More fries in the boiler cooking.
LORRAINE,(OS) Buffy.
LORRAINE,Buffy.
FEMALE DOCTOR,"Come on, it's time for your drugs."
BUFFY,(confused) What?
LORRAINE,"I said, if I didn't know any better,   I'd think you were on drugs."
BUFFY,(confused) Okay. Good.
BUFFY,Whatcha doin'?
WILLOW,"I'm online, checking to see if Xander emailed."
BUFFY,(sits) Any   luck?
WILLOW,No such.
BUFFY,"(hopeful) Well, maybe Anya found him and   they're trying to work it out. (Willow shrugs) How come you're all, home,   hearth, and DSL anyway? I thought you were gonna go see Tara."
WILLOW,(unhappy) Saw her. Saw her completely.
BUFFY,Ouch. Just got a scratch from   all that brittle.
WILLOW,"It's... (closing laptop) ...when I was seeing   her, she was seeing someone else. A girl."
BUFFY,You mean-
WILLOW,"I   mean ... not ""seeing"" seeing. Well, maybe. I don't know, it was inconclusive,   and I didn't stick around to find out. Might have magicked my fist through a   wall or something,"
BUFFY,"(softly) Will, I'm sorry."
WILLOW,"I mean,   they're probably just friends. (pouty) I press my lips against my friends' all   the time."
BUFFY,"I'm sure they're just friends. Once you fall for Willow,   you stay fallen."
WILLOW,"Thanks, Buffy."
XANDER,Hi.
WILLOW,Xander?
XANDER,I'm back.
BUFFY,Xander?
WILLOW,"Xander, you're here!"
WILLOW,"We missed you, where were you?"
XANDER,"I know, I tried calling,   but I couldn't without..."
BUFFY,Hey. You don't need to explain to us.
XANDER,Right. Is she here?
WILLOW,"Oh ... n-no, you ... wanna find   her?"
XANDER,"I need to. Her suitcase is gone and some of her stuff. There's   a Closed sign on the Magic Box, which, like, chills me to the bone."
WILLOW,She left a couple days ago.
XANDER,"Was she looking for me? (Willow   fidgeting) Before she left, did she say anything?"
WILLOW,"You mean, between   sobs? (Xander looking guilty) There was mostly just wheezing."
BUFFY,She   was a little ... she was ... kinda broken.
XANDER,I don't know how stuff   got so mixed up! (sighs) I blew it.
BUFFY,"No. Well ... maybe it wasn't the   best time to break up with her, but..."
XANDER,"No. It wasn't about breaking   up. I love her, and god, I miss her so much."
WILLOW,"So, you left her at   the altar, but you still wanna-"
BUFFY,You still wanna date?
XANDER,"I   guess. I know that I'm a better person with her in my life. But things got so   complicated with the wedding, and with my family, and with her ... demons, and   ... what if it all goes to hell, a-and forever? (the girls looking   sympathetic) But then I left ... and ever since ... I've had this painful hole   inside. (Buffy looking pensive) And I'm the idiot that dug it out."
XANDER,I screwed up real bad.
BUFFY,Hey. We all screw up.
SPIKE,You lookin' for me?
BUFFY,Really not.
SPIKE,Oh. Right then. Off you go. (lighting up) Did you cry?
BUFFY,(stops walking) What?
SPIKE,"The wedding. Two hearts joined for eternity,   great pelting showers of rice and so forth."
BUFFY,You didn't hear.
SPIKE,What? Families get out of hand? Tear the place apart?
BUFFY,"No.   Well, yes, absolutely. But ... Xander left. The wedding didn't   happen."
SPIKE,(surprised) Well. Gotta say ... I didn't see that coming.   (sits on a bench)
BUFFY,It was awful. (sits nearby) Anya was   devastated.
SPIKE,Is that right.
BUFFY,"And, Xander ... thinks maybe   they can still get back together, but ... he hurt her a lot."
SPIKE,"Yeah,   well ... some people can't see a good thing when they've got it."
XANDER,(OS) Spike.
XANDER,I shoulda known you'd be tagging along.
BUFFY,"(stands) Hey,   guys. I, uh ... I found Spike and was, uh, trying to figure out what kind of   dangerous contraband he had."
SPIKE,"(looks disgusted, gets up) Tell you   what, Slayer. (drops his cigarette and grinds it out with one foot) Let me get   out of your way. (picks up grocery bag) I'll stop bothering you."
XANDER,"Yeah, maybe you should do that, Spike, just run along."
SPIKE,"You know, I   guess you know all about that, don't you? (going over to Xander) The king of   the big exit. (Xander lookng upset) Heard it brought the house   down."
XANDER,I don't need this crap from you.
SPIKE,Right. Let's not   listen to Spike. (turns to look at Buffy) Might get a bit of the truth on you.
WILLOW,"Okay, okay. Heh. Calm now. (Spike and Xander glaring at each other)   Let's, uh, turn around and release this very manly thing the other   way."
XANDER,"I forgot. Willy Wannabite can't hurt me. (to Spike) Dumb to   pick a fight, I guess."
WILLOW,Xander.
BUFFY,(weakly) Guys...
SPIKE,"More than happy to beat you right through   the pain, you pathetic poof."
BUFFY,"Guys, don't."
MAN,"Buffy, can you hear me?"
BUFFY,(panting) What is this?
DOCTOR,"Do you know where you are,   Buffy?"
BUFFY,(confused) Sunnydale.
DOCTOR,"No, none of that's real,   none of it. You're in a mental institution. (Buffy frowning at the floor,   shaking her head) You've been with us now for six years. Do you remember?"
WILLOW,Buffy? Are you okay?
XANDER,What happened?
DOCTOR,"It's okay, Buffy. Buffy, it's okay."
DOCTOR,Look. Look who's here.
JOYCE,Buffy?
JOYCE,"Welcome home, sweetie."
BUFFY,(softly) Mom?
JOYCE,"(tearful) Oh, baby, you're really   here."
BUFFY,(whispers) Dad?
DOCTOR,"She's lucid. Keep talking, maybe   the sound of your voice will ground her."
HANK,"Sweetheart ... we've missed you very much. Honey, can you hear me?"
JOYCE,"Oh, Buffy, stay with us, please."
BUFFY,Oh ... no!
SPIKE,"Here, let's get her back to my crypt."
XANDER,"Spike, just go,   okay? (Buffy looking confused) She's our friend, we'll take care of her."
BUFFY,"No, guys, I'm okay. I'm okay."
WILLOW,"Come on, Xander, help me   get her home."
SPIKE,(calls) Put a little ice on the back of her neck.
SPIKE,(to himself) She likes that.
BUFFY,"(OS) I've been having these flashes. Hallucinations, I guess."
WILLOW,Since when?
BUFFY,Uh ... night before last.
BUFFY,"I was, uh, checking houses on that list you gave me, and looking for   Warren and his pals ... and then, bam! Some kind of gross, waxy demon-thing   poked me."
XANDER,And when you say poke...
BUFFY,"(rolling her eyes) In   the arm. (Xander and Willow exchanging a look) It stung me or something, and   ... then I was like ... no. It, it wasn't ""like."" I *was* in an institution.   There were, um ... doctors and ... nurses and, and other patients. They, they   told me that I was sick. I guess crazy. And that, um, Sunnydale and, and all   of this, it ... none of it ... was real."
XANDER,"Oh, come on, that's   ridiculous! What? You think this isn't real just because of all the vampires   and demons and ex-vengeance demons and the sister that used to be a big ball   of universe-destroying energy? (pauses, frowns)"
BUFFY,"I know how this must   sound, but ... it felt so real. (softly) Mom was there."
DAWN,She   was?
BUFFY,"Dad, too. They were together ... (distantly) like they used to   be ... before Sunnydale."
WILLOW,"(stands up hastily, raises her hand) Okay!   All in favor of research? (Xander raises his hand) Motion passed. All right,   Xander, you hit the demon bars. Dig up any info on a new player in town."
WILLOW,"(OS)   Dawnie, you can help me research. We'll hop on-line, check all the-"
DOCTOR,"(OS) -possibilities for a full   recovery, (shot of the doctor sitting behind a desk) but we have to proceed   cautiously. If we're not careful--"
JOYCE,Wait.
JOYCE,Are you saying that Buffy could be like she was before any of this   happened?
DOCTOR,"(gets up, comes around the desk) Mrs. Summers, you have   to understand the severity of what's happened to your daughter. (sits on the   edge of his desk) For the last six years, she's been in an undifferentiated   type of schizophrenia."
HANK,We know what her condition is. (Buffy   frowning) That's not what we're asking.
DOCTOR,Buffy's delusions are   multi-layered. (Joyce and Hank listening intently) She believes she's some   type of hero.
JOYCE,The Slayer.
DOCTOR,"The Slayer, right, but that's   only one level. She's also created an intricate latticework to support her   primary delusion. In her mind, she's the central figure in a fantastic world   beyond imagination. (Buffy staring into the distance, frowning) She's   surrounded herself with friends, most with their own superpowers ... who are   as real to her as you or me. More so, unfortunately. Together they face ...   grand overblown conflicts against an assortment of monsters both imaginary and   rooted in actual myth. Every time we think we're getting through to her, more   fanciful enemies magically appear-"
BUFFY,(suddenly realizing) How did I   miss-
DOCTOR,and she's-
BUFFY,"Warren and Jonathan, they did this to   me!"
DOCTOR,"Buffy, it's all right. They can't hurt you here. You're with your   family."
BUFFY,(tearful) Dawn?
HANK,"(to doctor) That's the sister,   right?"
DOCTOR,"A magical key. Buffy inserted Dawn into her delusion,   actually rewriting the entire history of it to accommodate a need for a   familial bond. (to Buffy) Buffy, but that created inconsistencies, didn't it?   (Buffy staring at him) Your sister, your friends, all of those people you   created in Sunnydale, they aren't as comforting as they once were. Are they?   They're coming apart."
JOYCE,"Buffy, listen to what the doctor's saying, it's   important."
DOCTOR,"Buffy, you used to create these grand villains to battle   against, and now what is it? Just ordinary students you went to high school   with. (Buffy staring at him) No gods or monsters ... just three pathetic   little men ... who like playing with toys."
WARREN,"Dude, that poison has got her drooling like a, some kind   of-"
JONATHAN,(upset) Where have you guys been?
WARREN,Uh ... picking up some stuff. (continues down the   stairs)
ANDREW,(follows Warren) And checking out Buffy on the van's remote   surveillance.
WARREN,Andrew's demon pet has done some number on the slayer. Got her   tripping like a Ken Russell film festival.
JONATHAN,"Well, what kind of stuff?"
WARREN,What?
JONATHAN,The   packages. What's in them?
WARREN,"Well, what do you think, Spanky, you   think we're plotting against you?"
JONATHAN,Better not be. (Andrew rolling   his eyes)
WARREN,"It's just stuff, big man. All right, you'll be in the   know just as soon as you stop being all freakazoid."
WARREN,"Ah, now, there's the vault."
ANDREW,I still say we're gonna need   eight other guys to pull this off.
WARREN,I never should have let you see   that movie.
WARREN,"Wha, uh, where you going? (jumps up to follow   Jonathan)"
JONATHAN,Out. Getting stuff I need.
WARREN,"You know, I don't   really think that's such a good idea."
JONATHAN,Why not?
WARREN,"(pauses) Well, it's... (puts arm around Jonathan's shoulders, sighs) It's just   not safe out there ... alone. (leading Jonathan away from the stairs) You saw   how close the slayer got. (Jonathan looking unconvinced) Look, we're, we're a   team. Something happens to you, it happens to all of us. Right? (Andrew   watching anxiously) Look, I know, I know you're antsy, we all are, but you   see, things, they're about to pick up. Big, big time. Just gotta be careful.   Right? All right? Stick together. Okay?"
WILLOW,"(smiling) Look, Buffy, I found the demon. Fits your description and   symptoms perfectly."
WILLOW,"Look, is this it?"
WILLOW,"(smiling) See, it's gonna be okay. Its pokey stinger carries an   antidote to its own poison."
BUFFY,(very quietly) I feel so lost.
WILLOW,"I know. You're confused.   It's, it's that crazy juice inside you."
BUFFY,It's more than that. (Willow   frowning) Even before the demon ... I've been so detached.
WILLOW,We've   ... all been kind of slumming.
BUFFY,Every day I try to ... snap out of   it. Figure out why I'm like that.
WILLOW,"Buffy, look at me."
WILLOW,You are not in an institution. You have never been in an   institution.
BUFFY,"(whispers) Yes, I have."
WILLOW,What?
BUFFY,(sighs) Back when I saw my first vampires... (shot of the photo) I got so   scared. I told my parents ... and they completely freaked out. They thought   there was something seriously wrong with me. So they sent me to a   clinic.
WILLOW,(shocked) You never said anything.
BUFFY,"(tearful) I   was only there a couple of weeks. I stopped talking about it, and they let me   go. Eventually ... my parents just ... forgot."
WILLOW,God. That's   horrible.
BUFFY,(crying) What if I'm still there? What if I never left   that clinic?
WILLOW,"Buffy ... Buffy, you're not. (Buffy sniffling) I'm ...   so sorry you had to go through that. But, i-it's the past. You've got to trust   me. We're gonna get you that antidote. Xander's hunting the demon right now."
BUFFY,"Alone? Will, he can't. It's too strong."
WILLOW,"Oh, it's okay.   We got help."
SPIKE,"So, she's having the wiggins, is she? Thinks none of us are real.   Bloody self-centered, if you ask me."
XANDER,"Spike, we need muscle, not   color commentary."
SPIKE,"On the other hand, it might explain some things --   this all being in that twisted brain of hers. Yeah. Thinks up some chip in my   head. Make me soft, fall in love with her, then turn me into her soddin' sex   slave-"
XANDER,What?!
SPIKE,"Nothing. Alternative realities. Where we're   all little figments of Buffy's funny-farm delusion. You know, in a different   reality, you might not have left your bride at the altar. You might have gone   through with it like a man."
XANDER,"(annoyed) Okay, one more syllable about   Anya-"
SPIKE,"Oh, balls. You didn't say he was a glarghk guhl   kashma'nik(??)"
XANDER,'Cause I can't say glar-
XANDER,"I altered his reality. (pause) Get it, I... (sees Spike scowling)   Never mind."
Cut to,"Buffy sitting on her bed, staring blankly into space."
DAWN,(OS) I made you some tea.
BUFFY,(whispers) Thanks.
BUFFY,"(still staring vacantly) I'm okay, Dawn."
DAWN,"The, uh,   thousand-yard stare really helps sell that."
DAWN,You're burning up.
BUFFY,(frowns) I should be taller than   you.
DAWN,(small smile) Maybe you're not done growing.
BUFFY,Coming   apart.
DAWN,What's coming apart?
BUFFY,"(frowning, shaking her head) We   have to try harder, make things better."
DAWN,I'm trying.
BUFFY,"Your   grades ... stealing. (Dawn looking guilty) Willow's been doing your chores,   hasn't she?"
DAWN,"What? No, i-it's ... it's the fever. It's cooking your   brain."
BUFFY,"We have to deal with these things, Dawn, we-"
JOYCE VOICEOVER,"You   don't have a sister, Buffy."
BUFFY,(uncertainly) Dawn?
JOYCE,"No, honey."
JOYCE,Say it. It'll help you believe it.
BUFFY,"(uncertainly) I ...   don't ... have a sister. (Joyce nodding approvingly) I know I, I didn't grow   up with her. These monks, they-they made her."
HANK,"It's your mind, just playing tricks on you."
JOYCE,"You're our   little girl, Buffy. Our one and only. We've missed you so much. Mom and Dad   just want to take you home and take care of you."
DAWN,"(tearful) I'm not even there, am I?"
BUFFY,What?
DAWN,You said   it a second ago. You don't have a sister.
DAWN,"It's your ideal reality, and I'm not even a part of it."
BUFFY,"Dawn, I ... I didn't mean-"
DAWN,I have to go finish my chores.
XANDER,Hold it. Hold it!
WILLOW,I'll need its arm.
XANDER,"Yeah, I'd like both my arms too."
XANDER,"(getting up) Thanks, Spike. I'll help when the ... blistering pain   subsides."
WILLOW,Ready?
WILLOW,"(putting the spine in her jar) Xander, go to the magic shop."
WILLOW,I'll need alkanet root and a handful of nettle leaf. Just for the   medicinal properties. No magic.
WILLOW,"When you've got them, meet me at the campus lab. I'll see if I can   brew up an antidote the old-fashioned way."
SPIKE,"I'll hold here, keep an   eye on the wax job."
XANDER,Make sure that's all you're ogling.
WILLOW,Xander!
WILLOW,(OS) Buffy? Wake up.
WILLOW,Got yummy antidote goodness for you.
BUFFY,What happened?
WILLOW,"(gives her the mug) It took a little   longer than I'd hoped. No magic and all. Went boom twice, but then I got it.   Just ... when it's cool, drink it all down, and ... everything should go back   to normal."
BUFFY,"You never stop coming through. Thank you, Willow."
SPIKE,How is she?
WILLOW,(goes to the door) Make sure she drinks all   that. I'm gonna let Dawn know that everything's gonna be okay.
SPIKE,(quietly) You all right?
BUFFY,"(grimaces, not looking at him)   You need to leave me alone. You're not part of my life."
SPIKE,"(annoyed)   Fine, then."
SPIKE,"You know, but I hope you don't think this an-"
SPIKE,"(slightly calmer) I hope you don't think this antidote's gonna rid   you of that nasty martyrdom. (Buffy still not looking at him) See, I figured   it out, luv. You can't help yourself. You're not drawn to the dark like I   thought."
SPIKE,"You're addicted to the misery. It's why you won't tell your pals   about us. Might actually have to be happy if you did. They'd either understand   and help you, god forbid ... or drive you out ... where you can finally be at   peace, in the dark. With me. Either way, you'd be better off for it, but   you're too twisted for that. (pauses) Let yourself live, already. And stop   with the bloody hero trip for a sec. We'd all be the better for it."
SPIKE,You either tell your friends about us ... or I will.
DOCTOR VOICEOVER,Buffy.
BUFFY,(tearful) I don't wanna go back there.
BUFFY,I wanna be healthy again. (Joyce smiling hopefully. Buffy turns to   the doctor) What do I have to do?
BUFFY,"(anxious) Oh ... please, help me. (to Joyce) I-I   wanna go home, with you and dad."
JOYCE,"I know, Buffy. But first you've   gotta get better."
DOCTOR,"It's not gonna be easy, Buffy. You have to take   it one step at a time. You have to start ridding your mind of those things   that support your hallucinations. (Buffy looking up at him) You understand?   There are things in that world that you cling to. For your delusion, they're   safe-holds, but for your mind they're traps. We have to break those   down."
BUFFY,(softly) Slaying?
DOCTOR,Yes ... but I'm talking about   those things you want there. What keeps you going back.
BUFFY,My   friends.
DOCTOR,"That's right. Last summer, when you had a momentary   awakening, it was them that pulled you back in."
JOYCE,"They're not really   your friends, Buffy. They're just ... tricks keeping you from getting   healthy."
DOCTOR,"You have to do whatever it takes to convince yourself of   that, Buffy. Whatever it takes."
Flash back to the house. Buffy enters the living room and bumps into   Willow,
WILLOW,"(startled, nervous) Oh, Buffy, I, I didn't see you. I was just   coming to check on you. You feeling better? Did the antidote work?"
BUFFY,"I'm ... still pretty dazed, but, uh, better."
WILLOW,"No more cuckoo's nest?   (Buffy shakes her head) Well, we still have the big bad all tranked out down   in the basement. In case it didn't work and we need more parts."
WILLOW,It'll be nice to see you all better.
BUFFY,(small smile)   Thanks.
WILLOW,"I can make you some food, something big with energy, help   you clear your noggin. Come on."
XANDER,"(calls) Hello! I'm back! Clean and with the better smell now.   (comes inside, closes the door) Friends? Romans?"
XANDER,Anyone?
XANDER,Hey.
XANDER,"Hey, there, sane girl. (taking off his jacket) So did Willow get   that antidote to you all right?"
BUFFY,(curtly) Yeah. I'm better   now.
XANDER,"Great. So, it's settled. (puts down his jacket) We're, uh,   we're real, right? Guess we should finish off that demon and drag it out of   the basement. And tell me you're up for that. (shakes his head) I so don't   wanna see Spike right now. (walking closer to Buffy) I mean, talk about losing   touch. Hate to say it, but I almost... (frowns) feel sorry for the guy.   Almost. The things the poor guy was saying ... I mean, I get it, you know.   Been a part of the Buffy obsess-"
XANDER,(strained) B-Buffy-
XANDER,"(groggy) Willow, what..."
BUFFY,(calls) Dawn?
DAWN,Don't you knock? (resumes packing)
BUFFY,I called for you.
DAWN,"(looks at her again) Buffy, are you okay?"
BUFFY,Where are you   going?
DAWN,"(resumes packing) I'm going over to Janice's, where they   actually like having me around."
BUFFY,You're not going anywhere.
DAWN,(scoffs) Why not? You want me gone anyway. What do you care?
BUFFY,I care.   You're going downstairs with the others. It's the only way I can get healthy.   (walks toward Dawn)
DAWN,(alarmed) What are you talking about?
DAWN,"(worried) Buffy, you look sick. (Buffy just staring at her) What are   you doing? What's wrong with you?"
DAWN,Stay away from me!
DAWN,"(screams) Willow, help!"
DAWN,"Buffy, please!"
BUFFY,"You can't hide, Dawn."
DAWN,Talk to me. You're   hallucinating.
BUFFY,(leans against the door) I know. You're just a trap   for my mind.
DAWN,"Buffy, please, listen to me. That asylum and those   people, they're not real!"
DAWN,Buffy ... look at me. (Buffy blinking slowly) I'm right here. You're   my sister. (getting tearful) I need you and love you. Somewhere inside you   must know that's real.
BUFFY,(sarcastic) Sure it is. 'Cause what's more   real? (starts walking toward Dawn) A sick girl in an institution...
DAWN,Don't. Please. Listen to me.
BUFFY,"Or some kind of supergirl ... chosen to   ... fight demons and... (Dawn looking around anxiously) save the world.   (pauses, looks to one side, smiles a little) That's ridiculous."
BUFFY,"(advancing into the room as Dawn backs away) A girl who sleeps with   the vampire she hates?! Yeah, that makes sense."
DAWN,"No! Buffy, stop! I'm real!"
DAWN,"Buffy, stop it. I'll be good!"
DAWN,I promise. You're not thinking. I'll-
DOCTOR VOICEOVER,"It's okay, Buffy. Don't stress yourself."
JOYCE,"Honey, take your time."
DOCTOR,Make it as easy on yourself as   possible. There's nothing wrong with that.
XANDER,Buffy ... what are you doing?
