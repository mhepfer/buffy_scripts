Lyrics,<I>If I could walk out</I>
Lyrics,<I>You know I'd never lie</I>
Willow,"(smiles) Oz! Hey! Have a seat... Except, we don't have any  seats."
Oz,It's okay. I'll just scrunch in.
Cordelia,"Xander, why are you giving me a lap dance?"
Xander,(smiles weakly and strokes her arm) What? I just like you.
Willow,"(stammers, smiling nervously) And that's very beautiful. I  think it's great when two people like two people and want to be close to  them instead of anyone else."
Xander,"(also nervous) Here, here!"
Oz,"Yeah. Well put. (points at a cup) Hey, can I snag a sip?"
Willow,Sure. (reaches for her cup)
Xander,"(reaches also) Yeah, you got it."
Xander,"Thank you! (turns around) Thank you. (waves) Uh, we're here  through Saturday. Enjoy the veal. (smiles)"
Cordelia,Why are you guys so hyper?
Willow,"(nervously tries to cover) Hey! Speaking of people and things  they do that aren't like usual, anyone notice Buffy acting sort of  different?"
Xander,"Let's see, uh, killing zombies... uh, torching sewer monsters,  and... No, that's pretty much the, uh, (grins weakly) same old Buffster."
Willow,"(concerned) Well, I just mean, you know, she's off by herself a  lot more, and she's kind of... distracted."
Cordelia,(smiles) Think maybe she has a new honey?
Willow,A boyfriend? Why wouldn't she tell us?
Cordelia,"Excuse me? When your last steady killed half the class, and  then your rebound guy sends you a dump-o-gram? It makes a girl shy."
Xander,But we're the best of Buffy's bestest buds. She'd tell us.
Buffy,(arrives behind them) Tell you what?
Willow,"About your new boyfriend, who we made up. Unless we didn't?  (gives her an inquiring look)"
Buffy,(raises her eyebrows) This was a topic of discussion?
Oz,"Well, raised, but never discussed."
Cordelia,"So, are you dating somebody or not?"
Buffy,"I wouldn't use the word 'dating', (looks at them) but I am going  out with somebody. Tonight, as a matter of fact."
Willow,Really? Who?
Faith,"Yo, what's up? (nudges Buffy's shoulder) Hey, time to motorvate."
Buffy,"(puts her arm around Faith) Really, we're just good friends."
Buffy,Synchronized slaying.
Faith,New Olympic category?
Buffy,(to Giles) Whadaya think?
Gwendolyn,Sloppy.
Gwendolyn,"You telegraph punches, leave blind sides open and, uh, for a  school-night slaying, take entirely too much time. Which one of you is  Faith?"
Faith,Depends. Who the hell are you?
Gwendolyn,"Gwendolyn Post, Mrs. Your new Watcher."
Faith,"I'm telling you, I don't need a new Watcher. No offense, lady.  (Gwendolyn looks at her) I just have this problem with authority  figures. They end up kind of dead."
Gwendolyn,"(walking past the table) Duly noted, and fortunately, it's  not up to you."
Gwendolyn,"Mr. Giles, where do you keep the rest of your books?"
Giles,I-I'm sorry. (slips on his glasses) The rest?
Gwendolyn,"Yes, the actual library."
Gwendolyn,Oh. (smiles thinly) I see.
Giles,"I can assure you, Mrs. Post, this is the finest occult reference  collection..."
Gwendolyn,"(interrupts) ...this side of the Atlantic, I'm sure. Do you  have Hume's Paranormal Encyclopedia?"
Gwendolyn,The Labyrinth Maps of Malta?
Giles,It's on order.
Gwendolyn,"Well, I suppose that you have Sir Robert Kane's Twilight  Compendium?"
Giles,"Oh! Uh... (looks around) Yes, I... (spots the book) Yes! (pulls  it out) Yes, I do. (holds it up)"
Gwendolyn,(unimpressed) Of course you do. (paces past him) I have been  sent by the council for a very important reason. Faith needs a Watcher.  I am to act in that capacity and report back.
Faith,"(leans forward in her chair) Excuse me, Mary Poppins, you don't  seem to be listening."
Giles,"(interrupts) Faith, if the council feels that you need closer  observation, then... we will all, of course, cooperate."
Gwendolyn,"The council wishes me to report on the *entire* situation  here, (to Giles) including you."
Buffy,"Mm! Academic probation's not so funny today, huh, Giles? (rolls  her eyes innocently)"
Gwendolyn,"The fact is, there is talk in the council that you have  become a bit too... (inhales) American."
Giles,(taken aback) Me?
Buffy,(surprised) Him?
Gwendolyn,"A demon named Lagos is coming here to the Hellmouth.  (condescendingly) Mr. Giles, an illustration of Lagos, if you please."
Giles,"(a bit flustered) Oh, uh... (looks at the books on the table)  Yes. Uh..."
Gwendolyn,Perhaps later.
Gwendolyn,"Lagos seeks the Glove of Myhnegon. No record of this glove's  full power exists, but we do know it is highly dangerous and must not  fall into the hands of a demon. Lagos must be stopped."
Giles,What do you propose?
Gwendolyn,"Well, if it's not too radical a suggestion, I thought we  might kill him."
Gwendolyn,I suggest two Slayers at full strength for a coordinated  hunt.
Gwendolyn,"We believe the glove to be buried in a tomb somewhere, so  Lagos will be headed for the cemetery."
Giles,There is more than one in Sunnydale.
Gwendolyn,I see. How many?
Giles,"Uh, twelve, within the city limits."
Gwendolyn,"(takes a deep breath) Well, we'll just have to take them one  at a time."
Gwendolyn,"Anything in your books that might pinpoint the exact  location of the tomb would be useful, but then, we cannot ask for  miracles."
Gwendolyn,"We will begin tomorrow at sunset. Faith... (Faith almost  startles) With me, please."
Giles,That was bracing.
Buffy,Interesting lady. Can we kill her?
Giles,(lowers his fist) I think the council might frown upon that.
Giles,Well... (stands up) How do you feel about a spot of training?
Buffy,Uhh... I gotta go. Big night for us Slayer types.
Buffy,"People to see, demons to kill. (starts to leave) Better hurry  before somebody figures out what we're doing."
Angel,(pulls on his shirt) What are we doing?
Buffy,(stops) Training. (quietly) And almost kissing.
Buffy,"Sorry. It's just... (smiles weakly) old habit. (loses the smile)  Bad, bad habit to be broken."
Angel,It's hard.
Buffy,It's not hard. (with resolve) Cold turkey. That's the key to  quitting.
Buffy,(weakly and desperately) You think they make a patch for this?
Angel,You have to go.
Buffy,I really do.
Buffy,"I'm gonna try and vent a little hormonal angst by going out  there and killing a Lagos, whatever that is."
Angel,Lagos?
Buffy,"Some demon looking for some all-powerful thingamabob, (Angel  sits, suddenly worried) and I gotta stop him before he unleashes unholy  havoc, (sees his worried look) and it's another Tuesday night in  Sunnydale."
Angel,Be careful.
Giles,"Oh, this is intolerable. (slams the book shut) There's not a  word here about Lagos or the glove. (stands up) We don't have time for  this (drops the book in frustration) near-missing. (turns to Willow and  Xander) Just find out all you can about the demon, its-its-its  strengths, its-its weaknesses, (begins to pace) its places of origin,  (stops and yanks off his glasses) and most importantly, (points at  Xander with his glasses) what it plans to do with this blasted glove."
Xander,"(gives Giles an annoyed smile) Hey, you're not the Watcher of  me."
Giles,"Then go home. But if you choose to stay, then work."
Willow,"Ugh... It's late. I'm tired. What does he want from us, anyway?"
Xander,The number of a qualified surgeon to remove the British flag  from his butt?
Willow,My eyes are all blurry.
Willow,Ohh...
Willow,"Oh, stop."
Xander,"Right. (continues rubbing) Stop means no... (keeps rubbing) And  no means no, so, um... (finally stops) stop."
Giles,"Willow, Xander..."
Giles,"...you can stop your, uh, studying."
Giles,I've got what I need.
Xander,(trying to be cool) What have you got?
Giles,"Uh, the probable location of the Glove of Myhnegon. (faces them)  It's, uh, housed in the Von Hauptman family crypt."
Xander,"Yeah, that's that big one over at the Restfield Cemetery."
Willow,"Yeah, well, that's great, Giles. Um, how'd you find it?"
Giles,I looked. (continues his reading)
Xander,Where's Buffy at?
Giles,"Uh, I'm not sure."
Xander,"Well, I'll go check out this, uh, crypt. (starts out) Um, tell  her heads-up if she, uh, stops by. (leaves)"
Giles,"Yes, by all means, go."
Willow,(nervously) A-and I'll just keep studying. I think we're on the  verge of a big Lagos breakthrough.
Giles,"(looks up from his book) No, I'd say we're done."
Faith,"Ronnie, deadbeat. Steve, klepto. Kenny... drummer. Eventually, I  just had to face up to my destiny as a loser magnet. Now it's strictly  get some, get gone. You can't trust guys."
Buffy,"You can trust some guys. (gets a doubtful look from Faith)  Really, I've read about them."
Faith,"(laughs) Yeah. So, what about you?"
Buffy,"You mean like, me and guys me?"
Faith,Mm-hm.
Buffy,Not much to tell these days.
Faith,"Yeah, but you gotta have stories. I mean, I've had my share of  losers, but you... you boinked the undead. What was that like?"
Buffy,Life with Angel's... was complicated. It's still a little hard  for me to talk about.
Faith,"Well, try."
Buffy,"Look, Faith, all the Angel issues are still kind of with me, so  if you don't mind, I'd rather not."
Faith,"(shrugs) Yeah. (shrugs) Yeah, whatever."
Faith,You know what? We're oh for six tonight. Why don't we just blow  this off?
Buffy,Yeah. I am kinda beat. But-but Shady Hill's pretty close.
Faith,I'll swing through it. It's on my way anyway.
Buffy,Alone? I-I don't know if I'd...
Faith,I got Miss Priss on my back now. I don't need another baby- sitter. I'll holler if I'm having any fun.
Buffy,(smiles thinly) Okay.
Faith,(nods down the street) Later. (goes)
Buffy,Thanks.
Faith,(to herself) Son of a bitch. It's my lucky day.
Xander,"(smiling, dripping with sarcasm) Hey, Giles, here's a nifty  idea: why don't I alleviate my guilt by goin' out and gettin' myself  really, really killed?"
Buffy,"Oh, God..."
Angel,(confused) Buffy...
Buffy,What am I doing? (looks up at him) What are *you* doing?
Angel,(still confused) I don't know.
Buffy,Shame on you!
Buffy,"Oh, God, I... I don't even know why I came back here."
Angel,It's good you did.
Angel,I think I have what you're looking for.
Buffy,"Great... Just, wherever this was gift-wrapped, remind me not to  shop there."
Angel,Glove of Myhnegon.
Buffy,The world's ugliest fashion accessory.
Angel,"No, don't. Once you put it on, the glove can never be removed."
Buffy,"So... no touching. (nods, looks at their hands) Kinda like us."
Buffy,You hold on to it. I'll... I'll tell Giles in the morning. At  least he'll be happy.
Giles,Ah! Yes. There we are.
Giles,There's a wood engraving. See? The Glove of Myhnegon.
Gwendolyn,"(looks at it, unimpressed) Yes, engraved by Father Theodore  of Wolsham."
Giles,Yes.
Gwendolyn,"Based, I believe, on very sketchy and unreliable folk  legends. The pictures are fun to look at, Mr. Giles, but one really  ought to read the nice words as well."
Giles,"Ah. (stands up) Yes. (puts his hands in his pockets) Some tea,  perhaps?"
Gwendolyn,"I know that you must find me tiresome, but it's insidious,  really."
Gwendolyn,"A person slips up on the little things, and soon everything  has gone to Hell in a handbasket."
Gwendolyn,"For example... Buffy, your Slayer..."
Giles,"(struggling to control his voice) Mrs. Post... (pours her hot  water) I can assure you that Buffy is both dedicated and industrious,  and I am in complete control of my Slayer."
Xander,Giles! We have a big problem. It's Buffy.
Giles,Will you excuse us?
Gwendolyn,Would you like some assistance?
Giles,(smiling thinly) Thank you. That won't be necessary.
Buffy,Lagos is out of luck. I got the magic mitten thingy.
Buffy,What's with all the tragedy masks?
Giles,"(indicates a chair) Better take a seat, Buffy."
Buffy,What's going on? (sits)
Giles,We know Angel is alive. (Buffy looks shocked) Xander saw you  with him. It would appear that you've been hiding him and that you lied  to us.
Willow,"Nobody's here to blame you, Buffy. But this is serious. You  need help."
Buffy,(looks up at Willow) It's not what you think.
Xander,Hope not. Because I think you're harboring a vicious killer.
Willow,"(trying to mediate) This isn't about attacking Buffy. Remember,  'I' statements only. 'I feel angry.' 'I feel worried.'"
Cordelia,"Fine. Here's one: I feel worried... about me! Last time  around, Angel barely laid a hand on Buffy. He was *way* more interested  in killing her friends."
Buffy,But he's better now.
Xander,"Better for how long, Buffy? I mean, did you even think about  that?"
Buffy,"(stands up) What is this, Demons Anonymous? (starts to leave) I  don't need an intervention, here."
Giles,"Oh, don't you? (Buffy stops and faces him) You must've known it  was wrong seeing Angel or you wouldn't have hidden it from all of us."
Buffy,"(desperate and defensive) I was going to tell you, I was. I-it  was just that I... I didn't know why he came back. I just wanted to  wait."
Xander,For what? For Angel to go psycho again the next time you give  him a happy?
Buffy,(raising her voice defensively) I'm not going to... (raises her  hand to him) We're not together like that.
Oz,But you were kissing him.
Buffy,You were spying on me? (steps toward him) What gives you the  right?
Cordelia,What gives you the right to suck face with your demon lover  again?
Buffy,(defensive again) It was an accident.
Xander,"What, you just tripped and fell on his lips?"
Buffy,"It was wrong, okay? I know that, and I know that it can't happen  again. But you guys have to believe me. I would never put you in any  danger. If I thought for a second that Angel was going to hurt anyone..."
Xander,...you would stop him. Like you did last time with Ms.  Calendar.
Willow,"(nervously) Buffy, I feel that when it comes to Angel, you  can't see straight. And that's why we're, we're all gonna help you face  this."
Buffy,"But he's better now. I swear. Look, you guys, he's the one that  found the Glove of Myhnegon. H-he's keeping it safe for us in the  mansion."
Xander,"(spreads his arms) Right! Great plan. Leave tons of firepower  with the Scary Guy, and leave us to clean up the mess."
Buffy,"You would just love an excuse to hurt him, wouldn't you?"
Xander,I don't need an excuse. I think lots of dead people actually  constitutes a reason.
Buffy,Right. This is all nobility. This has nothing to do with  jealousy.
Cordelia,Hello? Miss Not-Over-Yourself-Yet?
Buffy,(shakes her head in warning) Don't you start with me.
Willow,"(upset) Giles, no one's doing the 'I' statements!"
Giles,"That's enough! Everybody. Now, Buffy knows our concerns, and her  actions, however ill-advised, can be understood. (Cordelia shakes her  head) Our... priority right now is to retrieve the Glove of Myhnegon and  try to destroy it. Now, all of you, back to classes."
Buffy,(uneasily) Thanks for the bail in there.
Buffy,"I know this is a lot to absorb, but Angel did find the glove,  and that was a good..."
Giles,"(interrupts) Be quiet. (slowly turns to face her) (sternly) I  won't remind you that the fate of the world often lies with the Slayer.  What would be the point? Nor shall I remind you that you've jeopardized  the lives of all that you hold dear by harboring a known murderer. But  sadly, I must remind you that Angel tortured me... for hours... for  pleasure. You should have told me he was alive. You didn't. You have no  respect for me, or the job I perform."
Gwendolyn,A word of advice? Vampires rarely knock. Especially in  daylight. (closes the door)
Faith,"Oh, right."
Gwendolyn,(looks around) So... this is your home.
Faith,Yeah. (gestures around the room) The decorator actually just  left.
Gwendolyn,"Faith, do you know who the Spartans were? (leans against the  dresser)"
Faith,Wild stab: a bunch of guys from Spart? (sits on the bed)
Gwendolyn,"They were the fiercest warriors known to Ancient Greece. And  they lived in quarters very much like these. Do you know why? Because a  true fighter needs nothing else. I'm going to be very hard on you,  Faith. I will not brook insolence or laziness. And I will not allow  blunders like last night's attack. You will probably hate me a great  deal of the time."
Faith,(smiles sardonically) You think?
Gwendolyn,"(steps over to the bed) But I will make you a better Slayer,  (sits next to Faith) and that will keep you alive. You have to trust  that I am right. God only knows what Mr. Giles has been filling your  head with."
Faith,Giles is okay.
Gwendolyn,(stands) His methods are unfathomable to me. I find him  entirely confounding. But that is not important. Let him have his games  and secret meetings.
Faith,What meetings?
Gwendolyn,"Oh, I don't know. Something with Buffy and her friends."
Faith,"Oh, right. I guess that doesn't include me."
Gwendolyn,And why does he let her socialize so much? It hardly  seems... No matter. Would you like to do some training?
Faith,Training? (stands up) As in kicking and punching and stabbing?
Gwendolyn,"(smiles) Yes, that's the idea."
Faith,I'm your girl.
Buffy,Hey.
Willow,Hey! (continues gathering her stuff)
Buffy,"So on a scale of one to a million, how much are you hating me  right now?"
Willow,"(jumpy, trying to hide her feelings) Zero. You were scared, you  kept a secret, you know? (zips closed her backpack) That's-it-it's okay.  I mean, secrets aren't bad. You know, they're normal. (slips her pack  onto her shoulder) They're better than normal. They're good. Secrets are  good. Must be a reason why we keep them, right? (closes her locker)"
Buffy,"Yeah, I guess."
Willow,"So, are you going to the Bronze tonight, or, uh, are you gonna  sneak away for a not-so-secret rendezvous with Angel?"
Buffy,None of the above. I'm gonna try and kill this Lagos guy. Peace  offering to Giles.
Willow,"Well, Angel has the glove now, right?"
Buffy,Yep. But Lagos doesn't know that. I figure sooner or later he's  bound to show up at that crypt looking for it.
Willow,"Ah, but instead he finds a Buffy in a not-so-good mood."
Buffy,That's my brilliant plan.
Faith,You look pissed.
Xander,Rough day. (chooses his shot)
Faith,Tell me about it.
Xander,(places the cue ball) Rather just shoot. (aims his cue stick)
Faith,Don't think I don't know what you and your pals were talking  about behind my back today.
Xander,(takes his shot) Yeah? And what was that? (looks for his next  shot)
Faith,More about this glove deal than you're saying.
Xander,The Glove of Myhnegon? Right. (aims his cue stick) How'd you  like a hit of some real news: Angel's still alive.
Faith,The vampire.
Xander,Back in town. Saw him myself. Toting the popular and famous  glove.
Faith,Angel.
Faith,"Guy like that, with that kind of glove, could kill a whole mess  of people."
Xander,Said the same thing to Buffy myself. Weird how she didn't seem  to care. (aims for his next shot)
Faith,Buffy knew he was alive.
Faith,I can't believe her.
Xander,(walks around the table) She says he's clean.
Faith,"Yeah, well, I say we can't afford to find out. (has Xander's  full attention) I say I deal with this problem right now. I say I slay."
Xander,Can I come?
Gwendolyn,"You wanted to see me, Mr. Giles?"
Giles,(grabs his coat) Yes. I do apologize for bringing you in at this  late hour. (pulls it on)
Gwendolyn,Please. A good Watcher must be awake and alert at all hours.
Giles,Would you like some tea?
Gwendolyn,"God, yes, please. I'm completely knackered. (goes to Giles'  chair) I spent the afternoon training with Faith. (sits) She doesn't  lack for energy."
Giles,"(chuckles) She's your first Slayer, I take it?"
Gwendolyn,If you're questioning my qualifications...
Giles,"No, I'm not. (pours water from the kettle into his teapot) I,  uh, have the utmost respect for your methods... (faces her, holding the  teapot) in my own American way. (leans against his desk) I also have the  glove. (Gwendolyn looks at him expectantly) Oh, not actually on me, but,  uh, I believe it's safe. It's in a mansion on Crawford Street. A-a-a  friend of Buffy's is keeping it there."
Gwendolyn,(stands up) Well. We must get to it. Immediately. Hide it  before someone else finds it.
Giles,"Or better still, destroy it."
Gwendolyn,(surprised) Destroy it?
Giles,"(stands up and sets down the teapot) Yes, I-I... I didn't think  it could be done either, but... (goes to his desk for a book) It  involves transforming fire (show her the book) into Living Flame and  immolating the glove."
Giles,"I-i-it's complex, but, uh, I believe I have all the necessary  materials."
Gwendolyn,"Well, (puts the book down) I must say, Mr. Giles... Good  show."
Gwendolyn,Good show indeed.
Willow,"Um, not to downplay my own slaying abilities, which in some  circles are considered formidable, but shouldn't Faith be here?"
Buffy,"I tried calling, but no one was home. Look, if you're feeling  any demon-o-phobia, please, splitting is totally an option. You're not  the one in trouble with Giles."
Willow,That's true. (continues pacing)
Buffy,"How long do you think he can stay angry at me, anyway?"
Willow,The emotional marathon man? (shrugs)
Buffy,"Yeah. I can't really blame him. It's weird, though. Now that my  secret... Angel, it's all out in the open... I feel better."
Willow,"Well, *sure* you do. This big burden's been lifted. I mean,  keeping secrets is a lot of work. (stops pacing) One could  hypothetically imagine."
Buffy,You have no idea.
Willow,"(laughs uneasily) None whatsoever. But... (sits next to Buffy)  Can I ask you a question? (Buffy nods) When you were with Angel and  nobody knew about it, did that make it feel, you know, sexier somehow?"
Buffy,"Not really. It's too much pressure. After a while, it even makes  the fun parts... not so fun."
Willow,(disappointed) Oh.
Buffy,"(wondering what's up) What makes you think all this secret stuff  is sexy, anyway?"
Willow,(nervously defensive) Nothing. I'm just wondering. Gotta keep  asking the big old questions when you're blessed with this girl's thirst  for knowledge and... (gives in) Okay. There's something I have to tell  you.
Buffy,What?
Willow,"(gets up) Okay. This will make me feel better, right? You know,  I always consider myself a good person. Floss, do my homework, never  cheat. But lately, and please don't judge me on this, but I want you to  be the first to know that, that... (sees Lagos) there's a demon behind  you."
Willow,Don't...
Buffy,Now we're talking.
Willow,Yes!
Buffy,"Sorry about that. So, what were you saying?"
Willow,"Oh, I... (decides against a confession) I opened my SAT test  booklet five minutes early. (Buffy gives her a blank look) Just doesn't  seem important now, does it?"
Buffy,(smiles) Your secret's safe with me. (looks at Lagos' body) Come  on. Let's go bring Giles some happiness.
Xander,"Good old Sunnydale library. Fully equipped with reference  books, file cards... (opens the cabinet doors) and weapons."
Faith,Beauty. (reaches in)
Xander,I call crossbow. (reaches for it)
Faith,You got it.
Xander,"All right, ready to go?"
Faith,That I am.
Xander,Wait.
Faith,What?
Xander,"Oh, my God. It's Giles! (holds his head) Giles, can you hear  me? (looks around) What the hell happened?"
Faith,"Gee, let me guess."
Xander,(trying not to panic) Stop. Hold it. Just think a minute.
Faith,"Yeah, I'm thinking. Thinking Buffy's ex-meat did this."
Xander,(grabs the phone) It's not Angel's style. (dials 911)
Faith,The guy's a demon! How much more proof do you need?
Xander,"Bite marks would be nice. (into the phone) Yeah, I have a  medical emergency. Sunnydale High."
Faith,Screw this waiting crap. (starts to go)
Xander,"Faith, if we leave, Giles could die!"
Faith,"(from the checkout counter) Yeah, and he's gonna have a whole  lot of company, unless *I* do something permanent. (starts to go again)"
Xander,Wait!
Faith,"For what? You to grow a pair? You handle the baby-sit, and I'm  gonna kill Angel. (strides out)"
Xander,Damn it!
Angel,"Exorere, Flamma Vitae. Prodi ex loco tuo elementorum, in hunc  mundum vivorum."
Translation,"Arise, Flame of Life. Come forth from your place of the  elements, into this world of the living."
Angel,"Exorere, Flamma Vitae. Prodi ex loco tuo elementorum, in hunc  mundum vivorum."
Translation,"Arise, Flame of Life. Come forth from your place of the  elements, into this world of the living."
Buffy,Giles is gonna be psyched that we showed up stuffy old Mrs.  Post.
Buffy,"Oh, my God. (runs to Giles' side)"
Paramedic,(into her radio) Sunnydale Medical...
Buffy,What happened?
Paramedic,"(into her radio) ...Caucasian male, mid-forties..."
Buffy,Giles...
Paramedic,"...blunt object head trauma. Notify ER, we're bringing him  in."
Buffy,What happened?
Paramedic,No time for this. (starts to wheel him out)
Giles,"(feebly) Wait... (the paramedics stop) Buffy, you must... must  destroy the glove."
Paramedic,(sternly) You want him to live? Get out of the way.
Giles,Use... Living... Flame...
Paramedic,Move!
Buffy,What happened?
Xander,Your boyfriend's not as cured as you thought.
Buffy,What makes you think that Angel had anything to do with this?
Xander,We saw what you saw.
Buffy,So you just assume?
Xander,I didn't. Faith did.
Buffy,(very worried) What did you tell her?
Xander,Only what everyone knows. She's a big girl. Came to her own  conclusions.
Buffy,(angry) How much of a head start does she have?
Xander,Ten minutes.
Buffy,(steps over to Willow) Go through Giles' research. Figure out  how to destroy the glove.
Willow,Shut up and help me.
Angel,What do you want?
Gwendolyn,Gwen Post. Mr. Giles sent me.
Angel,What for?
Gwendolyn,To help you destroy the glove. (looks at the urn) Is that  the Living Flame?
Angel,Yes.
Gwendolyn,"(goes to the table by the urn) Look, I'm sorry to be so  abrupt, but Lagos is on his way here now. (looks it over) If you're  performing the ritual incorrectly, it will only make the glove more  powerful."
Angel,Alright. (steps up to the flame)
Gwendolyn,Good. Where is the glove?
Angel,It's in the trunk.
Gwendolyn,That's what I love about this town. Everyone's so helpful.
Gwendolyn,Bugger.
Gwendolyn,Bugger!
Angel,Okay...
Angel,That hurt.
Gwendolyn,"(holds the shovel defensively) It was supposed to kill you.  If you'd been human, it would have. But... (breaks the handle over her  knee) I believe this is your poison."
Faith,Mrs. Post!
Faith,(intensely angry) I can't believe how much I'm gonna kill you.
Angel,(stands his ground) You're *not* getting that glove.
Faith,You wanna bet?
Faith,(very confused) What?
Xander,Think we got it?
Willow,"Well, it's either the catalyst for Living Flame or just some  really smelly sand. (looks at Xander, worried) We'll have to test this."
Xander,I'll double-check.
Willow,What?
Xander,I know what the glove does.
Willow,There's no time to test this.
Buffy,"I can't let you do it, Faith."
Faith,"You're confused, Twinkie. (smiles ironically) Let me clear you  up. (points at Angel) Vampire. (points at herself) Slayer. (points at  Angel again) Dead vampire."
Buffy,There's a lot that you don't understand.
Gwendolyn,(groggy) Faith...
Gwendolyn,(weak from her fight) She doesn't know. She's blinded by  love.
Buffy,"Faith, no."
Gwendolyn,Trust me.
Buffy,"(drops her guard) Faith, we can figure this out..."
Faith,Auuuugh!
Gwendolyn,The glove! It's in the trunk.
Xander,(reassuringly) We'll get it.
Gwendolyn,(to Xander) Help Faith.
Xander,"What are you... (sees them faced off again and gets between  them) Stop! Guys, listen!"
Gwendolyn,(smiling wickedly) Finally.
Gwendolyn,Taou huogan maqachte milegaing!
Translation,"Be mine, the power of Myhnegon!"
Faith,What's going on?
Gwendolyn,(smiling maliciously) Faith! A word of advice: you're an  idiot.
Gwendolyn,Tauo freim!
Translation,Be free!
Gwendolyn,Tauo freim!
Translation,Be free!
Gwendolyn,Tauo freim!
Translation,Be free!
Buffy,(to Faith) Can you draw her fire?
Faith,You bet I can.
Buffy,Go do it.
Gwendolyn,Tauo freim!
Translation,Be free!
Gwendolyn,There's nothing you can do to me now.
Gwendolyn,I have the glove. With the glove comes the power.
Buffy,I'm getting that.
Cordelia,So there's no more glove thingy?
Xander,"No. Little Living Flame, little mesquite, gone for good."
Oz,Sounds like we missed a lot of fun.
Xander,Then we're telling it wrong.
Willow,What do you think Buffy and Angel are gonna do?
Xander,"Boy, do I don't know. (nods)"
Willow,"Well, he saved me from a horrible flamey death. That sort of  makes me like him again. (smiles thinly)"
Xander,"Well, as long as she and Angel don't get pelvic, we'll be okay,  I guess."
Buffy,What are you guys talking about?
Oz,"Oddly enough, your boyfriend. Again."
Buffy,"(looks down sadly) He's not my boyfriend. (sits next to Xander)  Really, truly, he's... (sighs) I don't know."
Buffy,(hesitatingly) Are we cool?
Xander,"Yeah! Just seeing the two of you kissing after everything that  happened, I leaned toward the postal. (pauses) But I trust you."
Cordelia,I don't. Just for the record.
Buffy,Let me guess: Gwendolyn Post: not a Watcher.
Giles,"Yes, she was. (cautiously takes the steps) She was, uh, kicked  out by the council a couple of years ago for misuses of dark power. They  swear there was a memo."
Buffy,"Well, I better go. (to Xander) Little more damage control."
Willow,(sighs) The whole Angel thing is so weird.
Giles,"(slowly sits next to Xander) Yes, well, we'll have to see how  that unfolds, won't we?"
Man,"<I>Yes, sir?</I>"
Friday,"<I>Police officers. My name's Friday, this is...</I>"
Man,<I>How are you?</I>
Faith,Come in.
Buffy,Hey.
Man,"<I>Called the police just a little while ago. Talked to a man down  there. I didn't get his name, though.</I>"
Buffy,The place looks nice.
Faith,"Yeah, it's real Spartan."
Friday,"<I>Can you show us where they broke in, please?</I>"
Buffy,How are you?
Faith,Five-by-five.
Buffy,I'll interpret that as good.
Buffy,"Look, Gwendolyn Post, or whoever she may be, had us all fooled.  Even Giles."
Faith,"(without looking up) Yeah, well, you can't trust people. I  should've learned that by now."
Buffy,I realize this is gonna sound funny coming from someone that  just spent a lot of time kicking your face... but you can trust me.
Faith,"(looks up, amused) Is that right? (tosses the magazine aside)"
Buffy,"I know I kept secrets, but I didn't have a choice. I'm on your  side."
Faith,"*I'm* on my side, (nods) and that's enough."
Buffy,(shakes her head) Not always.
Faith,(shrugs) Is that it?
Buffy,"Yeah, I guess."
Faith,"Alright. Well, then, I'll see you."
Faith,"Uh, Buffy?"
Buffy,(faces her expectantly) Yeah?
Faith,Nothing.
