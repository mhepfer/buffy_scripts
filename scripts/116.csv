SPIKE,"Buffy. If I'd-a known you were coming, I'd-a baked a cake."
BUFFY,Tell me you love me.
SPIKE,I love you.
BUFFY,Tell me you want me.
SPIKE,I always want you.
XANDER,"Anya, you wanna marry me?"
ANYA,Yes.
XANDER,We're getting married.
BUFFY,Congratulations.
XANDER,"Wedding. One week. We have friends, family, demons flying in, a to-do list getting no shorter."
TARA,"Can, can we not do this now?"
TARA,I don't think this is gonna work.
WILLOW,Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
DAWN,Big wedding coming up ... you and Tara are speaking again. You wanna call her? Invite her over?
WILLOW,"Oh, no. Too soon for so bold a maneuver. Buffy and Spike in the crypt."
BUFFY,It's over.
SPIKE,"I've memorized this tune, luv."
BUFFY,"I'm using you. And it's killing me. I'm sorry, William."
HALFREK,I know there's been a lot of loss.
DAWN,"People have a tendency to go away, and sometimes I wish I could just make them stop."
HALFREK,Wish granted.
WILLOW,"(horrified) Buffy, it's hideous. Oh my god, Buffy. Look at its arms!"
BUFFY,(nods bravely) I know. But it's my duty.
BUFFY,"I'm ... Buffy the bridesmaid. (flash of lightning, clap of thunder)"
WILLOW,(disgusted) Duty-schmuty. I'm supposed to be best man. Shouldn't I be all ... Marlene Dietrich-y in a dashing tuxedo number?
BUFFY,No.
WILLOW,Oh. (pouts)
BUFFY,That would be totally unfair. We must share equally in the cosmic joke that is bridesmaids-dom.
WILLOW,"(whining) Well, maybe ... if I ask Anya, I can still go with the traditional ... blood larva and burlap. (Buffy putting on earrings) I mean, she was a, a vengeance demon for like a thousand years, she would know all the most flattering ... larvae. (makes a face) What was she thinking?"
BUFFY,I think she's probably too stressed to be thinking right now. What with Xander's relatives and her ... demons.
WILLOW,"Oh my god, last night, that rehearsal dinner. That was like a, a zoo without the table manners. And I bet it got worse after we left."
BUFFY,I just can't believe everyone bought that story about Anya's people being circus folk. Did you see the guy with the tentacles? What's he supposed to be? Inky the Squid Boy?
WILLOW,"And Xander's family. I haven't seen them that bad since my bat mitzvah. Ugh, did you see how much they drank?"
BUFFY,Kinda. Mr. Harris threw up in my purse.
ANYA,Oh!
ANYA,Ohh. (sighs) You guys look so beautiful!
ANYA,This is the happiest day of my whole life!
VOICEOVER,"You seen my cuff-links, Uncle Rory?"
XANDER,"Little metal deals, hold my sleeves together? (holds up his hands so we can see the open cuffs)"
RORY,"Ah, you don't want those. What you really want is Velcro. Did I ever tell you how that was my idea?"
KRELVIN,"'Scuse me, coming through."
KRELVIN,(to Xander) Hey.
XANDER,Hey!
KRELVIN,How you doin'?
XANDER,Good.
XANDER,Rory? Whatcha doin' there?
RORY,"(bending over, fiddling with the coffee machine) Well, I'm trying to make myself an Irish coffee, but this stupid thing is on the fritz."
XANDER,"Yeah, uh, watch it, it's still plugged in."
RORY,Gotcha.
KRELVIN,"(closing fridge) Oh, is, is that broken? You want me to take a look at that?"
RORY,"Knock yourself out there, Kevin. (moves the coffee maker to the edge of the counter)"
KRELVIN,"Uh, it's, uh, Krelvin."
RORY,"Right, right. Krelvin."
HARRIS,Whoo! (waving at everyone)
HARRIS,"(tapping his watch) Xander, you're not ready yet? (Xander rolling his eyes)"
HARRIS,"Look at my hair. (looking at her reflection in a compact) Of course, I suppose it doesn't really matter, 'cause I won't actually be in any of the pictures."
XANDER,"(exasperated) You'll be in the pictures, Mom."
KRELVIN,I think your hair looks lovely. (resumes examining the coffee machine)
HARRIS,Oh.
XANDER,"Hey, hey, how's about some breakfast? (Uncle Rory walks by, gives Xander's Dad a coffee mug)"
HARRIS,"Oh, well, I guess if I'm a little plump it doesn't matter, since I won't really be-"
XANDER,"You'll be in the pictures, Mom!"
HARRIS,"(gestures with coffee cup toward Krelvin) That's one of hers, right? (to Krelvin) Hey. You're one of hers, right?"
XANDER,"You met Krelvin already, Dad. Last night."
KRELVIN,"Yeah. Yeah, uh, we met. You, uh, you said I resembled your mother-in-law."
HARRIS,Tony!
HARRIS,"(remembering) Oh, yeah."
KRELVIN,"And then, you hit me with a cocktail wiener, and then you insulted my heritage."
HARRIS,"Heritage? Being circus folks is suddenly heritage now? I mean no disrespect, of course. (shot of Xander looking resigned as his mother buttons his shirt) I'm sure you come from a long, proud line of geeks."
HARRIS,I'm kidding. Just kidding.
CAROL,Xander? Xander!
CAROL,"(softly) You know that guy Kevin? If he could clear up the skin problem... do you think... (sighs) Do you suppose he'd date a woman with a kid? (Xander staring at her) I mean, I really can't afford to be very picky."
XANDER,Cousin Carol? Your earrings are my cufflinks.
CAROL,They are? (puts hands to her ears) Oh my. Oops.
XANDER,Excellent. (calls toward the others) Cufflinks: check. We're rolling. Nothing on earth can stop this wedding now.
to,"exterior Sunnydale, business district. It's pouring rain. The streets are deserted. Suddenly the outline of a man appears, in red, walking. It turns into an actual man. He is elderly, wears a raincoat and holds an umbrella. He pauses, looks around, opens the umbrella and holds it over his head, resumes walking. Lightning flashes, thunder rumbles."
XANDER,(panting) Is it too small?
BUFFY,(unconvincingly) Nah.
XANDER,(nervous) It fit when I picked up the tux. How could it not fit now?
BUFFY,(pulling) It'll fit.
XANDER,"Aw, man, what if it doesn't? (looking at himself in a mirror) What if I can't wear my cummerbund, (panicking) and then the whole world can see the place where my pants meet my shirt? Buffy, that can NOT happen. I must wear das cummerbund!"
BUFFY,(strained) And so... you... shall!
XANDER,"Hey, you got it! (turning to face her)"
BUFFY,(smiling) Slayer strength.
XANDER,And I've been meaning to cut back on that habit-forming oxygen.
BUFFY,"Look at you. You look great, Mr. About-To-Get-Married. (smiling) Glowing."
BUFFY,Oh my god! Maybe you're pregnant!
XANDER,(grins) Maybe. I dunno. Maybe I'm just happy.
XANDER,(concerned) Teary.
BUFFY,Oh! (sniffles) Good. Good teary.
XANDER,Happy teary? Not frustrated with bow-tie teary?
BUFFY,"(still fiddling with bow tie) Yes. Happy. Happy for you. That makes me happy for me. You and Anya give me hope. It's like ... you two are proof that there's light at the end of this very long, long, nasty tunnel. And, I cannot tie this tie. Isn't, where's your best man, isn't she supposed to do this?"
XANDER,"Well, she said she had something important to do."
to,"close shot of Anya's waist, wearing bridal gown. Hands attempting to button the tiny buttons all up the back of the gown."
WILLOW,Want me to hold it shut for you?
TARA,O-okay.
ANYA,(OS) Are you guys even listening?
ANYA,"I need feedback, people."
TARA,Sorry. Please continue with the vows. (smiling at Willow)
ANYA,"(clears throat) 'I, Anya, promise to ... love you, to cherish you, (Willow kneeling down to work on the dress) ...to honor you, uh, but not to obey you, of course, because that's anachronistic and misogynistic and who do you think you are, like a sea captain or something?'"
ANYA,"'However, I do entrust you with...' (pauses, hears the others chuckling) What? Is something funny?"
TARA,"No, n-nothing, sweetie, just, just keep still. (smiling at Willow)"
ANYA,"(clears throat) Okay. Blah, blah, blah, misogynistic. Blah, blah, 'I do however entrust you ... um, with my heart. Take care of my heart, won't you please? Take care of it because, it's all that I have. And, if you let me, I'll take care of your heart too.'"
ANYA,"'I'll protect it and tend to it, like a little stray.' Wait, no. 'Like a, a little mangy stray that needs a home.' (Willow and Tara amused again) No, that's not it either."
TARA,Um... (clears throat) I think we're all set here. Let's ... take a look at you.
TARA,Oh.
WILLOW,Wow. You look lovely. Really... lovely.
ANYA,"Thanks. It's probably the blush of imprudent spending. Do you think Xander will like it? (turns back to them, nervously) Oh, I want to see Xander now!"
WILLOW,"You can't. It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride in her dress, remember?"
ANYA,"Right. I can't keep all these ridiculous traditions straight. What if I'm not wearing my dress when I see him? (Willow giving her a scolding look) Okay, no sex. Cuddling? (Willow and Tara giggling) Okay. It's just I'm so excited and I want to share it all with my best friend. (excited) I get to be with my best friend forever! (squealing) Yay!"
to,"exterior shot of the wedding location. The sign above the doors reads: ""Sunnydale Bison's Lodge."" Cars are pulling up, people are walking in the two sets of double-doors. It's still raining and the guests have umbrellas, etc."
RORY,Guess who agreed to be my date for tonight.
CATERER,I'm really supposed to be working. I'm one of the caterers?
RORY,"Oh, hush, hush. No woman of mine is gonna work. All you have to do is sit pretty, and laugh when I tell a good one. Tell her what a funny guy I am, Dawnie."
DAWN,(quickly) Gotta go. (nervous laugh) Enjoy the wedding.
RORY,(noticing something) Oh. Bad head.
CATERER,What?
RORY,"Well, the lip wasn't split right. (lets her go, walks over to the head) You see, what you gotta do is you gotta grab the lip between your thumb and your finger, and then you have to slice right through the center of the meat."
RORY,It was my trade. (leading her away) I used to stuff things. I still do. But only for fun.
HOFFRYN,Ah. Hymen's greetings.
DAWN,Hy - what?
HOFFRYN,"Hymen, the God of Matrimony. His salutations upon you. May the love we celebrate today avoid an almost inevitable decline."
DAWN,(shrugging) Cool.
HOFFRYN,I brought a gift. I suppose there's a table.
DAWN,"Oh, uh... (noticing Halfrek) Halfrek. Hello."
HALFREK,"Oh, please! Call me Hallie, we're practically family now."
DAWN,(displeased) Hmm. Neat. (to D'Hoffryn) I can put this on the table for you.
HOFFRYN,"(giving her the box) Thank you. Uh, careful, it's, uh-"
DAWN,Fragile?
HOFFRYN,Squirmy.
DAWN,Oh.
HALFREK,"So, Dawnie, how's everything? Going good? Nothing you, uh, nothing you *wish* was different...?"
HOFFRYN,"Hallie, for Yekk's sake, take a day off. We're not here to do vengeance, we're here to mingle."
HALFREK,"(OS) Oh, look. It's (unintelligible)"
DAWN,Spike!
SPIKE,"(turns) Oh. Uh, I want you to meet my date."
DAWN,(politely) Hi. I'm Dawn. (shaking hands)
GIRL,Uh-huh.
SPIKE,"(still trying to be cool) So, yeah. Anyway, that's my date. She's with me. My date for the wedding."
DAWN,"(not getting it) Yeah. Okay, well, nice meeting you."
CAROL,"So, circus folk. What's that like?"
RORY,"Uh, your friend, uh, the, the fellow with the warts, went off on his circus 'heritage,' like you folks are all in some kind of cult or something."
CLEM,"Well, there are ancient ways. (the others staring at him) Clowning, as an occupation, grew out of the commedia del'arte, and, uh, ancient sports, of course. (Cousin Carol nodding, smiling)"
RORY,"Yeah, well, the thing is, if you expect Xander to bring up his kids in some kinda foreign-speaky bow-to-the-easty kinda cult-"
DEMON,So you think the children should be raised in ignorance of our ways? (Xander's Mom looking nervous)
CAROL,"No! No, the Harrises are very broad-minded. We're Episcopalians."
HARRIS,'Til death do us part. (cut to closer shot as he laughs sourly) That's what cracks me up.
HARRIS,"Hit me again, barkeep."
XANDER,How do I look?
BUFFY,"Well, let's see. (looking him slowly up from feet to head) Found your shoes ... your fly's zipped. I'd say you look like you're ready to get married."
BUFFY,"You're one of the decent ones, Xander. I hope I'm as lucky as you guys someday."
XANDER,"You wanna get lucky? I've still got, what, fifteen, twenty minutes?"
BUFFY,Oh! All right. (pulls back) Into the breach with you.
XANDER,"Okay, breach me."
XANDER,"Now, let's go over the list one more time. Number one?"
BUFFY,Don't let your dad near the bar.
XANDER,Check. Number two?
BUFFY,Don't let your mom near the bar.
XANDER,Check.
DAWN,(OS) Hey Buffy.
DAWN,Spike's here and he brought a total skank.
BUFFY,(confused) A-
DAWN,Skank! A manic-panicked freak who he's like totally macking with right in the middle of the room. (they stop walking) I saw him shove his tongue-
BUFFY,Spike brought a date?
DAWN,Yeah. (snickering) Wait till you see her.
XANDER,"Guys, I better go meet and greet."
BUFFY,"Uh, just go ahead. I'll be a sec."
HARRIS,Alexander. Do you realize that the usher sat us in the third row?
XANDER,"Mom, I'm sure it was a mistake."
HARRIS,"Well, I-I don't think it was really-"
MAN,Excuse me.
RORY,"Say Neph, do you know where the photographer is? I've got a proposition for him-"
MAN,"(tugging Xander's arm) Please, I really need to talk to you."
DAWN,(OS) Xander?
HARRIS,"Honey, listen to me."
DAWN,"Xander, one of Anya's presents got loose!"
XANDER,Got loose?
HARRIS,It's fine- (unintelligible)
DAWN,"Yeah, it's a fully live squiggily thingy (Xander's mom still talking) and hey, and why is Halfrek a bridesmaid?"
MAN,"Please, please, you have to listen. (pulls Xander away) You have to listen to me!"
MAN,You can't get married today. It's a huge mistake.
XANDER,"Yeah right, thanks for the advice, Uncle ... help me here?"
MAN,"Uncle? You don't recognize me, do you?"
XANDER,"I'm sorry, I don't-"
MAN,"It sounds crazy, I know. But you have to believe me. (Xander looking puzzled) I'm Xander Harris. I'm you."
XANDER,"What do you mean, you're me?"
MAN,I'm you. I'm you from the future.
XANDER,"Oh, from the future! For a minute I thought you were a nutball but now that you're from the future-"
MAN,"(agitated) Please, listen to me. I found a way back to warn you. To tell you-"
XANDER,"Hey, hey, easy, easy. Everything's going to be all right."
HARRIS,(OS) Toast!
XANDER,(looks over his shoulder) I swear I told that guy no drinks before the ceremony.
HARRIS,(OS) Toast!
HARRIS,A toast! To the Harris clan.
MAN,Look. Look! I can prove it to you.
HARRIS,(faintly in background) I know in the past we've had our problems...
MAN,I thought you might need convincing. Come on. Follow me.
HARRIS,"...and to my wife, Jessica. Where are you, honey?"
HARRIS,"There she is. (raising glass) To my wife. What would I do without you, beautiful?"
HARRIS,"Wellllllll, for starters, I probably wouldn't need to drink so much, would I."
HARRIS,"On the brighter side, marriage has probably saved me from a nasty dose of the clap. (chuckles) Here's to ya. (drinks)"
CLEM,Does this jerk ever shut up?
DEMON,He's starting to make my suckers twitch.
HARRIS,And a toast ... to the bride's dermatologically-challenged family shrub.
DEMON,Sit down!
HARRIS,"Hey, I paid for all this! You want me to sit down, you cough up a couple of grand, Squidly."
DEMON,"What'd you call me, you drunken piece of sh-"
BUFFY,Mazel tov!
HARRIS,"Hey, what's this?"
BUFFY,"(super-cheerful) You must be so happy for Xander on his very special, once-in-a-lifetime day, huh, Mr. Harris?"
HARRIS,"(ogling her) Nice chassis, what's under the hood? Rrowr!"
BUFFY,"You know, I could use a strong cup of coffee. Hey, let's get you one too, what do you say?"
HARRIS,Did you used to own a little square pinkish purse?
BUFFY,"(less cheerful, sighs) I did."
HARRIS,"I thought so. Hey, what do you say we slip in the back room and I show you my-"
BUFFY,You finish that sentence and I guarantee you won't have anything to show.
XANDER,What is it?
MAN,It's magic. (The orb begins to glow again) Very powerful. Look at it. You'll see what I've seen. Feel what I've felt.
to,"a messy living room. An ironing board piled with clothes, stuff on the floor, etc. In background we see a foyer and a door to the outside. It's sunny. In foreground there's a big leather-covered armchair."
XANDER,(calls) Anya.
XANDER,Anya!
SARAH,"(shrieks) Get the hell away from me! Dad, Josh is teasing me."
JOSH,Sarah's a weirdo! Sarah's a weirdo!
ANYA,(to Xander) What.
XANDER,You going out again?
ANYA,(picking up a small wastebasket) I'm doing a make-over party.
XANDER,I thought you hated those.
ANYA,"Well, one of us has to make some money. (picking up empty beer bottles)"
XANDER,"(angry) Well, what do you want me to do, Anya? Huh? I can't work. My back is shot."
ANYA,And whose fault is that?
XANDER,"Oh, no no no. Not the Buffy thing again."
ANYA,You had no business fighting demons with her.
XANDER,Buffy needed me. I had to help.
ANYA,"(bitterly) Well, it didn't save her, did it? (Xander drinking beer) All it did was ruin our lives."
ANYA,(OS) I'll be late.
XANDER,(yells) I hope you crash in your stupid pink car!
XANDER,What?
SARAH,(OS) I hate this place.
SARAH,You guys know I don't eat wheat.
JOSH,"You don't eat anything, freak."
SARAH,At least I'm not a mama's boy.
JOSH,At least I'm not a demonic freak.
SARAH,"Dad, make him cut it!"
XANDER,Maybe you should talk to your mother about that.
ANYA,You've had too much wine.
XANDER,Have I? (angry) I'm just saying maybe you should talk to your daughter!
SARAH,"Ohh, I hate you guys! (standing up) And I know that you're not my real dad, and I hate you, I hate you both! I wish you'd die!"
JOSH,This sucks.
XANDER,"(O.S.) If you were so unhappy, why didn't you just leave?"
ANYA,(O.S.) I wanted to. I should have!
XANDER,"Yeah, you should have. 'Cause then maybe I would have gotten some touch in the past twenty years."
ANYA,I wasn't the one who stopped touching!
XANDER,"Oh! Maybe, but you weren't touching me!"
ANYA,What did you expect me to do? You wouldn't come near me after Buffy-
XANDER,(shouts) Don't bring her into this!
ANYA,"Fine. Forget her. Maybe you were just born to be a bitter, angry old man."
XANDER,"(quietly, very angry) Shut up."
ANYA,No! (tearfully) I want my life back! If I hadn't married you I wouldn't have had to hate myself for the last THIRTY YEARS!
XANDER,SHUT UP!
MAN,I'm so sorry. I didn't want to show you.
XANDER,What happened? What was that?
MAN,A glimpse of your future. Harnessed ... by magic.
XANDER,"Is she okay? (panicky) Is she okay, what did I do?!"
MAN,"Listen. I don't have long here. The spell that brought me back, it won't last. (Xander still looking shell-shocked) But you can change things. It doesn't have to go like this. But you can't marry Anya."
XANDER,But-
MAN,"You'll hurt her less today than you will later. Believe me. Sometimes, two people ... all they bring each other ... is pain."
SPIKE,"(quietly) Hello, Buffy."
BUFFY,Hey.
SPIKE,It's a happy occasion. You meet my friend?
BUFFY,No. Not yet. But she seems like a very nice attempt at making me jealous.
SPIKE,(small smile) Is it working?
BUFFY,"(quietly) A little. It doesn't change anything ... but if you're wildly curious, yeah, it hurts."
SPIKE,"(softly) I'm sorry. (remembers himself) Or, Good!"
SPIKE,You want us to go?
BUFFY,"No. No, I ... you have every right to be here. I pretty much deserve-"
SPIKE,"That's not true, you... (sighs, looks at the ceiling) God, this is hard."
BUFFY,Yeah.
SPIKE,(sighs) I think we'll go.
BUFFY,Go where? To your place?
SPIKE,"(not thrilled) Yeah, I suppose. That was the idea."
BUFFY,Yeah.
SPIKE,(defensively) Evil.
BUFFY,Of course.
SPIKE,But I won't. Or I... (frustrated) I'll just go. Give 'em my best or whatever. The happy couple.
BUFFY,I will.
SPIKE,"(quietly) It's nice to watch you be happy. For them, even. I don't see it a lot. You, uh... you glow."
BUFFY,(smiles) That's because the dress is radioactive.
BUFFY,I should...
SPIKE,Yeah.
SPIKE,But it hurts?
BUFFY,Yeah.
SPIKE,(quietly) Thanks.
BUFFY,(to herself) You're welcome.
SPIKE,Let's go then.
GIRL,What about the wedding?
SPIKE,"Let's just piss off, all right?"
WILLOW,I'll say this for the Y chromosome ... looks good in a tux.
XANDER,"(tries to smile) Well, your double X's don't look too bad there, either."
WILLOW,(fiddles with his clothing) You're getting married. My little Xander.
XANDER,All growed up.
WILLOW,"It's a good thing I realized I was gay, otherwise, hey, you, me and formal wear..."
WILLOW,Do you know how much I love you?
XANDER,Mmm ... 'bout half as much as I love you.
WILLOW,(smiling) You ready for the long walk?
XANDER,"Um ... yeah, just give me a sec, I wanna work on my vows."
WILLOW,Take your time. It's not like we can start the wedding without you.
ANYA,"'I, Anya, promise to cherish you...' Ew, no, not cherish. Uh, 'I promise...'"
ANYA,"'...to have sex with you whenever ... *I* want, and, uh... (walking down off the platform) uh, pledge to be your friend, and your wife, and your confidant, and your sex poodle...'"
TARA,"Uh, sex poodle?"
ANYA,"Yeah, why?"
TARA,"Um, I'm not sure you should say 'sex poodle' in your vows."
ANYA,Huh.
ANYA,Music. They're playing the music! This is it.
BUFFY,Are you ready to go?
WILLOW,He's gone. Xander disappeared!
BUFFY,What? Xander's gone? (anxious) Wha-what should we do?
WILLOW,I'm gonna go look for him ... I'm gonna find him. A-and you're going to stall.
BUFFY,"Uh, heh, sorry about that. Um... (closes the door) there's just gonna be a little bit of a delay."
ANYA,Why? What's wrong?
BUFFY,"Nothing! (Tara comes up beside Buffy) Nothing's wrong, it's just, um, it, the, the, minister. He had, uh ... to go ... and perform an emergency C-section."
ANYA,A C-section? (Tara looking very dubious)
BUFFY,"Yeah! You know, he's, uh, not, not just a minister, he's also a, a doctor. You know, he's half-minister, half-doctor, he's a-a mini-tor. Not, of course, to be confused with a minotaur! Because he's all, you know, man, this doctor minister man, no, no bull parts whatsoever."
ANYA,(turns away to primp in the mirror) Uh-huh.
BUFFY,"So it, it should just be a couple of minutes."
ANYA,Okay.
ANYA,"(still looking in mirror, clears throat) Okay. (turns to face Tara) For the last time. 'I, Anya, want to marry you, Xander, because ... I love you and I'll always love you. And ... before I knew you, I was like a completely different person. Not even a person, really...'"
VOICEOVER,"'...and I had seen what love could do to people, and it was ... hurt and sadness. Alone was better. And then, suddenly there was you, and ... you knew me. You saw me, and it was this ... thing. You make me feel safe and warm.'"
ANYA,"'So, I get it now. I finally get love, Xander. I really do.'"
KAREN,I'm bored.
CAROL,"It's a wedding, honey. We're all bored."
BUFFY,"No! No, it isn't ... (to guests, nervously) It's not what you think."
CAROL,(tearfully) Beautiful.
ANYA,"I mean, I am sorry, but what the hell is that minister thinking?"
TARA,"Uh, I don't know, he-"
ANYA,"I mean, delivering a baby! On my special day! I mean, it's totally rude of him and the mother. I mean, why couldn't he have just told her to hold it?"
HARRIS,Gimme a double Jack.
HARRIS,This is a disaster.
HARRIS,"It's that Anya, I know it. She made us pay for the whole thing and now she's going to louse it up. Women!"
HARRIS,(annoyed) I offered to help. She didn't want my help.
HALFREK,"This thing totally isn't happening. We should have known that she would never, ever-"
HOFFRYN,I'm worried about Anya.
HALFREK,"(bitterly) Oh, sure. Of course you are."
HOFFRYN,"Oh, Halfrek. (leans forward and puts hands on her shoulder) You know I love all my demons equally."
CAROL,"Buffy, you've gotta do something."
to,close shot of the microphone on the stage. A hand reaches out and removes the mike from its stand. Reveal Buffy looking out at the crowd.
BUFFY,(fake cheer) So ... who here's from out of town?
TEEN,My family is worse.
DAWN,(scoffs) No way. Mine is so messed up you have no idea.
TEEN,"No, just wait until you see my mom dance at the reception, okay, and then tell me who's messed up."
DAWN,(laughs) I guess they're all messed up.
TEEN,Yeah. Everybody's pretty lame.
GUESTS,First word...
GUESTS,(guessing) Antlers? Animals? Bull!
TARA,"Anya, wait up!"
ANYA,"This bride waits for no one. If the minister's not here yet, well then we'll just have to get married without a minister."
TEEN,Geez. What is the holdup?
DAWN,Can you keep a secret?
DAWN,"Nobody knows this, but the groom? He took off and no one can find him."
ANYA,(turning to Dawn) What?
DAWN,(uh-oh) Um...
TEEN,"I'll catch you later, Dawn."
ANYA,Xander's gone? Xander is missing? (loudly) What do you mean Xander's missing?!
RORY,"(chuckles) It's a joke. Xander's playing a joke. It's like one time, at one of Carol's weddings, I had this ape suit-"
DEMON,"Oh, great."
RORY,-and I put it on-
DEMON,Another Harris family joke.
DEMON,(to Mr. Harris) Why don't *you* have another drink?
HARRIS,(slurred) Drinking ... is the only way I can dull the pain ... (stands up) of looking at your ugly face.
DEMON,"You better think real hard about this, Harris."
HARRIS,Don't touch me with those nasty circus things!
DEMON,That's it!
TARA,Thanks.
WILLOW,You okay?
TARA,Yeah.
ANYA,Xander? (to fighters) Have you seen Xander? Has anyone seen Xander?
CAROL,"Well, I saw him go in the Trophy Room with that guy!"
ANYA,You. You were talking to Xander right before he left. What did he say to you? What did you say to him?
MAN,"Really doesn't matter now, does it? It's done."
ANYA,What's done? Did you... If you said something to make him leave...
MAN,You'll what? Haven't changed a bit. Still as vindictive as ever.
ANYA,(frowns) Do I know you?
MAN,"You don't recognize me, Anya? I'm not the man I used to be. I know."
BUFFY,(into microphone) Guys! Will you break it up?
ANYA,"Xander. Where is he? You tell me, old man! You tell me why he left!"
MAN,He left because of you.
ANYA,(upset) I didn't do anything.
MAN,"Oh, really? What about this?"
ANYA,Tell me what you did with Xander. What are you?
DEMON,"(deep demony voice) You did this. You brought this on. I've waited a long time for this, Anyanka."
ANYA,(tearful) Who are you?
DEMON,"Remember Chicago? South Side, 1914?"
DEMON,"Stewart Burns. Philanderer! You'd think you'd remember. I remember you. But then again, you ruined my life."
ANYA,You were a ... I punished you.
DEMON,"That's right. Some hussy I'd been taking around summons you, next thing I know, I look like this and I'm being tortured in another dimension."
ANYA,I forgot.
DEMON,"Well, I didn't."
BUFFY,Anya!
DEMON,"Every day I remembered ... and every day I thought how I would somehow get here, and ruin your life like you ruined mine. It didn't take much either. I scared off your fiance with a couple of phony visions."
ANYA,(tearful) Visions of what?
DEMON,Your future. Or his nightmare vision of your future.
ANYA,(crying) That's it? That's all you did?
DEMON,"Yeah, it was easy. Look at that, you're crying. Oh, I like that."
ANYA,(whispers) Stop it.
DEMON,"Oh, cry, Anyanka, cry. I love to see you cry. And now, I'd love to see you scream."
DEMON,Come any closer and I'll kill her.
XANDER,Anya!
ANYA,Xander!
ANYA,"I'm so ... I'm so glad you're here. It was all lies, what he showed you ... it wasn't true, he just wanted to break us up."
XANDER,It doesn't matter now.
ANYA,So we'll be okay.
BUFFY,Excuse me.
XANDER,It's dead.
BUFFY,Yup.
WILLOW,Is anyone else waiting for it to go poof? (they all continue staring at the corpse) Maybe we can cover it with flowers.
HARRIS,"Look at this damage. I'm not paying for this, you freaks!"
KRELVIN,Stop calling us freaks!
HARRIS,"Oh no! No, not again! No!"
ANYA,Stop It!
ANYA,(commanding) Everyone sit down!
ANYA,"This wedding will go on, so get back in your seats!"
ANYA,"You know, it's bad luck to see me in my dress."
ANYA,"Hey. It's okay. It's all over now, he's dead, and it was just smoke and mirrors."
XANDER,I know.
ANYA,(smiling) So ... we're ready now. Let's get married.
XANDER,I...
XANDER,"I'm not. (Anya looking confused) I'm not ready. I can't, Ahn, I'm sorry."
ANYA,"But it wa - it wasn't real. What he showed you, it wasn't real."
XANDER,I know it wasn't real. But it could be.
ANYA,"What was it? Was it about me? 'Cause he wanted you to hate me, Xander."
XANDER,"It wasn't you. (sighs) It wasn't you I was hating. (pauses) I had these thoughts, and ... fears before this."
XANDER,Maybe we just went too fast.
ANYA,"Look, everybody has thoughts. It's natural, it doesn't mean that, that getting married is wrong."
XANDER,"I know, I know..."
ANYA,"(desperate) Look, you're just shaken up, okay? You just calm down and we'll start over, okay?"
XANDER,"(tearful) We can't start over. If this is a mistake, it's forever, and ... I don't want to hurt you. Not that way."
XANDER,I'm sorry. (Anya crying) I am so sorry.
to,close shot of a coffee-table with a mug on it. A hand reaches out and picks it up.
DAWN,(OS) Should we do something for her?
DAWN,Anything?
WILLOW,(OS) She wants to be alone. That's what she wants.
WILLOW,"(softly) Oh, god, it just hurts my heart to think of her."
BUFFY,(softly) I know. The whole thing hurts my heart.
DAWN,(softly) I thought they were happy.
BUFFY,They were. I know they were. They were supposed to be my light at the end of the tunnel. I guess they were a train.
DAWN,Why did this happen?
WILLOW,I don't know. I feel like I should be hating Xander. But I can't. (sighs) I just ... I just hope he's okay.
DAWN,I wonder where he is.
to,"hallway of a crappy motel. The manager opens a door marked 7, revealing a crappy little room. He walks in, followed by Xander (still wearing his tux). The manager hands Xander the key."
MANAGER,Not much to explain. Air conditioner's busted.
MANAGER,That's it. Check-out's at eleven.
to,"close shot on Anya's face, still tear-streaked, still wearing her wedding gown but not the veil. Around her it's all black, as in a featureless demon realm."
HOFFRYN,Are you okay?
ANYA,"(shakes her head) I'm tired... (sniffles) of crying. (teary) I'm just so tired, D'Hoffryn."
HOFFRYN,"(sighs) Oh, Anyanka. I'm sorry. (pause) But you let him domesticate you. When you were a vengeance demon, you were powerful, at the top of your game. You crushed men like him."
HOFFRYN,It's time you got back to what you do best ... don't you think?
