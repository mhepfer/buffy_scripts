character,dialogue
Buffy,"Come on, Mom, please?"
Joyce,"I'm sorry, honey."
Buffy,Don't you understand how important this is?
Joyce,It's an outfit. An outfit that you may never buy.
Buffy,But I looked good in it.
Joyce,You looked like a streetwalker.
Buffy,"But a thin streetwalker. (gets a look from her mom) That's  probably not gonna be the winning argument, is it?"
Joyce,You're just too young to wear that.
Buffy,"Yeah, and I'm gonna be too young to wear it until I'm too old to  wear it."
Joyce,"That's the idea. (stops and looks around) The stores are  closing, and I still need to order the flyers for the opening.  (considers, then puts both bags in one hand) Okay. I'll go to the  printers and then get our food, (pulls out a slip of paper) you go to  the tailor and pick up my outfit from Everyday Woman. (hands Buffy the  slip of paper)"
Buffy,(looks at the paper) Everyday Woman?
Joyce,Mm-hm. There's the receipt.
Buffy,Why didn't you just go to Muu-Muus R Us?
Joyce,"Do now, make fun of your mother later. (walks off)"
Lyle,"Turn around, baby, I have somethin' to show ya."
Girl,Wait a sec. This is my high score.
Lyle,"Well, ain't you just got the prettiest little neck I ever did  see."
Buffy,"Boy, you guys really never come up with any new lines, do you?"
Girl,Do you mind? We were talking here.
Buffy,"(stares down the vampire) But you promised you'd never cheat on  me again, honey."
Girl,"(pulls her bag onto her arm) Um, I better go."
Lyle,But I ain't done yet.
Lyle,"Alright, sugar lips. (puts on his hat and faces off with her)  Giddy-up!"
Lyle,"Well, you're a rough one, ain't cha! I like that!"
Lyle,You must be that Slayer I've been hearin' so much about. Lyle  Gorch. Pleased to meet cha!
Buffy,Pleasure's mine!
Lyle,This ain't over!
Buffy,"Oh, sure. They *say* they'll call."
Buffy,"Oh, bliss. (sits) Mall food. (looks up)"
Joyce,Buffy?
Buffy,(attentive) Mom?
Joyce,Where's my dress?
Buffy,"(confused) Your dr...? Oh. (winces) Oh, God."
Joyce,Let me guess: you were distracted by a boy.
Buffy,(cringes) Technically.
Joyce,(leans back) Buffy...
Buffy,"(exhales) Look, I-I can go get it right now."
Joyce,They're closed. I'll just have to fit it in tomorrow.
Buffy,Sorry.
Joyce,"(sternly) A little responsibility is all I ask. Honestly, don't  you ever think about anything besides boys and clothes?"
Buffy,Saving the world from vampires?
Joyce,"(crosses her arms and shakes her head) I swear, sometimes I  don't know what goes on in your head."
Cordelia,Xander? (continues kissing)
Xander,Shhh-sh-sh. (continues kissing)
Cordelia,It's just that (kiss) I'm worried we're gonna miss class.  (continues kissing)
Xander,You know what? This would work a lot better for me if you  didn't talk.
Cordelia,"Well, it'd work a lot better for me with the lights off."
Xander,Are you saying that you can't look at me when we do... whatever  it is we do?
Cordelia,"No, it's not that I can't, it's just more... I don't want to."
Xander,"That's great! That's just dandy! We're repulsed by each other,  we, (indicates the door) we hide from our friends..."
Cordelia,"Well, I should hope so! Please!"
Xander,(nods) All in all this is not what I'd call a big self-esteem  booster.
Cordelia,Tell me about it! (looks him over) Just look at you! And  those clothes. Where did you get those shoes?!
Xander,"Okay, you know what? I don't need this."
Cordelia,Ditto! Like a hole in the head!
Xander,Yes! (raises his hand and nods) Mm-hm.
Xander,Oh.
Cordelia,"Well, that depends. Are you talking about sex *in* the car or  *out* of the car? (Mr. Whitmore looks confused) Because I have a friend,  not me, that was in a Miata at, parked at the top of the hill, and then  she kicked the gearshift, and, and..."
Xander,"You wanna talk negative consequence? What about the heartbreak  of halitosis? (Cordelia looks at him and he looks back) I mean, a girl  may seem spiffy, but if she ignores her flossing the bloom is definitely  off the rose."
Cordelia,Like that compares to kissing a guy who thinks the Hoover  technique is a *big* turn-on.
Xander,What about having to feign interest in her vapid little chit- chat just so you can get some touch?
Willow,"How about pregnancy? That would be a major one, right?"
Cordelia,You wanna have a baby?
Xander,"Hey. (chuckles) I know we just met, but isn't that Xander Jr.  you're holding?"
Willow,Buffy! How come you weren't in class?
Buffy,Vampire issues. Did Mr. Whitmore notice I was tardy?
Xander,I think the word you're searching for is 'absent'.
Willow,Tardy people show.
Buffy,Right.
Willow,"And, yes, he did notice, so he wanted me to give you this.  (hands her an egg)"
Buffy,(rolls the egg around in her hands) As far as punishments go  this is fairly abstract.
Willow,"No, it's your baby! (smiles)"
Buffy,"(confused) Okay, I get it even less."
Xander,"Well, you know, it's the whole 'sex leads to responsibility'  thing, which I personally don't get. You gotta take care of the egg.  It's a baby. You gotta keep it safe and teach it Christian values."
Willow,(looks at Xander) My egg is Jewish.
Xander,Then teach it that Dreidel song.
Buffy,"I can't do this! I can't take care of things! I killed my Giga  Pet. Literally, I sat on it and it broke."
Willow,You'll do fine!
Xander,"Yeah, the only thing that stresses me is when do we tell them  that they're adopted?"
Buffy,"I'll just lay that one off on my partner. (looks up, worried)  Who'd I get?"
Willow,"Well, there were an uneven number of students, and you didn't  show, so..."
Buffy,(in shocked disbelief) I'm a single mother?
Xander,(nods) No man of her own.
Buffy,Do you know what this says about me? That I am doomed to lead my  mother's life! (paces back to them) How deeply scary is that?
Xander,"How 'bout this: it says nothing, it means nothing, this whole  egg experiment thing is completely pointless!"
Giles,"(in the cage) Success! (comes out with a book) At last. Your  playmate is a fellow of repute, it seems."
Giles,"That's, um, Lyle Gorch, and that one's his brother, Tector.  They're from Abilene. They, uh, they made their reputation by massacring  an entire Mexican village in 1886. (takes off his glasses to clean them)"
Buffy,Friendly little demons.
Giles,That was before they became vampires.
Giles,"B-but, um, the good news is that they're... not amongst the  great thinkers of our times. I doubt if they're up to much. They're  probably just drawn here by the, uh, Hellmouth's energy. (puts his  glasses back on)"
Xander,'Nuff said! I propose Buffy slays 'em. All in favor? (raises  his hand)
Willow,(raises her hand) Aye!
Giles,"I-I don't think you should underestimate them. I mean, y-you may  need to have some help if, if, if, if... (notices the eggs) Why do you  all have eggs?"
Willow,"(smiles) Hey, maybe you can have Angel help you find the  Gorches."
Giles,"(still confused) Yes! Yes, yes, that's not a bad idea. Strength  in numbers."
Xander,"Oh, right. I see a lotta hunting getting done in *that*  scenario."
Buffy,Please. Like Angel and I are just helpless slaves to passion.  Grow up!
Buffy,I really...
Angel,I know.
Buffy,"You know, this isn't hunting in the classical sense. We  should..."
Angel,You're right.
Angel,Okay.
Buffy,Okay. (kiss) Okay.
Buffy,You see anything?
Angel,No.
Buffy,Okay. (faces him) Enough hunting.
Tector,That the Slayer?
Lyle,Yep.
Tector,Ain't that Angelus with her?
Lyle,Yep.
Tector,"Well, how come she ain't slayin'? And how come he's about to  make me blush?"
Lyle,"Well, I don't know, Tector. And how come you's always askin' me  so many stupid questions?"
Tector,"So, you wanna take him, or, uh, you want me to, Lyle?"
Lyle,I say we leave it. Wait till she's alone.
Tector,Why? You scared?
Lyle,Nope. I could whip 'em both right now if I wanted to.
Tector,Then why don't ya?
Lyle,"(looks at Tector) 'Cause I got me a plan. I'm the one that does  the thinkin', 'member?"
Tector,"Yeah. You do the thinkin', Lyle. That is definitely your  department. So why don't you tell me again why we can't kill 'em now?"
Buffy,"Okay, little egg dude. (sits and opens her egg diary) Let's see.  (reads) Feeding? Check. (marks) Burping? Eeeew... Check (marks) Diapers  (looks at the egg's basket) Sort of, in theory, I guess. (marks)"
Buffy,Okay.
Buffy,"Good night, Eggbert."
Tector,"I'm tired of rat. How come we can't stay in a nice place? (puts  the dead rat down) A motel or somethin'? Maybe, uh... Maybe one with an  ice machine."
Lyle,'Cause we got to keep a low profile till we get this Slayer  business taken care of.
Tector,"Well, how come Angelus is gettin' all cuddly with her, Lyle? I  mean, does the man have no code?"
Lyle,(stirs) Tector... (leans up on his elbow) You gonna be pesterin'  me with these questions all damn day?
Tector,I just don't like it here. Ain't a decent whore in the whole  city limits.
Lyle,"So, this is the thanks I get? (stands up) Well. Don't I take care  of ya? Didn't I near raise ya myself? Hmm? Burden that you were, maybe I  shoulda left you on that doorstep when Momma blew town."
Tector,"Don't say that, Lyle."
Lyle,Now I'm takin' care of this.
Tector,You afraid of the girl?
Lyle,"I'm just playin' it safe. We're just gonna follow her around a  little while, find our time. 'Cause this ain't over."
Tector,(smiles to himself) I think you *are* afraid of the Slayer.
Lyle,(nods) Alright. I'm gonna beat you like a redheaded stepchild.  (points) Throw your ass out in that sunlight. C'mon.
Tector,You think you can?
Lyle,"(goads him on) Giddy-up, son."
Tector,"(laughs) Oh, man!"
Lyle,"Yippe-ki-yay, matey!"
Buffy,"Oh... Oh, God..."
Joyce,At least eat something if you're gonna drink that.
Buffy,Not that hungry.
Joyce,How's the parenting going?
Buffy,Fine.
Joyce,Are you sure your egg is secure in that?
Buffy,(looks up at her) Did I ask for backseat mommying?
Joyce,(gives her a look) Are we a little touchy this morning?
Buffy,"No, I just feel all funky."
Joyce,Hmm. (feels her forehead) You don't have a fever.
Buffy,"Oh, no, it's not that, I just... I didn't sleep well."
Joyce,(bends down to her daughter) What's the matter? Your egg keep  you up all night?
Buffy,(gives her mom a look) You're killing me. Parenting's a pain!
Joyce,(straightens up and smiles smugly) Wait till it starts dating.
Giles,Oh! Why are you three hanging about? Don't you have classes to  go to?
Willow,Teen health got canceled.
Xander,Mr. Whitmore's out. Couldn't find an egg sitter or something.
Giles,"Well, then, can you give me a hand?"
Xander,Sure! (starts to shelve some books)
Giles,"How did the, um... hunt go last night, Buffy?"
Buffy,No go.
Giles,"Uh, 'no', 'no' you didn't go, or, or, or you were unsuccessful?"
Buffy,No Gorches.
Xander,Apparently Buffy has decided the problem with the English  language is all those pesky words. (looks at her) You... Angel... big...  smoochies?
Buffy,Shut... up.
Giles,"I-it's true, Buffy, you and Willow do seem a little sluggish.  Are you quite sure everything's alright?"
Willow,Maybe something we ate.
Xander,"Or perhaps it's the burden of parenthood. Notice how seriously  you two have taken this egg thing. (the girls clutch their egg baskets)  While I, in turn, have, uh, well, chosen a (takes his egg out of his  shirt pocket) more balanced approach. (starts tossing it around)"
Willow,"(concerned) Xander, maybe you shouldn't..."
Xander,(interrupts) That's exactly what I'm talking about. (tosses)  You can't stress over every little thing! (tosses) A child picks up on  that. Which is a one-way ticket (tosses) to neurotic city.
Willow,(surprised) It didn't break! (suspicious) How come it didn't  break?
Xander,(realizes he's been found out) Which is another secret to  conscientious egg care: pot of scalding water and about eight minutes.
Willow,You boiled your young?
Xander,"Yeah! I know it sounds cruel, but sometimes you gotta be cruel  to be kind! I mean, you can bet that little Xander here is thick skinned  now."
Giles,"Technically that would be cheating, yes?"
Xander,"No! It's like a short cut. You know, when you run a race?"
Buffy,That would also be cheating.
Willow,(shakes her head) You should be ashamed.
Giles,I suppose there is a sort of... Machiavellian ingenuity to your  transgression.
Xander,I resent that! (gets a look from Giles) Or possibly thank you.
Cordelia,Figures you three would all be hanging in the dungeon while  something major's going on at Sunnydale High.
Xander,"And what would that be, Cordelia? Barrette Appreciation Day?  (goes back to his shelving)"
Cordelia,Mr. Whitmore didn't show today.
Buffy,That news is of the past.
Cordelia,He's missing? (the girls all look at Giles) Presumed dead?
Giles,Presumed by whom?
Cordelia,"Well, me! (crosses her arms)"
Giles,I think we should give him a few hours before we give up on him  completely.
Cordelia,"Well, I think we should look around, don't you Xander?"
Xander,(looks at her and shakes his head) It can wait.
Cordelia,"Well, his body could fall out of a closet somewhere."
Cordelia,So we should check some closets to see if he's in a closet?
Xander,(points at her) You're right. There could be a closet. Let's  go.
Xander,You guys look for more clues. We'll meet back here.
Buffy,(unenthusiastically) We'll get right on it.
Willow,(staring after them) Are they getting weirder? Have you noticed  the weirdness of them? (looks at Buffy)
Buffy,They're weird. (to Giles) Should I have guilt about not looking  for Mr. Whitmore?
Giles,I-I'd rather you conserve your strength for hunting the Gorches.
Buffy,I'll be fine by tonight. Maybe I'll sweep the cemetery?
Giles,"(concerned) Well, be careful, i-i-if you're still feeling a  little sluggish."
Buffy,No worries.
Willow,"And Angel's helping you, right?"
Buffy,He does what he can.
Buffy,"Ahh... (kisses) (breaks off) As much as I hate to say this, we  should really go kill bad guys. (kiss)"
Angel,It's late. You should really get home. Hmm? (kiss)
Buffy,What about the Gorches? (kiss)
Angel,I'll hunt. (kiss)
Buffy,Really? (pulls back and smiles) You'd do that?
Angel,Not like I have an early day tomorrow.
Buffy,"Mm, (kiss) true. (they walk) I still have to go home and fill  out my egg diary."
Angel,Your what?
Buffy,"Oh, I told you, that faux parenting gig we're doing at school.  (faces him) Like I'm really planning to have kids anytime soon. Uh,  maybe *some*day, in the future, when I'm done having a life, but...  right now kids would be just a little too much to deal with."
Angel,"I wouldn't know. (looks at her) I don't... Well, you know, I, I  can't."
Buffy,"Oh. (looks away briefly, then back) That's okay, um... I-I  figured there were all sorts of things vampires couldn't do. You know,  like work for the Telephone Company, or volunteer for the Red Cross,  or... have little vampires."
Angel,So you don't think about the future?
Buffy,No.
Angel,Never?
Buffy,No.
Angel,(swallows) You really don't care what happens a year from now?  Five years from now?
Buffy,"Angel, when I look into the future, a-a... all I see is you! All  I want is you."
Angel,I know the feeling.
Watchman,Hello? Is anybody in here?
Buffy,Come on! Pick up!
Willow,(after the first ring) Hello?
Buffy,Willow! Are you okay?
Willow,(cut to her) Why shouldn't I be?
Buffy,(cut to her) Your egg! I-is it doing anything?
Willow,(cut to her) (confused) Doing what?
Buffy,Break it! (cut to her) Right now! I want you to smash it with  something heavy!
Willow,"Buffy, what..."
Buffy,"My egg! It went... It went postal on me! The thing hatched, and  it, it sprung this creepy-crawly thing, and it attacked me!"
Willow,(cut to her) Are you okay?
Buffy,"(cut to her) Yeah, no, I'm fine, but, but your egg!"
Willow,"(cut to her) I-is totally normal. Uh, I put it in the fridge."
Buffy,Oh.
Willow,Maybe it's a trap. Something the Gorch bothers planted for you?
Buffy,"(cut to her) Maybe. Yeah, uh... I'm sorry, I shouldn't have  woken you. Uh, g-go back to sleep."
Willow,(cut to her) You sure?
Buffy,"(cut to her) Yeah! Yeah, I'm, I'm better. I'm, I'm fine."
Willow,(cut to her) Okay. I'll see ya tomorrow.
Joyce,What's going on in here?
Joyce,"Buffy, who are you talking to at this ho...?"
Joyce,Why are you dressed? Where exactly do you think you're going at  this hour of the night?
Buffy,Nowhere.
Joyce,Who was that on the phone? (comes in further)
Buffy,"Um, uh, Willow. (exhales) She wasn't feeling well today, so I  was just calling to make sure she was feeling better."
Joyce,"(crosses her arms) You're gonna have to do much better than  that, young lady."
Buffy,I had a bad dream?
Joyce,"Oh, no, you're about to have a bad dream! (comes to stand next  to her) A dream that you are grounded for the rest of your natural life."
Joyce,"Which means: no after school socializing, no Bronze, no nothing.  Not until I say so. Do you understand?"
Buffy,"Yeah, but I think you're..."
Joyce,"(interrupts) Now, school ends at 2:30. I want you to go to the  library at 2:33 and study until I pick you up there at 5:30. Understood?"
Buffy,Yeah.
Joyce,Good. Have a nice day.
Buffy,Nice bear. Listen is your...
Cordelia,"(interrupts) Hey, I'll have you know that my father brought  this bear back from Gstaad years ago. Then all of a sudden these  trendoids everywhere started sporting them. So I'm totally not wearing  it. Then I thought, hey, I'm the one who started this nationwide craze!  What am I ashamed of?"
Buffy,"Okay, Soliloquy Girl, I just wanted to ask about your egg."
Cordelia,My egg?
Buffy,Yeah. Your egg. The one Mr. Whitmore gave you.
Cordelia,It's in my bear.
Buffy,"So, your egg isn't acting odd or anything?"
Cordelia,"It isn't acting anything. It's an egg, Buffy, it doesn't  emote. (sees another friend) Shanisse! (goes away) Is that your real  hair?"
Willow,Hey!
Buffy,Hi!
Xander,Mm. Cardboardy!
Xander,"Sorry, Junior, but a man's gotta eat."
Willow,"So, was there any more hatchling activity last night?"
Buffy,"No. Uh, you were probably right. It was just a trap from them  set for me. And, (sees Cordelia) mm, (indicates her) everyone else's egg  seemed perfectly normal."
Xander,Did you bring the thing that attacked you.
Buffy,Yeah. Giles wants to see it. He's in full research mode.
Willow,"Okay. Well, bring it to the science lab, and I'll get Giles,  and we'll analyze it."
Buffy,"Great. You know, I always say that a day without an autopsy...  is like a day without sunshine."
Xander,Hey.
Xander,Can I just say Gyughhh!
Buffy,I see your 'Gyughhh!' and raise you a Nyaghhh!
Cordelia,What is it?
Xander,"We don't know what it is, Cordelia, that's why we're here.  Capisce?"
Cordelia,"'Capisce'? What are you, world traveler now?"
Buffy,"Hey, where's Giles? I know he won't wanna miss this."
Willow,He said to get started. He'll be by as soon as possible.
Xander,"So, okay! Get started, Buffy! Dissect it or something. (hands  her a scalpel)"
Buffy,(takes the blade) Me? Why do *I* have to dissect it?
Xander,"Uh, because you're the Slayer?"
Buffy,And I slayed! My work here is done. (puts the scalpel on the  table in front of Xander)
Xander,"Oh, no, I almost *ate* one of those things. I think I've  fulfilled my gross-out quota for the decade."
Willow,Guys...
Xander,"Do we even know what to look for? I mean, how are we supposed  to figure out what this thing is?"
Buffy,Turn it over. Maybe we missed its ID bracelet.
Xander,"So, now I guess, uh, we know what happened to Mr. Whitmore."
Cordelia,He saw this and ran away?
Buffy,Try best case scenario.
Willow,It's possible that Mr. Whitmore wasn't harmed. Maybe the  offspring simply used him to return to the mother bezoar.
Xander,Yeah. Maybe he... (turns to Willow) What?
Buffy,What's a bez...
Xander,Cordy! What...
Joyce,Buffy?
Joyce,Hello?
Giles,(pokes his head out of the cage) Hello?
Joyce,"(faces him) Oh! Mr. Giles, hi. Uh, I-I was looking for Buffy.  She, she was supposed to wait for me here."
Giles,"Well, sh-she hasn't been in. I-I've been waiting to talk to her  myself about, uh, uh... h-history texts."
Joyce,(leans on the card catalog) That is just the last straw!
Giles,"I-I'm sure she didn't mean to, uh..."
Joyce,"She never means to, but somehow she always manages to anyway. Do  you have children, Mr. Giles?"
Giles,Um...
Joyce,(whispers) Sh-should I be whispering?
Giles,"(whispers) No. (speaks) A-a-and, uh, no, I, I haven't any  children. A-although, uh, sometimes I feel as though I do, uh, working  here..."
Joyce,"They can be such a... (considers her words) Oh, uh, I-I-I don't  want to say 'burden', but, uh... Uh, actually I kind of *do* want to say  'burden'! (smiles)"
Giles,(smiles) Feel free!
Joyce,"Oh, they're just so irresponsible."
Giles,Sometimes.
Joyce,"(notices the books lying on the catalog) 'Bristow's Demon  Index', 'Hell's Offspring'?"
Giles,"(takes the books) A hobby of mine, uh, but, uh, having nothing  to do with Buffy in any way."
Giles,"Um, you say Buffy told you that she'd be here all afternoon?"
Joyce,"Well, yes. I-i-is something wrong?"
Giles,"Oh, I'm sure it's nothing. (pulls open a drawer) (hears a noise  in the hall) What was that?"
Joyce,"Mm, probably the janitor."
Buffy,Hey! Xander! (slaps his cheek) Hey! You alright?
Xander,"(wakes, moans and blinks his eyes) Last time Cordy dragged me  in here it was a lot nicer."
Buffy,What?
Xander,"Uh... (fully awake now) Huh? Nothing. Uh, crazy talk. Head  trauma."
Buffy,(helps him sit up) Tell me about it. I'm gonna have a (feels her  head) big bump.
Xander,"Uh, I'm gonna have a peninsula! (points at his head) Here, (she  helps him up) what, what the hell's goin' on? Cordy and Willow?"
Buffy,"Something to do with the hatchlings, I'm sure of it."
Xander,"What, are they possessed?"
Buffy,I don't know. But they sure wanted us out of the way.
Xander,"(holding his head) Well, why not kill us? (lets go of his head)  Why, uh, why drag us in here?"
Xander,Oh. (steps back) Bad now.
Xander,(holds his head again) Thank you. (moans and follows her out)
Buffy,Giles!
Xander,Giles!
Xander,He must be out somewhere.
Buffy,"Well, he picked a helluva time to get a life."
Xander,What are we gonna do?
Buffy,We can't fight these things until we know something about 'em.
Xander,"(thinks) Alright, Willow said something. Uh, a name. What was  it?"
Buffy,A bozo! Not a bozo.
Xander,A bezoar.
Buffy,"That's it! Okay, so now... we look it up?"
Xander,In what?
Buffy,A book?
Buffy,Giles said he was gonna try to find something...
Buffy,And I'd say he found something.
Xander,I'd say something found him.
Buffy,"'Pre-pre-historic parasite. The mother hibernates underground,  laying eggs. The offspring then attach themselves to a host, taking  control of their motor functions through neural clamping.'"
Xander,'Neural clamping.' That sounds skippable.
Buffy,"So, our people are taking orders from the mama bezoar. Which  begs the question..."
Xander,What does mama want?
Jonathon,Somebody help me!
Jonathon,Get this thing off me! Get this... Somebody help me! Help!
Buffy,Are you okay?
Jonathon,(deadpan) I'm fine. I slipped.
Buffy,I think I hear mommy calling.
Xander,Uh-huh.
Xander,Do we really wanna go in there?
Buffy,We really don't.
Xander,Careful.
Xander,What are they diggin' up?
Buffy,"Oh, boy."
Buffy,We can't let them spread those eggs.
Xander,"I'll handle it. Um, can you, uh, hold down the fort?"
Buffy,I'm gonna need a weapon. I'm gonna need a *big* weapon.
Xander,Yeah.
Lyle,I told you this weren't over.
Tector,She's so cute. And little. Think we can keep her?
Buffy,"Guys, this really isn't a great time."
Lyle,"Oh, it's gonna be. (smiles)"
Lyle,ALRIGHT! THAT'S MY BROTHER!
Lyle,What the hell is this?
Buffy,Mom?
Willow,(deadpan) Kill them.
Lyle,What the hell is goin' on?!
Buffy,Long story.
Xander,Cordelia! I don't wanna hurt ya. Some of the time.
Xander,That's my BUMP!
Tector,"Well, alright!"
Tector,"Well, looky there!"
Tector,"(smiles) Well, hello!"
Lyle,TECTOR!
Lyle,Tector?
Lyle,This is all *your* fault!
Buffy,How?
Lyle,(nods) Alright. (tips his hat) It's over.
Giles,"Yes, yes, uh, i-i-it was a-a, a gas leak, everyone. Uh, well,  just, uh, get some air, and a... good night's rest, you know, uh, you'll  be fine. These gas things... will happen. (to Xander) W-w-what was it  really?"
Xander,Stick with the gas thing. I'll fill you in tomorrow.
Giles,Right. (walks off)
Xander,(faces Willow and Cordelia) How you guys doin'?
Willow,Did I really hit you?
Xander,(nods) You knocked me out.
Cordelia,Did *I* hit you?
Xander,"(nods hard) Yes, everyone hit me."
Cordelia,"Good. Well, I don't mean 'good' because I hit you, but I  didn't wanna be left out."
Buffy,How is she?
Xander,"She's a bit confused, but it's goin' around."
Buffy,Are you okay?
Joyce,"Buffy, I was worried you'd gotten caught in the building. There,  there was a gas leak. (they walk)"
Buffy,"Uh, yeah, I-I just heard. I was in the gym."
Joyce,I went looking for you in the library.
Buffy,"Oh, well, I was on my way there, when I..."
Joyce,(interrupts) I thought I made it pretty clear that you weren't  to leave the library till I came.
Buffy,"The other side of that is there was a gas leak, and..."
Joyce,"(interrupts) Well, I'm not really interested in the other side  right now. Young lady, you have to learn some responsibility, okay? Once  and for all."
Buffy,I'm grounded?
Joyce,You're already grounded.
Buffy,"Oh, yeah."
Joyce,(stops walking) Until further notice you are confined to your  room. You will not leave your room at any time except to go to school or  the bathroom. Am I making myself clear?
Buffy,You're clear. I won't leave my room.
Joyce,"You're damn right, you won't."
Angel,Are you sure you're not gonna get in trouble?
Buffy,"Hey, I earned this. (kiss) Besides, I'm not breaking any rules."
Joyce,(from the hall) Buffy? Are you going to bed?
Buffy,In a minute!
