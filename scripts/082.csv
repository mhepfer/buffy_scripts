RILEY,Buffy's like nobody else in the world. But she doesn't love me.
GILES,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
RILEY,What have you done to me?
ADAM VOICEOVER,Professor Walsh. She implanted the behavior modifier.
RILEY VOICEOVER,The chip in my head.
ADAM VOICEOVER,"Actually, the chip is here..."
ADAM VOICEOVER,... tied directly into your central nervous system through the thoracic nerve.
RILEY VOICEOVER,What's happening to me?
BUFFY VOICEOVER,Engleman said Walsh was feeding you drugs.
RILEY,Something's crawling inside me.
INITIATIVE DOC,I don't want to think about the damage our guys could do under the stress of withdrawal.
JOYCE VOICEOVER,"Buffy? If you're going out, why don't you take your sister?"
BUFFY/DAWN,(unison) Mom!
DAWN VOICEOVER,Nobody knows who I am. Not the real me. No one understands. No one has an older sister who's a Slayer.
BUFFY,Riley?
RILEY,"(smiling) Buffy, what are you doing here?"
BUFFY,My job?
RILEY,"Well, I just thought you were in the north sector."
BUFFY,Watch out!
BUFFY,Never mind.
BUFFY,Why do I even bother to show up?
BUFFY,"Spike, what are you doing here?"
SPIKE,"Same thing as you and your Cub Scout here, I'll wager."
SPIKE,A spot of violence before bedtime.
SPIKE,What? I softened him up.
BUFFY,"Better keep out of my way, Spike. I'm not gonna take this much longer. (Riley walks over to join them.)"
SPIKE,And I should do what in my spare time? Sit at home knitting cunning sweater sets?
BUFFY,Would it keep you out of my way?
RILEY,She's right. You shouldn't be out here when she's patrolling.
SPIKE,"Oh! I saw that. Looks like neither boy's entirely welcome. You should take him home, Slayer. Make him stay there. I've got knitting needles he can borrow."
BUFFY,"Spike ... I just saw you taste your own nose blood, you know what? (Spike grins at her) I'm too grossed out to hear anything you have to say. Go home."
SPIKE,(yelling after them) It's blood! It's what I do!
RILEY,"Hey, hope I didn't get in the way."
BUFFY,"Of course not. I-I was just ... startled. And, you know I don't ... love the idea of you patrolling alone."
RILEY,Not much for bench-warming.
BUFFY,"No, you made the squad. You ... threw that vampire like he was a ... teeny-weeny little vampire."
RILEY,"(grinning) Hey, wanna go again? Come on, I bet this place is just teeming with aerodynamic vampires."
BUFFY,Nah. (pauses) Unless you wanna go back and kill Spike for the fun of it?
SPIKE,"I will know your blood, Slayer. (pause) I will make your neck my chalice ... and drink deep."
SPIKE,(voice coming from the grave) Ow!
WILLOW,You can't possibly be arguing that Marat didn't betray the French Revolutionaries.
WILLOW,"This was the guy who declared the rights of man, and then the next thing you know he's ... killing Girondin like it's going out of style."
BUFFY,"Will, you're totally missing my point. Now, I agree that Marat wasn't a real martyr, but the death in the tub ... the neck wound, all that blood, just a little more fang-y than knife-y. I mean, Charlotte Corday wasn't a real martyr either, but..."
WILLOW,Buffy!
BUFFY,What?
WILLOW,(smiling hugely) Listen to us! We-we're arguing! We're having a debate about a college lecture! I have dreamt of this day since ... forever! (proudly) You are turning into quite the student. (Buffy smiles) Should I be watching my occipital lobe?
BUFFY,Your what?
WILLOW,"Occipital. (pointing to her head) The lobe in the back of your brain. You know, like, ""should I be watching my back?"" But, you know, the ... back of your brain. (sighs)"
BUFFY,"Apparently not. Don't worry, Will, you still wear the smarty-pants in the family."
WILLOW,I don't know. You've been studying ... really a lot.
BUFFY,"I'm trying. But they're really piling on the reading, and Giles fills any free time I have with extra training ... I'm starting to think this working hard is hard work."
WILLOW,Isn't it crazy like that?
BUFFY,"I thought it was gonna be like in the movies. You know, inspirational music ... a montage, me sharpening my pencils, me reading, writing, falling asleep on a big pile of books with my glasses all crooked, 'cause in my montage I have glasses. (Willow nods) But real life is slow, and it's starting to hurt my occipital lobe."
WILLOW,(sympathetic) Aw. Poor Buffy's brain. (Pats Buffy on the head)
BUFFY,"Actually, I'm heading to training now. Do you wanna come with?"
WILLOW,I'm in. (They start walking again) Maybe we can argue some more about the French Revolution. Hey! Wasn't that Robespierre the coolest?
BUFFY,"Robespierre? You're kidding me, right?"
WILLOW,I'm just gettin' it goin'.
GILES,(muffled by the noise) It seems the plans worked perfectly.
XANDER,"Yes, blueprints, not a bad idea. That, and getting straight ""measure twice, cut once."" You know, for the longest time I had it backwards. Mess-y!"
GILES,"(pulling mask down from his mouth, so it hangs around his neck) Well, I must say, I'm very impressed."
XANDER,"Yeah, carpentry is pretty cool."
ANYA,"Oh! Who put the monkey heads near the Styx water? Do we *want* to pick exploded monkey out of our hair? (Picks up a jar and a monkey head, and walks across the room.)"
BUFFY,Trick or treat!
GILES,"Hello, you two, come on in."
WILLOW,"Thank you, kind proprietor."
TARA,"Hey, you."
WILLOW,"Hey! (looking around) Oh, wow, this place looks great. Oh, I feel like a witch in a magic shop. (picks up a jar from a table) Ooh. Are these real newt eyes? (Looks at Giles)"
GILES,"No, too ... rich for my blood, I'm afraid. No, these are salamander eyes, it's the ... cataracts which give them their newt-like appearance. (moving past her) They're really equally effective, though, it's ... just a matter of overcoming snobberies."
XANDER,I'm telling you Giles. You gotta set up a blind taste test and prove once and for all that generic amphibian eyeballs are just as good.
WILLOW,"I don't know. If you ask me, the newt name still means something. (puts down jar and walks off)"
GILES,(to Buffy) You ready to train?
BUFFY,You betcha.
GILES,Shall we then?
BUFFY,We shall then.
TARA,"I just ... keep thinking how cool it would be, if we got a real psychic to sit up here and read fortunes and stuff."
WILLOW,You should do it.
TARA,"Not me. But, but I'd love to, to watch and learn. From someone who's really good, you know?"
WILLOW,"You're really good. (holds out her hands) I'll prove it. Here, do me."
TARA,Hmm.
WILLOW,What do you see?
TARA,Willow hand.
BUFFY,"Unh! Ow, Riley..."
RILEY,Just keeping you on your toes.
BUFFY,"Or off them, as it were. What's gotten into-"
BUFFY,Oh my god. Look at this place!
BUFFY,(gasps) Thank you. (looks up at Giles) Thank you ... so much.
GILES,"(removing his glasses and then the mask that's still around his neck) It's just a start, you need a proper space to train, so-"
BUFFY,I love it. (Giles gives a small smile)
RILEY,"(grinning) So come on, let's test this puppy out. Think you can take me? (throws a few fake punches at Buffy. She mostly ignores him, walking farther into the room.) What's the matter, afraid of a little competition?"
BUFFY,It must have been so much work.
XANDER,"I'm the dummy man. (coming forward) I mean, I ... made the dummy. (gestures at it) The thing that you hit that doesn't hit back. (shrugs, looking embarrassed) That, I made."
BUFFY,It's great. (to Giles) I-it's all great.
GILES,"(putting his glasses back on) Well, you've earned it. Truly."
BUFFY,Thank you guys so much. You're like my ... fairy godmother and Santa Claus and Q all wrapped up into one.
BUFFY,"Q from Bond, not Star Trek."
BUFFY,I'm gonna go change.
SPIKE,"Oh Pacey, you blind idiot. Can't you see she doesn't love you?"
SPIKE,"Well, well, well. Looky here."
HARMONY,(anxiously) Is it safe? Has Buffy gotten to you yet? I saw her patrolling just now ... with a stake! (Spike pretends to look shocked) She won't give up until she's killed me to death!
SPIKE,(skeptical) Buffy's looking for you.
HARMONY,Of course! (walks forward) That's why I'm on the lam. Didn't you hear? I'm totally her arch-nemesis!
SPIKE,Is that right. I must have missed the memo.
HARMONY,"There was a mem-? (sighs) Spike, oh my god! This is like a real emergency! Uhh! (Spike grins) I need a hideout so bad. You're my only hope. We're just gonna have to rise above ... our petty differences... (looks anxiously at Spike) Listen, Spike ... I'm desperate."
SPIKE,"(still grinning, looking her up and down) Desperate, are you?"
HARMONY,"Come on, Spike. Pretty please? I'll do anything!"
SPIKE,"Anything, will you?"
HARMONY,Yeah! I said I'll do anything.
HARMONY,"Ohhhh. You mean will I have sex with you? (shrugs casually, like ""duh"") Well, yeah."
SPIKE,"Taking up smoking, are you?"
HARMONY,"I *am* a villain, Spike, hellooooo. (Takes a drag and starts to cough)"
SPIKE,I guess you are at that. What with the slayer on your tail and all.
SPIKE,"She's not the type to give up, either. She'll hunt you down, day and night, till you're too tired and too hungry to run any more. And then? (leans down to grab a handful of dust) Then... (dusting off his hands) that is you."
SPIKE,I guess you're gonna have to kill her.
HARMONY,(whining) I tried! It was all hard and stuff! (sits up) You do it.
SPIKE,"(looking down at her) I'd love to. But, I can't. Remember? I've got this cute little government chip in my head."
HARMONY,"(sighs) Oh, right. Guess it'll have to be me after all. (looks up at Spike again) Can you help with the thinking?"
SPIKE,(nods) Yeah. I suppose I could do that.
RILEY,Yeah.
BUFFY,"Mm, that was relaxing."
RILEY,"You, uh ... wanna relax some more? (Turns onto his side and snuggles up against her)"
BUFFY,Again? Right away again?
RILEY,Maybe you're too tired.
BUFFY,Hey. (reaches behind her to caress his cheek) I have the endurance of ten men.
RILEY,"Let's make it women, okay? (Buffy laughs) Just for the imagery."
BUFFY,"Whatever. You know, it takes a lot to wear me out. (turns toward him)"
RILEY,"Oh, I love a challenge."
BUFFY,Mm.
DAWN VOICEOVER,"Well, wouldn't you?"
DAWN,Every kid tries to make the substitute cry. It's like a rite of passage.
JOYCE,"I certainly would not. Being a substitute is an *extremely* difficult job. Besides... (looks at the bowls) Honestly, Dawn, how many bowls of cereal are you planning on eating?"
DAWN,"Oh, these aren't for eating. I'm just trying to get the extra out of the way so I could... (sticks her hand in cereal box, pulls out a toy) get this. (She smiles cheerfully at Joyce and sits down.) Anyway, (pointing to Joyce) I want eggs."
JOYCE,"You want the cereal prize, but you don't want the cereal. You *are* growing up. All righty, half an omelette coming up. (Scooping the eggs onto two plates)"
DAWN,"Oh, um, with ketchup if you please?"
JOYCE,Mm-hmm.
JOYCE,"(confused) Oh, what is the... (looks at Dawn) Who are you?"
BUFFY,Hey. How's Mom? Are you okay? (Hugs Dawn)
DAWN,I'm okay.
MAN,And your mom's doing just fine.
DAWN,(still sitting) This is Ben. He gave me his stethoscope.
BEN,"*Lent* you his stethoscope. Buffy, right? (holds out hand) I'm Ben, I'm an intern here. I've had the pleasure of hanging out with the renowned Dr. Dawn here while your mom's being tested. (Buffy shakes his hand)"
RILEY,So what's goin' on? What happened?
BEN,"Well, she's doing okay now ... the doctors don't really know what caused the collapse..."
BEN,"(muffled)... it could've just been a dizzy spell, low blood sugar, that sort of thing."
BUFFY,"But it's nothing bad. I, I mean it's not ... serious, right?"
BEN,(muffled) Very unlikely. So your mom doesn't have a ... history of fainting?
BUFFY,"(muffled) No. I mean, not that I know of. She's usually really healthy."
BEN,"(muffled) Well, I think they'll be running tests for a few more hours..."
BEN,"(muffled) ...then they'll probably want her to come back for some follow-up tests in a couple weeks, but it really doesn't look like anything too serious."
BUFFY,"Oh, thank god. I was freaking out."
BEN,(muffled) I think you'll be able to take her home before too long.
RILEY,"(muffled) Well, that is definitely good news."
DOCTOR,"I know I'm repeating myself here, but I don't know what else to say to convince you."
DOCTOR,I have never in all my years of medicine let a patient with tachycardia this severe leave a hospital.
RILEY,You said you couldn't keep me.
DOCTOR,"Legally, no, I can't force you to do a thing. (Riley nods and resumes buttoning his shirt) But with that pulse, believe me, I'd get on my knees and beg you if I thought I could change your mind."
RILEY,You can't. I'm going home.
DOCTOR,And your friend here can't convince you to-
RILEY,I'm going.
DOCTOR,"All right then, but you're leaving against my recommendation."
BUFFY,What's going on? What are you doing? What if you have a heart attack?
RILEY,(puts hands on her shoulders) Listen to me. Calm down.
BUFFY,*Me* calm down? I'm not the one with a pulse of a hundred and fifty.
RILEY,"My heart's different than yours, Buffy. It works differently now, but it's okay."
BUFFY,"But you're still a human, Riley. You could still have a heart attack."
RILEY,I'm a human who was used as a lab rat for months.
JOYCE,Hi.
BUFFY,Hey. How are you? (hurries over to hug Joyce)
JOYCE,"Oh ... embarrassed, mostly. I'm sorry to put you through this. But, no more tests, so you can take this pincushion home."
RILEY,"Yes. (comes forward) Let's, uh, get outta here."
WILLOW,"What about a crossword? Some people say feed a cold, I say puzzle it."
JOYCE,"Oh, no thanks, Willow."
DAWN,I like chicken fingers with mustard when I'm sick.
JOYCE,"(puts mug on coffee table) I know you do, sweetie. I can make us some later."
BUFFY,"Oh, uh-uh. You are sitting right here on this couch today."
JOYCE,I feel silly lying here like a lump!
WILLOW,"You could make a game out of it. A-a very quiet game, about being a lump."
JOYCE,"I feel fine. Honestly, I'm more concerned about Riley than I am about me."
BUFFY,"You shouldn't even be thinking about that. He's not worried, so I don't think we should be."
BUFFY,I don't get what he's thinking. (steps over Dawn as she paces around the bed) Why isn't he worried?
WILLOW,Maybe he thinks his body can handle it. He *is* in really good shape.
BUFFY,Nobody's body can handle a heart attack. (steps over Dawn to pace the other way again)
WILLOW,"I know. I'm sorry, Buffy. I'm trying too hard to make it okay."
BUFFY,(sighs) I just keep coming back to the Initiative.
WILLOW,It does have that icky government feel to it.
DAWN,Did you know that one time the CIA tried to kill Fidel Castro with poisonous aspirin?
BUFFY,"Dawn, please."
BUFFY,"I know I have to do something, I just don't know what."
DAWN,Another time the CIA-
BUFFY,Dawn!
DAWN,It's important.
DAWN,(quickly) Tried to make Castro go crazy by putting itching powder in his beard. (Buffy raises her eyebrows accusingly) It's about the government!
WILLOW,"Call the Initiative. If they know what's wrong with him, they have to help."
BUFFY,"Yeah, but call them how? First of all, they don't exist any more, and secondly, they never *claimed* to exist in the first place."
BUFFY,"(getting up) It's so unfair. I mean, i-it's like Big Brother can spy on you all the time, and-and the second I have something to say, no one will listen!"
DAWN,(muttering) Sounds more like Big Sister.
WILLOW,There has to be a way.
BUFFY,"Like what? Take a tour of the White House and pretend to get lost, and look for some door with a sign on it that says ""Secret Government Monster Hunters""?"
DAWN,"If they're really spying on you all the time, you just say something so you know they'll hear you. (Buffy looks thoughtful) Like sometimes, I write fake things in my diary in case... (trails off)"
BUFFY,"I gotta go. Uh, see you guys later."
DAWN,What'd I say?
BUFFY,Riley?
BUFFY,(into phone) Riley's in trouble. He needs help.
GUY,"No way, man."
RILEY,I'm out.
RILEY,Graham. (Keeps walking)
GRAHAM,"Riley. (We see Graham sitting on the bench, talking over his shoulder) Can we talk?"
GRAHAM,"Agent Goodman, Agent Brown."
RILEY,So talk.
GRAHAM,"What's goin' on, man? (Riley shrugs) You gotta get this taken care of immediately. We gotta get you into an operating room."
RILEY,Very convincing. Makes me completely wanna put myself under government control.
RILEY,Please take me where they can make me unconscious and naked.
GRAHAM,"Hey, you think I'd pull something on you?"
RILEY,You're still in. I'm out. I don't know what orders you're following.
GRAHAM,"Oh, come on. You know Walsh pumped all those chemicals and crap into us. You got more than anyone. She messed us up bad."
RILEY,(scornful) And now the government's knocking themselves out to kiss it and make it better.
GRAHAM,"Riley, I'm tellin' you, you need help. I'm not saying it to trick you."
RILEY,(shakes head) Maybe you even believe it.
GRAHAM,I know it. You don't want this.
RILEY,You're sure you got the fix for it?
GRAHAM,"Yeah. We got a guy, a doctor. He's gonna take care of you, and we're going to him now. (Riley nods) I'm not givin' you a choice."
RILEY,I guess you're not.
BUFFY,So you messed up and now he's gone and when are you even gonna tell me what's wrong with him?
GRAHAM,I'm not permitted to say.
BUFFY,Say.
GRAHAM,"(sighs) Hyperadrenal overload and a bunch of stuff that sounds even worse than that, and all it means is he's way stronger than he oughta be and feeling no pain. His heart can't take it. We've been at him for weeks about it."
GRAHAM,"There's a specialist waiting at Sunnydale General, fourth floor neurology. Get Riley there. If you don't-"
BUFFY,I'll get him there.
GRAHAM,(nods) I'll tell the doc.
GRAHAM,Buffy.
BUFFY,If you tell me to hurry ... I'll kick your ass.
WILLOW,Poor Riley.
GILES,Could he have simply gone back to his apartment?
BUFFY,"No, he's not at his apartment, he's not at the gym, he's not at the library ... he's gone somewhere where he doesn't wanna be found."
ANYA,So basically he's gone AWOL.
BUFFY,Basically exactly.
WILLOW,Poor Buffy.
XANDER,"Maybe he just needs some time alone. Like, I had this friend once, who really liked this girl, and ... he got all worried that maybe she didn't like him back... (Buffy and Giles look confused) and maybe that made him act like a total jerk. Maybe Riley reminds me of that friend."
WILLOW,What are you talking about?
XANDER,"Then again, maybe not. Maybe he just wants attention."
BUFFY,"Well, here's a hot tip, if you want attention? *Be* there so people can give it to you."
ANYA,"(softly) I care about you, Xander."
XANDER,(smiles confusedly) Thanks.
ANYA,(smiles) Don't be insecure.
XANDER,"(shrugs, shakes his head) Thanks ... I won't."
ANYA,"And, I also have this ""friend"" (making air-quotes) and, uh, I have it on really good authority that she really likes that guy, your ""friend"" (air-quotes) ... and, by the by, my friend-"
BUFFY,"You guys, enough! (Anya and Xander look embarrassed) Okay, Riley is in real danger here. (sighs) Anya, Xander, why don't you guys check the docks."
XANDER,Aye aye.
WILLOW,Tara and I can scope out the burned-out school. Riley hid there once. Maybe he ... feels it's homey or something.
BUFFY,"(thoughtful) Homey. You know what else he might find homey in a ... dank, unpleasant evil sort of way? (Giles sits in Xander's vacated seat) The Initiative caves. I don't know them too well."
GILES,(sipping tea) We do have an associate who knows those caves like the back of his ... melanin-deprived hand.
BUFFY,"(sighs) I *so* don't want to deal with Spike right now. That guy is really starting to bug me in that special ""I wanna shove something wooden through his heart"" kinda way."
WILLOW,He does seem extra twitchy lately. Maybe the whole not killing is gettin' to him.
BUFFY,"Plus hanging out all day in that moldy crypt, you just *know* he's doing something nasty."
SPIKE,"Okay, is it bigger than a breadbox?"
HARMONY,(smiling) No. Four left.
SPIKE,So it's smaller than a breadbox.
HARMONY,(giggling) No! Only three!
SPIKE,(quietly annoyed) Harmony ... is it a sodding breadbox?
HARMONY,(clapping and laughing) Yes! Oh my god! Someone's blondie bear is a twenty-question genius!
HARMONY,She's found me!
BUFFY,I've got a proposition for you.
SPIKE,"(jumping off the coffin) Funny, I've got a proposition for you, what about knocking? (Buffy ignores him, pulling out a wad of cash and unfolding it) Seems only fair since we vamps can't enter your flat without an invite, you could at least - Say, look at those pretty pieces of paper."
BUFFY,"Riley's sick with some Initiative thing and he's missing. I think he might be in the caves. You find him, bring him to the fourth floor of the hospital, their doctors get to him in time... (holds up the money) you get the cash."
SPIKE,"Oh, dear, is the enormous hall monitor sick? Tell me, is he gonna die?"
BUFFY,He is not the only person that can die.
SPIKE,"Hey. I'm just saying, if it's really that important to you, I think I'll get half now."
HARMONY,So? What'd she say about me?
OVERHEISER,Any word?
GRAHAM,They'll be here any minute.
GRAHAM,"That's soon enough, right? I mean, if we bring him in now?"
OVERHEISER,I'll be honest. I'm not sure it's soon enough if you brought him in yesterday.
GRAHAM,Finally.
SPIKE,"You got yourself a new patient, doc."
OVERHEISER,"Look, you don't understand. This is a complicated neurological procedure and I've never performed it before."
SPIKE,"Little performance anxiety, eh doc? (Takes off his jacket, sits on the operating table) Butterflies in the old belly? Harm, do us a favor. Shoot the nasty butterflies for the good doctor. (Overheiser looks from Harmony to Spike and moves toward the operating table) There you go. It's not so complicated. Just do whatever those Initiative lab monkeys did, only backwards."
OVERHEISER,"This is a medical school, not a proper operating facility, these instruments... (gesturing at the tray of instruments)"
SPIKE,(sighs) They look pointy enough. They'll do.
OVERHEISER,You're not listening. That chip is deeply imbedded in your cerebral cortex. Removing it could leave you a vegetable.
SPIKE,"That's not gonna happen, mate. See, I have faith in your survival instinct."
SPIKE: (smiling) Yeah. You'll have me up and killing before the night's over. (Note,"although it sounds like ""killing,"" and the closed-captions say ""killing,"" his lips clearly say ""fighting."")"
SPIKE,"Come on, doc! (nudges the doctor with his foot) You'll do me right. Nothing bad'll happen to you."
HARMONY,Oops. (grinning apologetically) String was slippy.
WILLOW VOICEOVER,(calling) Riley!
TARA,This place kinda creeps me out.
WILLOW,You shoulda been here when it was a school. (calls) Riley!
WILLOW,Oof. Darkness.
TARA,Piles of it. We shoulda brought a flashlight.
"WILLOW: Ooh! I know! (reaches into her bag) Better to light a candle than curse the damn darkness. (Smiles. Pulls a small bottle out of her bag) A little spell. (Shows it to Tara) <I>Fiat lux</I>! (Latin, translation","""let there be light"")"
TARA,Wow.
WILLOW,"There, that's better."
WILLOW,(calling) Riley! Come on out!
TARA,How'd you do that? With the light?
WILLOW,"Oh, you know. You taught me."
TARA,I taught you teeny Tinkerbell light.
WILLOW,"Okay, so I ... tinkered with the Tinkerbell. It was easy. And besides, isn't this better than ... using a flashlight like some kind of doofus?"
BUFFY,"Riley? Riley, answer me. (mutters softly) Please."
BUFFY,Riley?
RILEY,"(not looking at Buffy) You know, this doesn't even hurt."
BUFFY,Your hand is bleeding.
RILEY,(looks at her) Don't feel a thing.
BUFFY,This stops now. I'm taking you to the doctor.
RILEY,"The one from the government, you mean? Like the ones who did this to me in the first place? (Puts up a hand in a ""no thanks"" gesture and backs away)"
BUFFY,(moving toward him) He's the only one that understands what's wrong with you. He's the only one that can help.
RILEY,"What's wrong with me? I'm more powerful than I've ever been, Buffy. Most people would kill to feel this way."
BUFFY,"Yeah, and this feeling is *going* to kill you. Riley, your body was not built for this kind of strength-"
RILEY,"I can handle it. This is my deal, Buffy, just ... back off."
BUFFY,What is this?
BUFFY,What's happening to you?
RILEY,"I go back ... let the government get whimsical with my innards again ... They could do anything that- Best-case scenario, they turn me into Joe Normal, just... (sighs) Just another guy."
BUFFY,And that's not enough for you?
RILEY,It's not enough for *you*.
BUFFY,Why would you say that?
RILEY,Come on. Your last boyfriend wasn't exactly a civilian.
BUFFY,"So that's what this is about? You're going to die, all over some macho pissing contest."
RILEY,"(shakes his head) It's not about him. It's about us. (Buffy shakes her head, not understanding) You're getting stronger every day, more powerful. I can't touch you. Every day, you're just ... a little further out of my reach."
BUFFY,You wanna touch me? (walks toward him) I'm right here. I'm not the one running away.
RILEY,Not yet.
BUFFY,So you have this all figured out? I'm bailing because you're not in the super club.
RILEY,(shrugs) It's human nature.
BUFFY,"(angrily) Don't Psych 101 me. (Riley looks away) Not now. Not after everything that ... Nobody has ever known me the way you do. Nobody. (Riley doesn't look at her) I've opened up to you in ways that I've never opened up to ... God, you're just sitting back there thinking that none of this means anything to me."
RILEY,(still not looking at her) I never said that.
BUFFY,(teary-eyed) Because it obviously doesn't mean anything to you. Do you really think so little of me-
RILEY,Buffy.
BUFFY,"No! No. Do you think that I spent the last year with you because you had super powers? If that's what I wanted, then I'd be dating Spike. (quietly) Riley, I need you. (He looks at her, looks apprehensive) I need you with me ... and I need you healthy. But if you wanna throw it all away because you don't trust me, then ... (firmly) then I'm still gonna make you go to that doctor."
RILEY,Take me to him.
BUFFY,We have to hurry.
RILEY,"Loving you is the scariest thing I've ever done, Buffy."
BUFFY,I don't know why.
BUFFY,The doctor said we didn't have much time.
HARMONY,I read in a magazine that some women think a man's real sex organ is his brain.
HARMONY,"Yecch! No contest. I mean, look at it. It's so ... pink and wriggly-looking. (grins suddenly; to the doctor) Can I touch it?"
SPIKE/OVERHEISER,(unison) No!
HARMONY,"(looking over at Spike's face) Oh my god, you're awake?"
OVERHEISER,Local anesthetic.
HARMONY,"Wow, Spikey, how does it feel?"
SPIKE,"Like someone's cutting into my brain with a knife, you silly bint."
HARMONY,(to doctor) You know what it means that he can't hurt any living thing? It means he can't even pick flowers.
SPIKE,What? Yes I can!
OVERHEISER,(softly) Please be quiet.
HARMONY,Is it supposed to do that?
OVERHEISER,"Please. For god's sake, please, be quiet."
HARMONY,"Listen, buster. I don't see a crossbow in *your* hands, okay?"
SPIKE,"Harmony, if your incessant prattling bolloxes up this operation, I'm gonna personally yank out your pink and wriggly tongue."
HARMONY,What are you looking at?
BUFFY,Uh-oh.
RILEY,Graham. Graham. (Helps him sit up. Riley holds up two fingers) How many fingers I got?
GRAHAM,Seventeen.
GRAHAM,Hostile 17 and a blonde girl.
BUFFY,"(sighs) Spike and Harmony, together again."
GILES,Where's Dr. Overheiser?
BUFFY,"Uh, Spike must have taken him. What would Spike want with - (The clue hits) The chip. He's gonna force the doctor to remove the chip from his brain."
BUFFY,Riley?
RILEY,"(straightens up, breathlessly) I'm okay. Okay."
GRAHAM,"(to Buffy) We're running out of time. We don't find the medic soon, he's not gonna make it."
BUFFY,"(thinking fast) Okay, okay, brain surgery. He, he's gonna need a medical facility, he-he's gonna need, uh, uh, equipment..."
GRAHAM,This is a big hospital.
BUFFY,"No, uh-uh, he wouldn't do it here. It's too risky. We'll split up. Graham, get on the horn, or the ... pipe, or whatever you guys get on, I-I want you to check animal hospitals, doctors' offices..."
RILEY,"Hey, about before..."
GRAHAM,"We're good. Apologize later, if you're not dead."
BUFFY,(firmly) You are *not* going to die.
RILEY,Bet you say that to all the boys.
BUFFY,"No. There is one peroxided pest whose number is up. (They start to walk off) When I get my hands on Spike, I'm gonna rip his head off, I'm gonna..."
SPIKE,...bathe in the slayer's blood. Gonna dive in it. (with relish) Swim in it.
SPIKE,I'm gonna do the bloody backstroke.
HARMONY,"I see it, Spikey! I see the chip! It's nestled in there like ... a pretty little Easter egg with your brain all around it like that green plastic grassy stuff ... only this is more a beige, like-"
OVERHEISER,Would you please put out that cigarette? It's really not allowed.
HARMONY,Oh yeah? Says who?
HARMONY,"Oh god, sorry! Didn't see the sign!"
OVERHEISER,"The chip's out. (Harmony squeals excitedly) Didn't think I could do it, I just ... it's out."
SPIKE,Yeah?
HARMONY,"(jumping up and down, clapping) Yay! Yay for Spikey!"
SPIKE,"Right then. (determinedly) Stitch me up, doc. Got places to go. And slayers to kill."
SPIKE,"Listen to me. My stomach's growling, I'm so starved. (The doc looks nervous, begins to apply a bandage) I'm afraid I'm gonna have to have me a little snack."
SPIKE,"Oh, don't worry. I won't fill up on the bread. I'll still have plenty of room for the main course."
SPIKE,(fiercely) Slayer!
SPIKE,"Suit up, Harm."
BUFFY,Stay here. (She pushes him so he falls to the floor) We're gonna need you.
SPIKE,Buffy. I swear I was just thinking of you. I wanted to tell you the great news. My head's all clear now. No more bug-zapper in my noggin.
BUFFY,That means I get to kill you.
SPIKE,You get to try.
HARMONY,Oops.
SPIKE,At long last.
BUFFY,Riley!
BUFFY,Riley.
SPIKE,(looking at doctor) A penny?
OVERHEISER,(getting up) I told you I couldn't do it.
BUFFY,"Oh god. Doctor! Doctor, we need you *now*!"
SPIKE,"Buffy, Buffy, Buffy! Everywhere I turn, she's there! That nasty little face, that ... bouncing shampoo-commercial hair, that whole sodding holier-than-thou attitude."
HARMONY,"Well, aren't we kinda unholy, by the-"
SPIKE,"She follows me, you know, tracks me down. I'm her pet project. Drive Spike round the bend. Makes every day a fresh bout of torture."
HARMONY,Spike!
SPIKE,"You don't understand. I can't get rid of her. She's everywhere. She's haunting me, Harmony!"
SPIKE,(quietly) This ... has got to end.
OVERHEISER,All patched up.
BUFFY,How's it goin' in there?
RILEY,Good. Back to normal.
BUFFY,Yep.
BUFFY,And see ... I'm still touchable.
RILEY,"(nods) Give me a week or so to heal, and ... I'll take full advantage of that fact."
BUFFY,Are you gonna be okay? 'Cause I should really go check on my mom.
RILEY,"Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. I'll be fine."
BUFFY,I'll talk to you later.
GRAHAM,"It's a good thing Buffy found you when she did, 'cause you were about to detonate big-time. Always said she's pretty impressive."
RILEY,"You know, she really is."
GRAHAM,"But you know you don't belong here, right? (Keeps walking and talking although Riley has stopped walking and is staring at his back) This town? I mean, you're nothin' here."
RILEY,"Hey. (Graham stops walking, turns to look at him) What are you saying?"
GRAHAM,"Come on, man. You know it's true. There's nothing for you here."
RILEY,There's her.
GRAHAM,"Okay, right, there's her. And? You used to have a mission, and now you're what? The mission's boyfriend? Mission's true love?"
GRAHAM,You belong with us.
SPIKE,Should have known it's you. Been nearly six hours.
BUFFY,"Well, it would've been less if I wasn't busy cleaning up your mess."
SPIKE,"*My* mess? I just *borrowed* the doc. The mess is yours, Slayer. Yours and the boy's."
BUFFY,I'm done.
BUFFY,"Spike, you're a killer. And I shoulda done this *years* ago."
SPIKE,You know what? Do it. Bloody just do it.
BUFFY,What?
SPIKE,"End ... my ... torment. Seeing you, every day, everywhere I go, every time I turn around. Take me ... out of a world ... that has you in it! (Yanks off his shirt and throws it aside) Just kill me!"
BUFFY,(panting) Spike ... I want you.
SPIKE,"(muffled against her neck) Buffy, I love you."
SPIKE,"(OS) God, I love you so much."
SPIKE,"Oh, god, no."
SPIKE,"Please, no."
