Buffy,(yells out desperately) Nnnrrf! Nnnrrf!
Willow,"Oh, God! Demon! Demon! What kills a demon?!"
Buffy,Nnnrrf! Nnnrrf!
Willow,"(still searching) Oh, Nerf! Not Nerf. Knife!"
Buffy,"Okay. That was too close for comfort. Not that slaying is ever  comfy, but... you know what I mean? (takes a deep breath) If you guys  hadn't been here to help..."
Willow,"But, we were, and we did, and, and we're all fine. (looks down  at the monster) Isn't he gonna go poof?"
Buffy,"Mm, I guess these guys don't. We'll have to bury him or  something. Uhhf..."
Buffy,"Makes you appreciate vamps, though. No fuss, no muss."
Xander,So how come Faith was a no-show? I thought mucus-y demons were  her favorites. (munches on a snack)
Buffy,Couldn't reach her... again. She hasn't been hanging out much.  (reaches for a snack)
Xander,I detect worry.
Buffy,A little bit. Slaying's a rough gig. Too much alone time isn't  healthy. Stuff gets pent up. (munches the snack)
Willow,We should try to do more socializing with her.
Xander,"Well, burial detail aside, does this cap us off for the day?"
Buffy,You got plans?
Xander,I cannot stress enough how much I *don't* have plans.
Buffy,No luck reaching Cordelia?
Xander,"I've left a few messages. Sixty... Seventy... But you know what  really bugs me? (to Willow) Okay, we kissed. It was a mistake. But I  know that was positively the last time we were *ever* gonna kiss."
Willow,Darn tootin'!
Xander,"And they burst in, rescuing us, without even knocking? I mean,  this is really *all* their fault."
Buffy,Your logic does *not* resemble our Earth logic.
Xander,Mine is much more advanced.
Willow,"At least tomorrow's Monday, another school day."
Buffy,"Well, that's good. You know, focus on school. That's the strong  Willow way to heal."
Willow,"Actually, I was more thinking Oz will be there, and I can beg  for forgiveness."
Buffy,"That works, too."
Willow,"I-I wanna be strong Willow. But then I think I may never get to  be close to Oz again, and it's like all the air just goes out of the  room."
Buffy,I know the feeling.
Xander,"Right. I mean, you went through it with Angel, and you're still  standing. So tell us, Wise One, how do you deal?"
Buffy,I have you guys.
Machine,"Hey, it's Xander. If you get this, call me."
Machine,"Hi! Xander. I, uh... Well, I'm in if you feel like calling.  Bye."
Machine,"Hi, Cordelia. Um... If you get the chance, if we could talk,  I'm here."
Machine,Hey again! It's me. I'm here. Again.
Buffy,How's it goin'?
Willow,"Oz hasn't been to his locker. There may be books in there that  he needs, but still, he doesn't come. (looks at the locker)"
Buffy,Has Xander seen Cordelia?
Willow,I don't think so. But she is coming in today. Amy saw her last  night at the mall. (looks at the locker)
Buffy,How was she?
Willow,I don't know. Amy said she looked pretty... scary.
Harmony,Cordelia! You look amazing.
Harmony,"Oh. You have to meet Anya. (pulls her to the front) She just  moved here, and her dad just bought -- what was it -- oh. A utility. Or  something."
Anya,(to Cordelia) Nice bag. Prada?
Cordelia,Good call! Most people around here can't tell Prada from  Payless.
Harmony,"God, Cordy, when I heard about... Well, I mean, I couldn't  believe it. But it was smart. You know, the injury thing? You take a  week off, let everybody forget about the temporary insanity that was  Xander Harris."
Cordelia,(raises her eyebrows) Xander who?
Harmony,Oh!
Cordette,You know what you have to do. Start dating. Get back on the  horse.
Cordelia,"Oh, absolutely! I am ready to ride!"
Harmony,Then I have just the stallion. He's *so* you.
Harmony,"(giggles) I'm pretty sure he won't cheat on you. At least not  for a while. Plus, he's got a kill moped."
Willow,Oz! Wow.
Willow,"Look at us, running into each other, as two people who go to  the same school are so likely to do now and then."
Oz,Hey. (starts to leave)
Willow,"(stops him) Oz, wait. Please?"
Willow,What I did... When I think that I hurt you...
Oz,Yeah. You said all this stuff already.
Willow,"Right, but... I wanna make it up to you. I mean, if you let me,  I wanna try."
Oz,Just... You can leave me alone. I need to figure things out.
Willow,"But maybe if we talk about it, we could..."
Oz,Look... I'm sorry this is hard for you. But I told you what I need.  So I can't help feeling like the reason you want to talk is so you can  feel better about yourself. That's not my problem.
Cordelia,"Hey, John Lee. Do I have something caught in my teeth?"
Cordelia,"So... What's new? God, it's been, like, a gazillion years!"
Cordelia,(surprised to find the tables turned) What?
Anya,(smiles) Hey.
Cordelia,Go ahead. Dazzle me with your oh-so-brilliant insults. Just  join the club.
Anya,"Hardly. Uh, actually, I've been looking for you. Ever since we  met this morning, I was, like, thank God there's one other person in  this town who actually reads W."
Cordelia,But Harmony...
Anya,"Oh, she follows me around. If that girl had an original thought,  her head would explode."
Cordelia,(notices Anya's pendant) Is that Gucci?
Anya,"Um... no. It's an actual old thing, sort of a, um... good luck  charm my dad gave me."
Cordelia,Too bad I didn't have one of those pre-Xander.
Anya,Can I just say... Men.
Cordelia,Second it.
Anya,"Apart from being without class, the guy's obviously blind.  Deserves whatever he gets."
Cordelia,I'm not even thinking about him. I am past it. I am living my  life.
Anya,"Still, I mean... Don't you kinda wish..."
Cordelia,"I don't wish. I act. Starting now, Xander Harris is gonna get  a bellyful of just how over him I am."
Xander,Excuse me. I need to be both giving *and* receiving of mirth.  Is it too much to ask for a little backup?
Buffy,"(puts her hand on his knee) I'm here for you, Xand. I'm Support- O-Gal. (takes her hand back) I just... feel a little weird about this  us-against-Cordelia thing. She's had a rough time."
Willow,"It's true. Cordelia *belongs* to the justified camp. She  *should* make us pay. And pay and pay and pay... In fact, there's just  not enough pay for what we..."
Xander,"(interrupts) Look, you want to do guilt-a-palooza, fine, but  I'm done with that. Starting this minute, I'm gonna grab ahold of that  crazy little thing called life and let it do its magical little heal-y  thing. What's done is done. Let's be in the moment. Behold the beauty  that is now. (bounces his eyebrows) Who's with me?"
Buffy,He's actually making sense. We're young and free in America. How  dare we be spun by love or the lack of same?
Willow,Absolutely. I-it's self-indulgent. I-I'm in. I'm on the joy  train. (smiles)
Buffy,That didn't work. Who wants chocolate?
Buffy,I'm up.
Xander,"Look at her. (indicates Cordelia) Tears of a clown, baby. Or is  it... grins of a sad person? (reaches over to Willow in his old familiar  way) Or maybe it's..."
Willow,"Xander, your hand."
Xander,"(jerks back his hand) Oops! Sorry. But why 'oops'? I mean, we  always touch digits. It's a friend thing. Comfort. Like chocolate."
Willow,"(shrugs) Maybe it used to be, but since we... It's different.  (Xander looks away) I-I'm sorry. But if I wanna make things right with  Oz, my hands, (Xander looks back) my -- all my stuff -- has to be for  him only."
Buffy,"Hey, Cordelia, wait a second."
Cordelia,(stops and faces her) Did Xander send you to beg for him?  Because if he did...
Buffy,"No. I'm a free agent, I promise. I just wanted to see how you  are."
Cordelia,Never been better. (starts to go)
Buffy,"(follows) Cordelia, I know what it's like to be hurt by someone.  (Cordelia faces her) Hurt so much that you don't think you're gonna make  it. But I told my friends how I felt, and you know what? It got a little  better."
Buffy,"Cordelia, look..."
Buffy,...out.
Cordelia,"You know what I've been asking myself a *lot* this last week?  Why me? Why do *I* get impaled? Why do *I* get bitten by snakes? Why do  *I* fall for incredible losers? And you know, I think I've finally  figured it out, what my problem is? It's..."
Cordelia,...Buffy Summers. That's when all my troubles started.  (winces in pain and holds her side) When she moved here.
Anya,Are you okay?
Cordelia,"Oh, I just pulled some stitches last night. Know why? (looks  in Buffy's direction) Surprise. It was Buffy's fault."
Harmony,"Oh, hey, it's Garbage Girl. Loved the look last night, Cor.  Dumpster chic for the dumped."
Anya,Here. I think you need this more than I do right now.
Cordelia,"Yeah, I can use some luck. (eyes Buffy) And a stick with  pointy, sharp bits. If that Buffy wasn't... I swear. She's a pain."
Anya,"But Xander, he's an utter loser. Don't you wish..."
Cordelia,I never would've looked twice at Xander if Buffy hadn't made  him marginally cooler by hanging with him.
Anya,Really? (looks over at Buffy)
Cordelia,"Yeah, I swear! I wish Buffy Summers had never come to  Sunnydale."
Anyanka,Done.
Cordelia,Anya?
Cordelia,"'I wish Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale.' (smiles)  She was, like... a good fairy. A scary, veiny... good fairy. (smiles  widely)"
Harmony,Where have you been?!
Harmony,Ted Chervin just totally went for third with Ginger in front  of everybody.
Cordette,(to Cordelia) Love the dress. It's so daring.
Cordelia,Yeah?
Cordelia,(considers her response) I'll get back to you.
Cordelia,Yeah. (smiles)
Harmony,"Cordy, you reign!"
Cordelia,"I do? I mean, I do. So what's with the Winter Brunch thing?"
Teacher,"Alright. Now, don't forget, tomorrow we have our, uh, monthly  memorial, so, uh, there's no class."
Cordelia,What's the rush?
Harmony,"Oh, you know, my mom hates it when I'm late."
Cordelia,Since when? Aren't we going out tonight? (gets up)
Cordette,Curfew starts in an hour.
Cordelia,"Curfew? Come on, I'm in a really good mood! Let's go to the  Bronze!"
Harmony,Is that a joke?
Cordelia,Oh! The Bronze isn't cool in this reality. I've gotta make  these little adjustments. (smiles)
Harmony,"Cordy, what's with you? (the others leave) I mean, you wear  this come-bite-me outfit, you make jokes about the Bronze, and you're  acting a little schizo."
Cordelia,"You're right. I just... Well, I bumped my head yesterday, and  I keep forgetting stuff. Not that I care, but Xander Harris, he's  miserable, right? And that Willow freak he hangs with, not even a blip  on the radar screen, right? (smiles)"
Harmony,"(confused) Well, yeah. They're dead."
Cordelia,Okay. Not funny. (stops a passing janitor) Hey! You! Where  did you put my car?
Janitor,Pardon?
Cordelia,My auto! El convertablo?
Janitor,"You students aren't allowed to drive, and you know it."
Cordelia,What?!
Janitor,"Go on now, Miss. You better get in before the sun sets."
Xander,"Well, whadaya know? Cordelia Chase."
Cordelia,What is this? Some kind of sick joke? Harmony told me you  were dead.
Xander,"(plays her game) Now, why would she say something like that?  Let's think."
Cordelia,"Listen to me. We have to find Buffy. She'll figure out a way  to save us. She was supposed to be here, and as much as it kills me to  admit it... things were better when she was around."
Xander,Buffy? The Slayer?
Cordelia,No! Buffy the dog-faced girl! Duh! Who do you think I'm  talking about?
Willow,Bored now.
Willow,This is the part that's less fun. When there isn't any  screaming.
Cordelia,What's up with you two and the leather?
Willow,(to Xander) Play now?
Xander,"It's not that I don't appreciate your appetite, Will, but I  thought we agreed it was my turn."
Cordelia,"No. No! No way! I wish us into Bizarro Land, and you guys are  still together?! I cannot win!"
Xander,Probably not. (vamps out) But I'll give you a head start.
Cordelia,(gasps) No!
Willow,I love this part.
Xander,You love all the parts.
Willow,No fun. She didn't even hardly fight.
Xander,"Aw, swell. It's the White Hats."
Giles,I've got them! Get the girl!
Oz,How's she doing?
Giles,Her pulse is strong.
Nancy,What was she doing wearing that? Everyone knows that vampires  are attracted to bright colors.
Larry,That's Cordelia. It's better to look good than to feel alive.
Giles,"Uh, go and, uh, watch the perimeters in case they follow."
Xander,"(to the vampire) Slap my hand, dead soul man."
Master,Ahh. Xander... Willow... Hungry?
Master,"(disgustedly) I've lost my appetite for this one. She keeps  looking at me. I'm trying to eat, and she *looks* at me."
Master,Go on!
Master,I remember that lust for the kill. (sits back down on his  throne) Now... What news on the Rialto?
Xander,"Had a prime kill. An old crush, actually, till that wannaslay  librarian showed up."
Master,He'll be dealt with soon enough.
Xander,Weird thing: girl kept talking about Buffy. 'Gotta get Buffy  here.' Isn't that what they called the Slayer?
Willow,(strokes his chest) Hmm. Buffy. Ooo. Scary.
Xander,Someone has to talk to her people. That name is striking fear  in nobody's hearts.
Master,"(stands up) She talked of summoning the Slayer here, now, at  this time, and you didn't kill her?"
Willow,"Well, they had crosses."
Master,The plant begins operation in less than twenty-four hours.  (steps up to them) You will find this girl. (strokes their cheeks) You  will kill her before she contacts the Slayer. Or I'll see you two  kissing daylight.
Giles,Hey! Hey...
Cordelia,(frantic) Giles! It's all my fault! I wasn't... I made this  *stupid* wish...
Giles,Come on. Please lie...
Cordelia,"No! You have to get Buffy. Buffy changes it. (Giles lets go  of her) It wasn't like this. It was better. I mean, the clothes alone...  (Giles takes off his glasses) But people were happy. Mostly. And...  Wait. (slides off of the table) Why are you here and she's not? I mean,  y-you were her Watcher."
Giles,H-how do you know I was a Watcher? I've never...
Cordelia,What?
Cordelia,What?
Giles,I thought I heard something.
Giles,"Now, I want you to start again and explain everything very  carefully."
Willow,You're in a big cage.
Xander,"Not too bright, Book Guy."
Xander,"So you're a Watcher, huh? (smiles widely) Watch this."
Larry,They hit us right outside.
Giles,Nancy?
Oz,She's dead.
Giles,Um... Would you mind... Could you take her to the incinerator? I  have some business to...
Giles,Wait a moment.
Xander,The deed is done.
Master,You killed the girl that sought the Slayer?
Xander,It was too easy.
Willow,I felt cheap.
Master,Excellent. The opening will commence as scheduled. (takes  another sip)
Willow,"(approaches) So, you're pleased?"
Master,Ecstatic.
Willow,Then... can I play with the puppy?
Master,Ooo. (smiles) Be my guest.
Giles,"Yes, I understand, but it's imperative that I see her. Here.  (listens) Well... when will you? (listens) Yeah, well, you are her  Watcher. I'd expect her to at least check in to... (listens) Yes, I'm  aware that there's a great deal of demonic activity in Cleveland.  (listens) It... Well, it happens, you know, that, that Sunnydale is on a  Hellmouth. (listens) It, it is so! (listens) Well... Just... Just give  her the message, if you ever see her again. (hangs up)"
Willow,Bored now.
Willow,Daytime's the worst. (runs her hand over the leather) Cooped up  for hours. Can't hunt.
Willow,But the Master said I could play.
Willow,"Isn't that fun, Puppy?"
Willow,Aw... Puppy's being all quiet. Come on. Don't be a spoilsport.
Willow,Guess what today is?
Willow,Today the plant opens. It's a big party.
Willow,"You remember I told you about the plant? All those people you  tried to save? It's gonna be quick for them. Not for you, though. It's  gonna be slow for you."
Willow,"That's right, Puppy... Willow's gonna make you bark. (smiles)"
Willow,Oh... Maybe I went too hard on you last time.
Xander,Too hard? No such thing.
Willow,Watch it with those things. You almost got my hair.
Xander,Sorry. Got carried away.
Willow,Don't you want to?
Xander,"No, thanks, baby. I just wanna watch you go."
Giles,Here it is! I've found it. (comes out of his office) Look.
Giles,"It's what, um, Cordelia was wearing. It's the, the, uh, symbol  of, of Anyanka."
Oz,I don't think I know her.
Giles,"Well, no. Um, Anyanka is a, sort of a Patron Saint of scorned  women. (sits on the table)"
Larry,What does she do?
Giles,"Uh, sh-she grants wishes."
Oz,"So Cordelia wished for something? Well, if it was a long, healthy  life, she should get her money back."
Giles,"She said something about everything being different, that the...  the world wasn't supposed to be like this. It was, um, better. Before."
Larry,"Okay. The entire world sucks because some dead ditz made a wish?  (gets looks from Giles and Oz) I just, I just want it clear."
Giles,"She said the, uh... the Slayer was supposed to be here, was, um,  meant to have been here already."
Oz,Certainly would've helped.
Giles,"Yes. I tried calling her, but, um... (stands up) Look, I'm, I'm,  I'm gonna have to... research this Anyanka thing further. Um, I have  some more... volumes at, at home. You two, two get some sleep. (goes)"
Oz,Watch your back.
Giles,Run!
Giles,Buffy Summers?
Buffy,That's right. Wanna tell me what I'm doing here?
Giles,"Ah! Ah! Ah! Yes! (glances at Buffy and stands up) Here. (reads)  'In order to defeat Anyanka, one must destroy her powercenter. (walks  down the steps) This should reverse all the wishes she's granted,  rendering her mortal and powerless again.' You see? Without her  powercenter, she'd j-just be a-a-an ordinary woman again, and all this  would be, um... well, different. (gets no reaction) Well, I'd say that  my, my Watcher muscles (closes the book) haven't completely atrophied  after all. (takes off his glasses)"
Buffy,(unimpresssed) Great. What's her powercenter?
Giles,"Um, well, um, um... (glances at the book again) It doesn't say."
Buffy,Why don't I just put a stake through her heart? (goes to his  kitchen bar)
Giles,She's not a vampire.
Buffy,"Mm, well, you'd be surprised how many things that'll kill.  (sniffs a liqueur bottle)"
Giles,"I don't want to kill her, Miss Summers. I want to reverse  whatever effect she's had on this, this... world."
Buffy,"You're taking an awful lot on faith here, Jeeves."
Giles,Giles.
Buffy,"(shrugs) Kill the bad fairy... destroy the bad fairy's  powercenter, whatever, and all the troubles go away?"
Giles,"Yeah, well, I'm sure it's not that simple, but..."
Buffy,(interrupts) World is what it is. We fight. We die. Wishing  doesn't change that.
Giles,I have to believe in a better world.
Buffy,Go ahead. I have to live in this one.
Giles,Cordelia said she knew that I was meant to be your Watcher. She  said she knew you.
Buffy,(works her spit into the leather) She's probably just a big fan.
Giles,"The Master sent his most vicious disciples to kill her. Now,  she, she must have posed some threat to him. (puts his glasses back on)"
Buffy,(suddenly attentive) The Master?
Giles,"Um, supreme vampire around these parts. He, he lives on the  outskirts of town in an old club."
Buffy,"You know where he lives, and no one's ever tried to take him  out?"
Giles,People have tried.
Buffy,"Well, point the way. I might as well do some good while I'm in  this town. (goes to get her weapons)"
Giles,You can't just walk in there and...
Buffy,"Look, you wanna stay here and play make-believe, fine. (puts her  crossbow strap over her shoulder) I'm not gonna be any help to you  anyway. There's only one thing I'm good at."
Giles,At least let's muster some kind of force.
Buffy,"I don't play well with others. Now, I'm gonna ask you this once,  and then I'm gonna get testy."
Buffy,Where's this club?
Angel,Buffy.
Angel,Buffy Summers.
Angel,(weakly) It's you. I mean... you don't remember. How could you?
Buffy,How did you know my name?
Angel,I waited. I waited here for you. But you never... I was supposed  to help you.
Buffy,(huffs) You were gonna help me.
Angel,(weakly) The Master rose. He let me live... to punish me. I kept  hoping maybe you'd come. My destiny.
Buffy,(huffs) Is this a get-in-my-pants thing? You guys in Sunnydale  talk like I'm the Second Coming.
Angel,I'm sorry. I just meant...
Buffy,"(interrupts) Look, I don't have time for stories. Where's the  Master?"
Angel,They're at his factory. It starts tonight.
Buffy,Factory?
Angel,(tries to move) I (grunts) I can take you there.
Buffy,"Oh, you gotta be *kidding* me!"
Angel,Wait! I won't hurt you.
Buffy,(faces him) No. You'll leave that to your Master.
Angel,You don't believe I wanna help you?
Angel,Believe I want him dead.
Master,"Vampires, come! Behold the technical wonder, which is about to  alter the very fabric of our society. Some have argued that such an  advancement goes against our nature. They claim that death is our art. I  say to them... Well, I don't say anything to them because I kill them.  Undeniably we are the world's superior race. (the camera closes in on  him) Yet we have always been too parochial, too bound by the mindless  routine of the predator. Hunt and kill, hunt and kill. Titillating? Yes.  Practical? Hardly. Meanwhile, the humans, with their plebeian minds,  have brought us a truly demonic concept: (spreads his arms) mass  production!"
Vampires,(cheer) Yeah! Yeah!
Xander,We really are living in a golden age.
Giles,Oh... Anyanka... I-I beseech thee... (puts on his glasses to  read) Um... (turns a page) In the name of all women scorned... (adds  more herb to the fire) Come before me.
Giles,Oh! (lets out a nervous breath)
Anyanka,Do you have any idea what I do to a man who uses that spell to  summon me?
Master,Bring on the first!
Vampire,You!
Cordette,Nooo! No! Please! No! Help me! No! Noooo!
Master,"She's still alive, you see, for the freshness."
Angel,(to Buffy) What's the plan?
Buffy,(holds up her stake) Don't fall on this.
Master,Welcome to the future.
Vampires,To the future! To the future! To the future!
Willow,(smiling) Uh-oh. Puppy got out.
Giles,Cordelia Chase. What did she wish for?
Anyanka,I had no idea her wish would be so exciting! Brave New World.  I hope she likes it.
Giles,You're gonna change it back.
Giles,I'm not afraid of you. Your only power lies in the wishing.
Anyanka,Wrong!
Angel,"Buffy, look out!"
Angel,Buffy...
Anyanka,This is the real world now.
Anyanka,This is the world we made. Isn't it wonderful?
Anyanka,You trusting fool! How do you know the other world is any  better than this?
Giles,Because it has to be.
Anyanka,No!
Cordelia,I wish Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale.
Anya,Done.
Cordelia,"That would be cool! No, wait. I wish Buffy Summers had never  been born."
Anya,Done!
Cordelia,"And I wish that Xander Harris never again knows the touch of  a woman. (smiles, starts to walk away) *And* that Willow wakes up  tomorrow covered in monkey hair."
Anya,(tries again) Done!
Cordelia,"In fact, I wish all men except maybe the dumb and the really  agreeable kind..."
Cordelia,...disappear off the face of the earth. That would be *so*  cool! Or maybe...
