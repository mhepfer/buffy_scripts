Anya,(shocked) But... But I...
Anya,I was robbed of them.
Anya,(dramatically) For a thousand years I wielded the powers of The  Wish. I brought ruin to the heads of unfaithful men. I brought forth  destruction and chaos for the pleasure of the lower beings. I was feared  and worshipped across the mortal globe. (disgustedly) And now I'm stuck  at Sunnydale High. (despondently) Mortal. Child. And I'm flunking math.
Anya,(pleadingly) Give me another chance. You can fold the fabric of  time. Send me back to that place and I'll change it. I won't fail again.
Anya,"(desperately) Do you have any idea how boring twelfth graders  are? (stands up) I'm getting my power center back. (defiantly) And if  you won't help me, then, by the pestilent gods, I will find someone who  will!"
Buffy,"The Watcher Council shrink is heavy into tests. He's got tests  for everything. T.A.T.s, Rorschach, associative logic... (grunts and  sits up) He even has that test to see if you're crazy that asks if you  ever hear voices or you ever wanted to be a florist."
Willow,"(looks over at Buffy) Ooo, I used to want... (reconsiders)  Wait. Florist means crazy, right? (turns back to her pencil) I never  wanted to do that."
Buffy,"(smiles, impressed) Neat."
Willow,"(grins) Thanks. It's all about emotional control. Plus,  obviously, magic. (looks at Buffy, giddily) Hey, you wanna go to the  Espresso Pump and get sugared up on mochas?"
Buffy,I'm gonna pass. Hit the pool and do some laps.
Willow,"(bewildered) How come the sudden calisthenics? Aren't you sort  of naturally buff, Buff? (smiles and giggles) Buff buff."
Buffy,"Well, they've got us running around on the physical side, too. A  lot of reflex evaluation and precision training, you know. I-I just...  Well, I-I wanna do..."
Willow,(smiles knowingly) Better than Faith?
Buffy,(embarrassed) So very shallow.
Willow,"(sits up) Competition is natural and healthy. Plus, you'll  definitely ace her on the psych tests. Just don't mark the box that  says, 'I sometimes like to kill people.'"
Buffy,"(ruefully) I know Faith's not gonna be on the cover of Sanity  Fair, but... she had it rough. Different circumstances, that could be  me."
Willow,(shakes her head) No way. Some people just don't have that in  them.
Buffy,"(apologetically) Look, I'm sorry. I-I know how you hate talking  about Faith."
Willow,"No, it's okay."
Buffy,"No, really, we should just... (glances at the pencil)"
Willow,No. I-it doesn't bother me. I mean it.
Buffy,"(notices the pencil) Uh, Will?"
Willow,(looks at it) Oh.
Buffy,Emotional control?
Willow,(abashed) I'm working on it.
Snyder,"As far as I'm concerned, this is a marriage made in heaven.  (takes off his jacket) Willow Rosenberg, despite her unsavory  associations, (hangs it on the coat rack) represents the pinnacle of  academic achievement at Sunnydale High. (strolls up to them) Percy West  represents a devastating fast break (puts his hand on Percy's shoulder)  and 50% from behind the three-point line. (goes around his desk to his  chair)"
Willow,(confused) I-I'm not sure I understand the marriage part.  (glances at Percy)
Snyder,"(indicates Willow) You've got the brains, (indicates Percy)  he's got the fast break. (brings his hands together) It's a perfect  match."
Willow,(very confused) Match? (double-takes at Percy) You want us to  breed?
Snyder,I want you to tutor him. (sits) Percy is flunking history.  Nothing seems to be able to motivate him.
Percy,"(flippantly) Hey, I'm *challenged*."
Snyder,"(raises his eyebrows) You're lazy, self-involved and spoiled.  That's quite the challenge. But we need a winning year, especially after  last year's debacle with the swim team. Can't have our point guard  benched. (to Willow) So, you're gonna take on a little teaching job.  (encouragingly) I know how you enjoy teaching."
Willow,"(makes feeble excuses) Well, I have a lot of work of my own."
Snyder,You've got a letter of acceptance from every university with a  stamp.
Willow,"Y-yes, but I still have classes and I don't..."
Snyder,"(interrupts) Rosenberg, it's time to give something back to the  community. (stands up) I know you wanna help your school out here. Ask  me how I know."
Willow,(obediently) How do you...?
Snyder,"(interrupts, glares ominously) I just... know."
Buffy,So he threatened you? With what?
Willow,"Well, i-it wasn't exactly anything he said. It was all in his  eyes. I mean, there was some nostril work as well, but mostly eyes."
Buffy,Snyder needs me to kick his ass.
Willow,"Oh, no, Buffy, don't get in trouble. I'll be okay."
Willow,I just hate the way he bullies people. He just assumes  everyone's time is his.
Giles,"Willow, get on the computer. I want you to take another pass at  accessing the Mayor's files."
Willow,(happily) Okay.
Faith,"(sarcastically) Well, that was a blast."
Giles,How did it go?
Faith,(points at Wesley behind her) Princess Margaret here had a  little trouble keeping up.
Giles,(to Wesley) How did it go?
Wesley,"(panting heavily) Faith, uh... (pants) did quite well on the  obstacle field. (pants) Still a little sloppy, though."
Giles,"Do you feel up to, uh, taking Buffy out, or shall I?"
Wesley,"(pants) Oh, no, no, no. (pants) I'll be fine. (pants) Just give  me a minute. (pants) And some defibrillators, if it's (pants) not too  much trouble."
Faith,"You're gonna love it, B. It's just like fun, only boring.  (grimaces)"
Giles,"(sternly) Faith, this evaluation is a necessary part of the  Council's..."
Faith,(apologetically) I know. I'm on board here. Just shooting my  mouth off.
Buffy,I better change.
Faith,Good luck.
Faith,What cha doin'?
Willow,(trying to concentrate) I'm trying to access the Mayor's  personal files.
Faith,(surprised) Can you do that?
Willow,"Well, he's got some tricky barriers set up."
Faith,(warily) Can you get past 'em?
Willow,(stubbornly) Eventually I'll get through.
Faith,"Yeah, I thought so, too. (looks around) Are you serious about  this place? (continues exploring)"
Faith,"(checks out the kitchen) Yeah, plus all the screwing. This place  is the kick!"
Faith,"(smiling sultrily) Thanks, Sugar Daddy."
Faith,(grins broadly) No way.
Oz,Hey!
Willow,Oz! Hi!
Oz,There's something about you that's causing me to hug you.  (teasingly) It's like I have no will of my own.
Willow,Where were you yesterday?
Oz,"Mm... We got back late, sort of very."
Willow,(perplexed) We? Who? Where?
Oz,The band. We had a gig in Monterey Sunday night.
Willow,"(distressed) Oh, you did? How come I didn't know?"
Oz,(surprised) I thought you did.
Willow,(hurt) Maybe I would have liked to go.
Oz,Didn't figure you for missing school.
Willow,(disappointed) You think I'm boring.
Oz,I'd call that a radical interpretation of the text. We're playing  tonight at the Bronze.
Willow,(apologetically) I can't. I have too much homework.
Oz,(invitingly) If you get done early...
Willow,"Percy! Hey. Listen, I thought we could get together today at  lunch and go over your Roosevelt paper. You know, what books you'll need  and stuff."
Percy,(purposely obtuse) What are you talking about?
Willow,"Me tutoring you. Your, your history paper?"
Percy,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Snyder said *you* were gonna do it."
Willow,(surprised) He never said that.
Percy,(gives her an obnoxious look) What meeting were *you* at?
Willow,"Look, I-I'll get the books you need. Just meet me at lunch  and..."
Percy,"(interrupts) No, no, no. I don't have any time at lunch. I gotta  hang out."
Willow,Well...
Percy,"(stops and faces her, impatiently) What, what, you got something  better to do? Just type it up and put my name on it. Oh, and don't type  too good. Dead giveaway. (leaves)"
Willow,"(with resolve) I'm eating this now. (daringly) It's not  lunchtime, I don't even care."
Buffy,Hey.
Xander,"Willow, did you remember to tape Biography last Friday?"
Willow,(absently) Uh-huh. (struggles with the banana)
Buffy,"(to Xander, proudly) See, I told you. Old Reliable."
Willow,"(sourly) Oh, thanks."
Buffy,(taken aback) What?
Willow,"'Old Reliable'? Yeah, great. (reprovingly) *There's* a sexy  nickname."
Buffy,"Well, I-I didn't mean it as..."
Willow,"No, it's fine. I'm 'Old Reliable'."
Xander,"She just means, you know, the geyser. You're like a geyser of  fun that goes off at regular intervals."
Willow,(disgustedly) That's Old Faithful.
Xander,"Isn't that the dog that, that the guy had to shoot..."
Willow,(incensed) That's Old Yeller.
Buffy,"Xander, I beg you not to help me. Will, I-I didn't mean it as a  bad thing. I-I think it's good to be reliable."
Willow,"(stands up, annoyed) Well, maybe I don't *wanna* be reliable  all the time. Maybe I'm not just some doormat person. Homework Gal."
Xander,I'm thinking nerve strike.
Willow,Maybe I'll change my look! Or cut class. You don't know.
Willow,(holds up her banana defiantly) And I'm eating this banana.  Lunchtime be damned! (strides off)
Buffy,"(goes after her) Will, wait. I'm really sorry..."
Willow,"(interrupts, chiding gently) Buff, I'm storming off. It doesn't  really work if you come with me."
Buffy,(chastened) Oh.
Anya,"Uh, Willow?"
Willow,"(turns around) Uh, hi. (doesn't recognize)"
Anya,"(gestures at herself) Anya. (smiles) I'm sort of new here.  (hopefully) Um, I know Cordelia?"
Willow,"(smiles thinly) Oh, fun."
Anya,"Yeah. Um, listen, (steps up closer to her) I have this little  project I'm working on, and I heard you were the person to ask if..."
Willow,"(interrupts, ironically) Yeah, that's me. Reliable-Dog-Geyser  Person. What do you need?"
Anya,"Oh, it's nothing big. (secretively) Just a little spell I'm  working on. (shrugs)"
Willow,"(suddenly interested, steps down to her) A spell?  (nonchalantly) Oh. I like the black arts."
Anya,"I just need a secondary to create a temporal fold. I heard you  were a pretty powerful wicca, so... (shrugs again)"
Willow,"(smiles excitedly) You heard right, mister! I-I-I'm always  ready to work some dark mojo. (hopefully) So, tell me, is it dangerous?"
Anya,"(dismissively) Oh, no. (shakes her head)"
Willow,"(disappointed) Well, could we pretend it is?"
Anya,The necklace was a family heirloom passed down for generations.  Then it was stolen from my mom's apartment.
Willow,How does the spell work?
Anya,"(gets up) Uh, well, we both call on Eryishon, (kneels opposite  Willow) the Endless One, offer up the standard supplication, then  there's a teensy temporal fold. (smiles weakly) We hope. Um, then I pour  the sacred sand on the representation of the necklace, and Eryishon  brings it forth from the time and place it was lost."
Willow,(smiles) Cool.
Anya,Are we ready?
Willow,(slightly nervous) I think so.
Anya,Eryishon. K'shala. Meh-uhn.
Willow,Diprecht. Doh-tehenlo nu-Eryishon.
Anya,The child to the mother.
Willow,The river to the sea.
Anya,"(closes her eyes) Eryishon, hear my prayer."
Willow,That was... W-w-what was that? (slowly stands up)
Anya,"(feels for her necklace in the sands) Oh, it's not here. (pounds  the floor, frustrated) It's not here!"
Willow,"(composes herself) Okay, that's a little blacker than I like my  arts."
Anya,"(exasperated) Oh, don't be such a wimp."
Willow,"(very uneasy) That, that-that wasn't just some temporal fold,  that was some weird Hell place. I-I don't think you're telling me  everything."
Anya,"(tersely insistent) I swear, I am just trying to find my  necklace."
Willow,"(indignantly) Well, did you try looking inside the sofa *in  Hell*?"
Anya,"Look, (smiles sweetly) we'll just try it again, and..."
Willow,(steps back) No! I-I think emphatically not!
Anya,(angrily) I can't do it by myself!
Willow,(gathers her things) That's a relief. I'm outta here.
Anya,(furiously) Fine! Go! (mutters to herself) Idiot child.
Willow,"(reaches down, haughtily) I believe these chicken feet are  mine. Look, m-magic is dangerous, Anya, i-it's, it's not to be toyed  with. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have someone else's homework to do."
Anya,(anguished) Nothing! (smashes it)
Lyrics,<I>There's a chair in my head on which I used to sit / Took a  pencil and I wrote the following on it / Now there's a key where my  wonderful mouth / Used to be</I>
Lyrics,"<I>Dig it up, throw it at me / Dig it up, throw it at me</I>"
Lyrics,<I>Where can I run to / Where can I hide / Who will I turn to /  Now I'm in the virgin state of mind</I>
Lyrics,"<I>Got a knife to disengage the voids that I can't bear / Cut out  words I've got written on my chair / Like, do you think I'm sexy / And  do you think I really care</I>"
Percy,"Hey! (recognizes her, surprised, then amused) Rosenberg? What  are you doing, trick-or-treating? (points at her) You're supposed to be  at home doing my history report. I flunk that class, you're in big  trouble with Snyder. (smugly) Till we graduate, I own your ass."
Xander,What's going on? Is there a funny thing?
Xander,Back off! You stay the hell away from her!
Percy,(panicked) Okay! Sure! (scrambles away)
Xander,"(amazed) Will, changing the look not an idle threat with you."
Xander,"Uh... Will, this is verging on naughty touching here. (her  hands go further down) Don't wanna fall back on bad habits. (her hands  reach his butt) (jumps, surprised) Hands! Hands in new places!"
Xander,"(nods, eyeing her curiously) You mentioned that before. Will,  are you okay?"
Buffy,(finds them) Oh. There you are.
Xander,"(never looking away from Evil Willow) Hey, Buff."
Buffy,"Aren't you gonna introduce me to your... (recognizes) Holy  *God*, you're Willow."
Buffy,"(tries to be polite) You know what? (smiles supportively) I, I  like the look. (stammers) It's, um... it's, it's extreme, but it, it, it  looks good, you know, it's a (breathes deeply) leather thing, and, uh...  (to Xander) I said extreme already, right?"
Buffy,"(taken aback) Will, I'm sorry about today. You know how my foot  likes to live in my mouth. (puzzled) But you know... y-you really didn't  have to prove anything."
Xander,"Will, gotta say, not lovin' the new you."
Buffy,"(goes after her) Will, wait..."
Alfonse,Willow Rosenberg.
Alfonse,Then we won't talk.
Alfonse,(panting) There's been a mistake here. We were sent after a  human.
Alfonse,(hoarsely) I'm not telling you a thing.
Alfonse,(gives in) Wilkins. The Mayor.
Alfonse,(gets it) You.
Giles,"Oh, Buffy. I thought you were going out tonight. I didn't  expect..."
Giles,(very worried) What is it?
Xander,(takes a breath) This isn't real.
Buffy,"(numbly) I can't feel anything. Arms, legs, anything."
Giles,She was truly the finest of all of us.
Xander,Way better than me.
Giles,"(nods decisively) Much, much better."
Xander,It's all my fault.
Buffy,"(despairingly) No, it's me. I-it's me. I'm the one that called  her reliable. She must have gone out and gotten attacked, which she  never would have done if I hadn't have called her reliable. And now my  best friend is..."
Willow,(curiously) What's going on?
Willow,"Jeez, who died?"
Willow,"(almost panicked) Oh, God! Who died?"
Xander,"Back! Get back, demon!"
Buffy,"(breathlessly) Willow, you're alive?"
Willow,(puzzled) Aren't I usually?
Buffy,Oh!
Willow,"(wonderingly) I love you guys, too?"
Willow,Okay. Oxygen becoming an issue.
Willow,"Giles, what's going on with these..."
Willow,Oh!
Giles,Oh. Sorry. (backs away)
Willow,"(still wondering) It's really nice that you guys missed me.  (wide-eyed) Say, you all didn't happen to do a bunch of drugs, did ya?"
Xander,"(breathless) Will, we saw you at the Bronze. A vampire."
Willow,"(startled, then insulted) I'm not a *vampire*."
Buffy,"You are. (gets a look from Willow) I-I mean, you, you were.  (very confused) Giles, planning on jumping in with an explanation any  time soon?"
Giles,"(very unsure) Well, uh... something... something, um, very  strange is happening."
Xander,(facetiously) Can you believe the Watcher's Council let this  guy go?
Anya,(wearily) What a day. (to the bartender) Gimme a beer.
Bartender,(deadpan) I.D.
Bartender,I.D.
Anya,"(loses it, thumps her fists on the bar) I'm eleven hundred and  twenty years old! Just gimme a friggin' beer!"
Bartender,(unimpressed) I.D.
Anya,"(sighs, defeated) Gimme a Coke."
Devon,"Man, we need a roadie. (wistfully) Other bands have roadies."
Oz,"Well, other bands know more than three chords. Your professional  bands can play up to six, sometimes seven *completely* different chords."
Devon,"That's just, like, fruity jazz bands."
Angel,(finds them) Oz.
Oz,"Hey, man. You looking for Buffy?"
Angel,As always.
Oz,"Well, no sightings as of yet, but I think she said she'd show."
Oz,(quietly to Angel) That doesn't look good.
Alfonse,"(yells) EVERYBODY, SHUT UP!"
Alfonse,(to everyone) Alright. Nobody cause any trouble or try to  leave... and nobody gets hurt.
Angel,(quietly) Why don't I believe him?
Oz,"(quietly) Well, he lacks credibility."
Oz,Can you get outta here?
Angel,(eyes cast upward) Skylight in the roof. I can make it.
Oz,(worried) I think we need some backup.
Angel,(evenly) I think I'm needed here.
Oz,(raises his eyebrows) Ten to one. Could get pointless.
Oz,(in utter disbelief) Get Buffy. Do it now.
Devon,"(quietly, smiling) Dude, check out your girlfriend."
Sandy,Sandy.
Devon,"(to Oz) No, man!"
Oz,(shocked) Willow. You don't wanna do this.
Oz,(horrified) Who *did* this to you?
Anya,(unafraid) 'Cause he thinks you're someone else. He thinks you're  the Willow that belongs in *this* reality.
Anya,"You know this isn't your world, right? I mean, you know you don't  belong here."
Anya,(states the obvious) You wanna get back there.
Anya,So do I.
Willow,This is creepy. I don't like the thought that there's a vampire  out there that looks like me.
Xander,Not looks like. Is.
Buffy,"It was exactly you, Will, every detail. Except for your not  being a dominatrix. (uneasily) As far as we know."
Willow,"(rolls her eyes, grins sardonically) Oh, right. Me and Oz play  'Mistress of Pain' every night."
Xander,Did anyone else just go to a scary visual place?
Buffy,"Oh, yeah."
Angel,"(very upset) Buffy, I... I just... Something's happened that..."
Angel,(blurts it out) Willow's dead.
Angel,"(distractedly) Hey, Willow."
Angel,(very confused) Wait a second.
Xander,"(understandingly) We're *right* there with you, buddy."
Buffy,"We saw her, too, at the Bronze."
Angel,(still somewhat unsure) Okay. She's there now with a cadre of  vampires looking to party.
Buffy,(resignedly) We can figure out who she is *after* we stop the  feeding frenzy.
Buffy,How many of them were there?
Angel,Eight or ten.
Buffy,(to Giles) Should we call Faith?
Giles,"No, I don't want her in combat yet. Not around civilians."
Xander,"(heartily) Hear, hear."
Willow,(holds back) Guys? (they stop and look back) What are we gonna  do with me? The... other... me?
Buffy,"(comes closer to Willow) I don't know, Will. (hesitates) I mean,  we just have to stop them."
Willow,"I-I get that. I just kind of wanted to know... (thinks of  something) Oh! Hey, uh, go. I-I'll catch up."
Willow,What do I want with you? (catches herself) Uh...
Willow,Oh. (gets it) Oh! Oops!
Willow,(uncertainly) Would that mean we have to snuggle?
Willow,(completely unnerved) This just can't get more disturbing.
Willow,(flapping her hands with disgust) Ack! Ew! No more! You're  really starting to freak me out!
Willow,Ow!
Giles,(dumbfounded) It's extraordinary.
Willow,"(appalled) It's horrible! That's me as a vampire? (Angel closes  the door) I'm so evil and... skanky. (aside to Buffy, worried) And I  think I'm kinda gay."
Buffy,"(reassuringly) Willow, just remember, a vampire's personality  has nothing to do with the person it was."
Angel,"(without thinking) Well, actually... (gets a look from Buffy)  That's a good point."
Xander,"So, uh, what do we do now?"
Giles,We still have to get to the Bronze.
Angel,"Well, even if they're supposed to wait for her they may start  feeding. Vampires are not notoriously reliable."
Xander,"(hopefully) So we charge in, much in the style of John Wayne?"
Giles,"High casualty risk. I haven't any other plan, though."
Buffy,"(raises her hand) Uh, I have a really bad idea."
Angel,They're still in a holding pattern. That's good. It means they  must really be afraid of you.
Willow,Who wouldn't be?
Buffy,Are you okay in that?
Willow,"It's a little binding. I guess vampires really don't have to  breathe. (notices her cleavage) Gosh, look at those."
Giles,"(stammers) Um, ahem, Willow, you, uh, you go in and defuse the  situation as best you can. At least try and get some of them to come out  and even up the odds a bit."
Buffy,"First sign of trouble, you give us a signal. We come in hard and  fast."
Xander,What *is* the signal?
Willow,(worried) Me screaming.
Angel,"Giles, you and Xander wait by the back entrance."
Giles,Good.
Buffy,"Now, you're sure you're up to this?"
Willow,Don't worry. I won't do anything that could be interpreted as  brave. (smiles)
Buffy,We'll be right outside.
Willow,Hi. I'm back.
Alfonse,Did you find the girl?
Willow,(tries to sound authoritative) Yep. I did.
Anya,(mystified) Where is she?
Willow,(bravely) I killed her.
Willow,"And sucked her blood, (nods triumphantly) as we vampires do."
Willow,"(quietly aside to him) You know, I think maybe I heard  something out there. Why don't you go check?"
Anya,(incredulous) H-how could you kill her? She was our best shot at  getting your world back.
Willow,"(walks past her, straightens challengingly) I don't like that  you dare question me."
Willow,(now enjoying herself) Maybe I'll have my minions take you out  back and kill you horribly.
Anya,(muttering) Vampires. Always thinking with your teeth.
Willow,"(haughtily) She bothered me. She's so weak and accommodating.  She's always letting people walk all over her, (turns to face her) and  then she gets cranky with her friends for no reason. I just *couldn't*  let her live."
Willow,"(chummily) You know, he's been gone for a while. Why don't you  go check on him? (pats his shoulder approvingly)"
Alfonse,"(impatiently) Well, Boss, since that plan is out, why don't we  get with the killing?"
Cordelia,Hello? Giles?
Cordelia,(casually) Wesley? I just happened to stop by... for books.
Cordelia,"(faces her) 'Hey me'? (insulted) 'Hey me' what? I have a  name, you know."
Cordelia,(steps over) What did you do? Lock yourself in the book cage?
Cordelia,Okay.
Cordelia,"I think Giles keeps a spare. How'd you manage to lock  yourself in, anyway?"
Cordelia,"(sarcastically) Yeah, right. The famous shy girl act all the  boys fall for."
Cordelia,"Wait. (briskly) It occurs to me that we've never really had  the opportunity to talk. You know, woman to woman... with you locked up."
Cordelia,(pretends to think) What could we talk about? Oh! Hey! How  about the ethics of boyfriend stealing?
Willow,I don't know if I feel like killing anymore.
Willow,I'm so bored.
Willow,I-it would be like shooting fish in a barrel. Where's the fun?
Alfonse,"(smiles grimly) With all due respect, Boss, the fun would be  the eating."
Willow,"(brilliantly) Maybe we should let everyone go, and give them a  thirty second head start."
Anya,(finally figures it out) Wait a minute.
Willow,(frowns fretfully) No! I *like* my plan.
Anya,"(snickers) Oh, nice try."
Willow,"(desperately) Okay, let's get to the killing. (hurriedly to  Alfonse) Why don't we start with her?"
Anya,"Why don't we start with you? (to Alfonse, in disgust) If she's a  vampire, then I'm the creature from the black lagoon."
Cordelia,"(rationalizing) And, okay, it isn't even like I was that  attracted to Xander. It was more just that we kept being put in these  life or death situations, and that's always all sexy and stuff."
Cordelia,"(gets up) I mean, I more or less knew he was a loser. (sets  down the mug) (huffily) But that doesn't make it okay for you to come  around and... (notices Evil Willow's stare) What? Do I have something on  my neck?"
Cordelia,(worried) Am I getting a zit? (checks her skin)
Cordelia,"(stung) Like you could! I should just leave you in there, but  I'm a great humanitarian, (gets the keys) and you will just have to  think of a way to pay me back sometime."
Cordelia,(desperately) I didn't mean all that stuff I said before. I  want you to have Xander. My blessings on you both!
Wesley,(commandingly) Back! Creature of the night!
Wesley,(warningly) Leave this place!
Cordelia,(whines apologetically) I'm sorry.
Wesley,"(puts the water away) No, no. (breathes deeply) A little on  edge. (bravely) You know, men in combat. (makes a tough face) Grr.  (concerned) Are you all right?"
Cordelia,(awed) You saved my life. Thank you!
Wesley,"(awkwardly) Oh, yes. Uh... Yes."
Wesley,(stunned) Was that...?
Cordelia,"Willow. (shakes her head sorrowfully) They got Willow. (gets  over it) (brightly) So, are you doing anything tonight?"
Anya,(dispirited) I'm just so tired of being around human beings and  all their baggage. I-I don't care if I ever get my powers back.
Anya,(crosses her arms) I think he (meaning Alfonse) should eat you.
Willow,(improvises quickly) This girl has a history of mental problems  dating back to early childhood. (desperately) I'm a blood-sucking fiend!  (pats herself) Look at my outfit!
Alfonse,(shakes his head in shame) A human. I should have smelled it  right away.
Willow,"A human? Oh, yeah? Could a human do this?"
Anya,Sure. Yeah. Humans do that. Yeah. (shrugs)
Alfonse,"(concurring) Yeah. Yeah, I think, yeah."
Willow,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Happy, but ow!"
Oz,"Devon, come on!"
Willow,(frightened) No more snuggles?
Willow,"(urgently) BUFFY, NO!"
Willow,(admiringly) Nice reflexes.
Buffy,"(shrugs gracefully) Well, I work out."
Willow,"(surprised, empathetically) You noticed that, too?"
Xander,"So, um, in your reality, I'm like this bad-ass vampire, huh?  People afraid of me?"
Xander,"(steps away, chortling gleefully) Oh, yeah. I'm bad."
Buffy,"(uncertainly) I'm not sure about releasing this thing into the  wild, Will. It is a demon."
Willow,(penitently) I just can't kill her.
Buffy,"(regretfully) No. Me, neither."
Willow,"(hesitantly) I mean, I know she's not me. We have a big nothing  in common, but... still."
Buffy,(understandingly) There but for the grace of getting bit.
Willow,"(resolutely) We send her back to her world, and she stands a  chance. It's the way it should be anyway."
Giles,"Uh, we're about ready here."
Giles,"(to Anya, warningly) Don't you try any tricks now, dear."
Anya,"(sulkily) I don't need tricks. (arrogantly contemptuous) When I  get my powers back, you will all grovel before me."
Giles,"(unimpressed) Yes, uh, if you, uh, Willows, would like to, uh,  (gestures where they should kneel) complete the circle."
Willow,Good luck. (helpfully) Try not to kill people.
Willow,(shocked) Hands! Hands!
Buffy,You wanna go out tonight?
Willow,"Strangely, I feel like staying at home... (sadly) and doing my  homework... and flossing... and dying a virgin."
Buffy,"(sagely) You know, you can O.D. on virtue."
Willow,"Between me and my evil self, I've got double guilt coupons. I  see now where the path of vice leads. I mean, she messed up everything  she touched. I don't ever want to be like that."
Percy,"(comes up to them, a bit nervous) Hey. Uh, hi."
Willow,"Oh, hi. Listen, I didn't have a chance..."
Percy,"(interrupts) Okay, so I did the outline for the paper on  Roosevelt. (hands it to her) It turns out there were two President  Roosevelts, so I didn't know exactly which one to do, so I did both."
Percy,"(respectfully) Um, and I know they're kinda, kinda short, but I  can flesh them out. Oh, and here's the bibliography. (hands it to her)  Um, and I can retype that if you want. You just let me know what I did  wrong, and I'll get on it."
Buffy,(innocently) You wanna go out tonight?
Willow,(hopefully) 9:00 sound good? </PRE> <P> </TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER>
