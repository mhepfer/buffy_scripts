Forrest,"""Well you can't"""
Riley,"""Yeah, I know I can't, but it bugs me this time."""
Forrest,"""This is the burden we bear, brother. We have a gig that would inevitably cause any girl living to think we are cool upon cool. Yet we must Clark Kent our way through the dating scene never to use our unfair advantage."""
Forrest,"""Thank God we're pretty."""
Riley,"""But its just... Buffy's special"""
Forrest,"""You think she's special. Wow.  The first 486 times you told me it didn't register but now I 'see' that you think she's special."""

Forrest,"""{{Then get with the kissing}}"""
Riley,"""Riley Finn"""
