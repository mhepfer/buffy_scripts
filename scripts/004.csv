Xander,May I cut in?
Xander,You alright?
Buffy,(exhales) Thanks to you!
Buffy,You hurt your hand! Will you still be able to...
Xander,...finish my solo and kiss you like you've never been kissed  before?
Buffy,You're drooling.
Buffy,Xander!
Buffy,You've got a little...
Buffy,(on the spot) Ways that ants communicate.
Buffy,With other ants.
Buffy,"(sees Willow's signals) Um, uh, uh..."
Buffy,Touch...
Buffy,"And, um..."
Buffy,(confused) B.O.?
Blayne,Thank God someone finally found the courage to mention that!
Buffy,"Well, what teenager doesn't?"
Buffy,"Well, that fire, I mean, there was major extenuating  circumstances. Actually, it's, uh, kinda funny!"
Buffy,Destructo Girl. That's me.
Buffy,"You mean, 'great' in a bad way?"
Buffy,...the homework thing.
Buffy,Yeah! Sorry.
Buffy,Okay! Thanks.
Lyrics,"<I>The first date's the worst date / It's hard to know just what  to do / And I take you to dinner / You don't eat, you just play with  your food</I>"
Lyrics,<I>And there's something familiar...</I>
Lyrics,<I>About every word you say</I>
Lyrics,"<I>It's hard to believe it's happened again / I already met you /  And I already met you / You're like my last girlfriend / Yes, and the  girlfriend I had before her</I>"
Blayne,"Seven, including Cheryl. I'll tell you, though, her sister was  lookin' to make it eight!"
Boy,"Ooo, Cheryl's sister? The one in college?"
Blayne,"(nods) Home for the holidays and lookin' for love! She's not my  type, though. Girls really gotta have something to go with me."
Xander,(interrupting) Something like a lobotomy?
Blayne,Xander. How many times you score?
Xander,"Well, uh..."
Blayne,It's just a question.
Xander,"Are we talking today, or the whole week?"
Xander,Ooo! Duty calls!
Xander,Babes!
Buffy,What are you doing?
Xander,(to Buffy) Work with me here. Blayne had the nerve to question  my manliness. I'm just gonna give him a visual.
Willow,(throws her arms around him tightly) We'll show him!
Buffy,(distracted) I don't believe it.
Xander,"I know, and after all my conquests."
Xander,Who's that?
Willow,That must be Angel! I think?
Xander,That weird guy that warned her about all the vampires?
Willow,"That's him, I'll bet you."
Xander,"Well, he's buff! She never said anything about him being buff!"
Willow,You think he's buff?
Xander,He's a very attractive man! How come *that* never came up?
Buffy,Well! Look who's here!
Angel,Hi.
Buffy,"I'd say it's nice to see you, but then we both know that's a big  fib."
Angel,I won't be long.
Buffy,"No, you'll just give me a cryptic warning about some exciting  new catastrophe, and then disappear into the night. Right?"
Angel,You're cold.
Buffy,You can take it.
Angel,"(takes off his jacket) I mean, you look cold."
Xander,"Oh, right! Give her your jacket. It's a balmy night, no one  needs to be trading clothing out there!"
Buffy,A little big on me. (notices a series of cuts on Angel's arm)  What happened?
Angel,I didn't pay attention.
Buffy,To somebody with a big fork?
Angel,He's coming.
Buffy,The Fork Guy?
Angel,Don't let him corner you. Don't give him a moment's mercy. He'll  rip your throat out.
Buffy,"Okay, I'll give you improved marks for that one. Ripping a  throat out, it's a strong visual, it's not cryptic!"
Angel,I have to go. (leaves)
Buffy,"(stares after him) Sweet dreams to you, too."
Giles,That's all he said? Fork Guy?
Buffy,That's all Cryptic Guy said: Fork Guy.
Giles,I think there are too many 'guys' in your life. (laughs)
Giles,"I'll see what I can find out. (looks up at the sky) God, every  day here is the same."
Buffy,"Bright, sunny, beautiful, how ever can we escape this torment?"
Giles,Really.
Giles,Good morning.
Xander,"Mornin'. (to the girls) Guess what I just heard in the office?  No Dr. Gregory today. Ergo, those of us who blew off our science  homework aren't as dumb as we look."
Buffy,"What happened, is he sick?"
Xander,"They didn't say anything about sick, something about missing."
Buffy,He's missing?
Xander,"Well, let me think. Um, the cheerleaders were modeling their  new short skirts, that kinda got... Yeah! Yeah, they said missing."
Xander,Which is bad?
Buffy,"If something's wrong, yeah!"
Willow,He's one of the only teachers that doesn't think Buffy's a  felon.
Xander,"I'm really sorry, I'm sure he'll..."
Xander,"I, uh, huh..."
Xander,"Uh, huh... huh..."
Natalie,Could you help me?
Xander,Uuuuuuhhhhhh... Yes!
Natalie,I'm looking for Science... 109.
Xander,"Oh! It's, um..."
Xander,(smiles) I go there every day!
Xander,"(looks to the girls for help) Oh, God, where is it?"
Blayne,Hi! Blayne Mall. I'm going there right now. It's not far from  the varsity field where I took All-City last year. (smiles smugly)
Natalie,"Oh! Thank you, Blayne!"
Xander,It's funny how the Earth never opens up and swallows you when  you want it to.
Willow,What's wrong?
Buffy,Dr. Gregory dropped his glasses... Why wouldn't he pick them up?
Natalie,"My name is Natalie French, and I will be substituting for Dr.  Gregory."
Buffy,Do you know when he's coming back?
Natalie,"No, I don't, um, (checks her roster) Buffy. They just call and  tell me where they want me."
Blayne,(in a low voice) I'll tell you where I want you.
Natalie,"Excuse me, Blayne?"
Blayne,"Uh, I was just wondering if you were gonna pick up where Dr.  Gregory left off."
Natalie,(smiles) Yes. His notes tell me you were right in the middle  of insect life.
Natalie,The praying mantis is a fascinating creature. Forced to live  alone. Who can tell me why? Buffy?
Buffy,"Well, the words 'bug-ugly' kinda spring to mind."
Natalie,There is nothing ugly about these unique creatures. The reason  they live alone is because they're cannibals!
Buffy,Eww!
Natalie,"Oh, well, it's hardly their fault! It's the way nature  designed them: noble, solitary and prolific. Over 1800 species  worldwide, and in nearly all of them the female is larger *and* more  aggressive than the male."
Blayne,(aside to Buffy) Nothing wrong with an aggressive female.
Natalie,"The California Mantis lays her eggs, and then finds a mate..."
Natalie,"...to fertilize them. Once he's played his part, she covers  the eggs in a protective sack and attaches it to a leaf or twig out of  danger. Now, if she's done her job correctly, in a few months she'll  have several hundred offspring."
Natalie,"You know, we should make some model egg sacks for the science  fair. Who would like to help me do that after school?"
Natalie,(pleased) Good!
Buffy,"Hot dog surprise. Be still, my heart."
Willow,"Call me old-fashioned, I don't want any more surprises in my  hot dogs."
Xander,I wonder what she sees in me? It's probably the quiet good  looks coupled with a certain smoky magnetism.
Xander,Miss French. You two're probably a little young to understand  what an older woman would see in a younger man.
Buffy,"Oh, I understand."
Xander,Good!
Buffy,"The younger man is too dumb to wonder why an older woman can't  find someone her own age, and too desperate to care about the surgical  improvements!"
Xander,(taken aback) What surgical improvements?
Willow,"(to Buffy) Well, he is young."
Buffy,And so terribly innocent!
Xander,"Hey, those that can, do. Those that can't *laugh* at those  who... can do."
Blayne,"Gotta carb up for my one-on-one with Miss French today. When's  yours? Oh, right, tomorrow. You came in second, I came in first. Guess  that's what they call natural selection. (leaves)"
Xander,Guess it's what they call a rehearsal! (to the girls)  Rehearsal... (laughs lamely)
Cordelia,(to Buffy) Excuse you!
Cordelia,Medically prescribed lunch. My doctor ships it daily... I'll  only be here as long as I can hold my breath.
Cordelia,"(hysterically) His head! His head! Oh, my God, where's his  head?!"
Giles,(hands the glass to Buffy) Here. Drink this.
Buffy,"(idly takes the glass) No, thank you. (takes a sip)"
Xander,(behind Giles) I've never seen...
Xander,"(shaken) I mean, I've never seen anything like... That was new."
Willow,Who would wanna hurt Dr. Gregory?
Giles,"Uh, he didn't have any enemies on the staff that I'm aware of.  He was a civilized man. I liked him."
Buffy,So did I.
Willow,"(looks up at Giles) Well, we're gonna find out who did this.  We'll find them and we'll stop them."
Buffy,Count on it.
Giles,What do we know?
Buffy,"Oh, not a lot, um... (sniffs and wipes a tear from her nose) He  was killed here on campus. I'm guessing the last day we saw him."
Giles,How do you work that out?
Buffy,He didn't change his clothing.
Xander,"This is a question that no one particularly wants to hear,  but... where did they put his head?"
Willow,Good point. I *didn't* wanna hear that.
Buffy,Angel! (gets up) He warned me that something was coming.
Giles,"Yes. Yes he did, didn't he? I wish I knew what he meant. I've  been trying to gather more information about the Master, our, uh, local  vampire king. There was one oblique reference to a, a, a vampire who  displeased the Master and cut his hand off in penance."
Buffy,Cut off his hand and replaced it with a fork?
Giles,I don't know what he replaced it with.
Xander,"So, why would he come after a teacher?"
Giles,I'm not certain he did. There was an incident two nights ago...
Giles,"...uh, involving a homeless person in Weatherly Park. He was  practically shredded, but, uh, nothing like Dr. Gregory."
Buffy,(looks at the paper) Fork Guy doesn't do heads.
Giles,Not historically.
Buffy,And Dr. Gregory's blood wasn't drained.
Xander,"So there's something else out there? Besides Silverwareman? Oh,  this is fun, we're on Monster Island."
Buffy,We're on a Hellmouth. It's a center of mystical convergence.  Guess it's the same thing. (walks toward Xander)
Giles,"Well, unpleasant things do gravitate here, it's true, but, uh,  we don't know there's anything besides this chap. He's still our likely  suspect."
Buffy,Where was that guy killed? Weatherly Park?
Giles,"Buffy. (advances toward her) I know you're upset, but, uh, this  is no time to go hunting, not until we know more. Please promise me you  won't do anything rash?"
Buffy,Cross my heart.
Bum,"Shouldn't be out here at night, little lady. Dangerous."
Voices,Hold it! Police! Did you see that? I got nothing here!
Voices,"I heard it. Spread out. Let's go over here. This way, this way.  Alright..."
Giles,You went hunting last night.
Buffy,Yes.
Giles,When you assured me you wouldn't. (takes a sip from his mug)
Buffy,"Yes, I lied, I'm a bad person, let's move on."
Giles,(opens his file cabinet) Did you see someone with a fork?
Buffy,More like a jumbo claw.
Giles,"(turns to face her) Oh. Well, uh, at least you're not hurt."
Buffy,And I saw something else. Something much more interesting than  your average run-of-the-mill killer vampire.
Giles,Oh?
Buffy,"Do you know Miss French, the teacher that's subbing for Dr.  Gregory?"
Giles,"(smiles) Yes. Yes, she's lovely. In a, a common, extremely well  proportioned way. (puts some files away)"
Buffy,"Well, I'm chasing Claw Guy last night, and Miss Well  Proportioned is heading home. The Claw Guy takes one look at her and  runs screaming for cover."
Giles,(confused) He what? Ran away?
Buffy,He was petrified.
Giles,Of Miss French?
Buffy,Uh-huh! So I'm an undead monster that can shave with my hand...  How many things am I afraid of?
Giles,"Not many. And not substitute teachers, as a rule."
Buffy,So what's her deal?
Giles,I think perhaps it would be a good idea if we kept an eye on  her.
Buffy,Then I better get to class.
Buffy,"Um, you mean yesterday in the cafeteria when we found him..."
Buffy,"(stops him short) Well, no, I'm gonna be late for biology..."
Buffy,But I really don't need...
Buffy,"But, I really, really don't..."
Buffy,"But Mr. Flutie, I..."
Cordelia,"I don't know what to say, it was really, I mean, one minute  you're in your normal life, and then who's in the fridge? (the camera  pans over to show her inside) It really gets to you, a thing like that.  (cut inside) It was... let's just say I haven't been able to eat a thing  since yesterday. I think I lost, like, seven and a half ounces? Way  swifter than that so-called diet that quack put me on. Oh, I'm not  saying that we should kill a teacher every day just so I can lose  weight, I'm just saying when tragedy strikes, we have to look on the  bright side. You know?"
Cordelia,"Like, how even used Mercedes still have leather seats!"
Natalie,Keep your eyes straight ahead on your own test.
Natalie,(in a low voice) I think you meant 'pollination' for number  fourteen. (puts her hand on his shoulder) I'll see you here after  school.
Buffy,"Oh, great, a pop quiz."
Buffy,"No, I'm not saying she craned her neck. We are talking full-on  Exorcist twist."
Willow,Ouch!
Buffy,"Which reminds me, how come Blayne, who worked with her one-on- one yesterday, isn't here today?"
Willow,Inquiring minds wanna know.
Buffy,(to Giles) Any luck?
Giles,"Um, I've not found any creature as yet that strikes terror in a  vampire's heart."
Buffy,Try looking under things that can turn their heads all the way  around.
Giles,Nothing human can do that.
Buffy,"No, nothing human. There are some insects that can. Whatever she  is, I'm gonna be ready for her."
Giles,What are you going to do?
Buffy,(turns back to answer) My homework.
Buffy,Where are the books on bugs?
Xander,Hi!
Natalie,"Oh, Hi! I was just grabbing a snack. Can I fix you something?"
Xander,"No thanks, I never... eat when I'm making egg sacks. (sees the  model) Wow, if this were real the bugs would be..."
Natalie,...as big as you!
Xander,Yeah! So! Where do we start?
Natalie,"Oh, Xander! (gets up) I've done something really stupid. I  hope you can forgive me."
Xander,"Oh, forgiveness is my middle name! Well, actually it's LaVelle,  and I'd appreciate it if you guard that secret with your life. (laughs)"
Natalie,"(laughs) I have a teacher's conference in half an hour, and I  left the paint and papier-mâché at home. I don't suppose you'd like to  come to my place tonight to work on it there?"
Xander,"(swallows) Come to, uh... your place?"
Natalie,7:30? Here's my address. (writes it down)
Natalie,(hands him her address) I'll see you tonight?
Xander,"(in a high, squeaky voice) Yeah!"
Xander,"(pumping his fists into the air) Ooo, yes!"
Buffy,"Dig this: 'The praying mantis can rotate its head 180 degrees  while waiting for its next meal to walk by.' (slams the book shut) Ha!  (silence) Well, c'mon, guys. Ha!"
Willow,"Well, Miss French is sort of big. For a bug?"
Giles,"And she is, by and large, woman shaped."
Buffy,(makes her way down to them) Okay. Factoid 1: Only the praying  mantis can rotate its head like that. Factoid 2: A pretty whacked-out  vampire is scared to death of her. Factoid 3: Her fashion sense screams  predator.
Willow,It's the shoulder pads.
Buffy,Exactly.
Giles,"If you're right, then she'd have to be a shape shifter or a  perception distorter. On a helpful note, I had a chum at Oxford,  Carlyle, advanced degrees in entomology mythology."
Buffy,Entoma-who?
Giles,Bugs and fairy tales.
Buffy,I knew that.
Giles,"If I recall correctly, poor old Carlyle, just before he went  mad, claimed there was some beast..."
Willow,"(the PC beeps) Buffy, 911! Blayne's mom called the school. He  never came home last night."
Giles,The boy who worked with Miss French yesterday?
Willow,Yeah! If Miss French is responsible for... Xander's supposed to  be helping her right now! He's got a crush on a giant insect!
Buffy,"Okay, don't panic, I'll warn him. But I need you to hack onto  the coroner's office for me."
Willow,"Well, what are we looking for?"
Buffy,"Autopsy on Dr. Gregory. I've been trying to figures out these  marks that I saw on his corpse... I'm thinking they were teeth. And, uh,  these cuddlies? (points to a picture of a mantis) Should definitely be  brushing after every meal. (Willow types) (to Giles) And you were saying  something about a beast?"
Giles,"(gets up to go to his office) Oh, uh, yeah, I just need to make  one transatlantic telephone call. (stops and turns back) Um, this  computer invasion that Willow's performing on the coroner's office, one,  one assumes it is entirely legal?"
Willow,Entirely!
Buffy,Of course!
Giles,"Right. Wasn't here, didn't see it, couldn't have stopped you."
Buffy,Good idea.
Buffy,Hey!
Xander,Hey!
Buffy,"So, how'd it go with Miss French?"
Xander,"Well, it's a bit demanding being her absolute favorite guy in  the universe, but I'll muddle through."
Buffy,"Xander, she's not what she seems."
Xander,"I know, she's so much more."
Buffy,"Okay, um... I'm gonna have to tell you something about her, and  I'm gonna need you to really listen, okay?"
Xander,Okay.
Buffy,I don't think she's human.
Xander,I see. So if she's not human she's...?
Buffy,Technically? A big bug.
Buffy,"This sounds really weird, I'm aware of that..."
Xander,"It doesn't sound weird at all, I completely understand. I've  met someone, and you're jealous."
Buffy,What?
Xander,"Look, there's nothing I can do about it. Uh, there's just this  certain chemical thing between Miss French and me."
Buffy,"I know, I read all about it, it's call, um, a pheromone. It's a  chemical attractant that insects give off."
Xander,"She's not an insect! She's a woman, okay? And hard as that may  be for you to conceive, an actual woman finds me attractive. I realize  it's no mystery guy handing out leather jackets, and while we're on the  subject, what kind of a girlie name is 'Angel' anyway?"
Buffy,What does that have to do with...
Xander,"Nothing! It just kinda bugs me. Look, I really gotta..."
Buffy,Wha...?
Natalie,Hi! Come on in!
Natalie,"Should I change? Is, is this too... (she closes the door)"
Xander,"No, no, it's, the most beautiful chest... dress I've ever seen."
Natalie,"Thank you. That's sweet. Martini? (offers him one) Oh, I'm  sorry, would you like something else?"
Natalie,"(laughs) I just need to relax a little, I'm kinda nervous  around you. (she sits down) You're probably cool as a cucumber!"
Xander,"(sits down) I like cucumbers. Like in that Greek salad thing  with the yogurt. Do you like Greek food? I'm exempting Schwarma, of  course, I mean, what's that all about? It's a big meat hive."
Xander,Hhhhhhho! Hello!
Natalie,Cheers! (clinks their glasses) Can I ask you a personal  question?
Natalie,Have you ever been with a woman before?
Xander,"You mean, like, in, uh, the same room?"
Natalie,You know what I mean.
Xander,"Oh, that, uh... Well, let me think. Um..."
Xander,"Yeah, there was, uh... several!"
Xander,"I mean, and, uh, quite a few times... And then there was, uh...  Oh, she was incredibly... No. Uh-uh."
Natalie,I know. I can tell.
Xander,You can?
Natalie,"Oh, I like it. You might say, I... *need* it."
Xander,"Oh! Well, needs should, uh, y'know... Needs should definitely  be met, as long as it doesn't require ointments the next day, or..."
Xander,Do you hear...
Natalie,No...
Xander,Sounds like someone crying...
Natalie,I don't hear anything. (takes his hand) Your hands are so hot!
Buffy,"Oh, you hurt your hand!"
Xander,"Buffy. I love Buffy. Wow! So that's a martini, huh?"
Natalie,Mm-hmm.
Xander,(sits back up) Do you hear...
Natalie,(interrupting) Would you like to touch me with those hands?
Xander,"(looks at Natalie's hands) Your hands are sss... really... (her  hands morph) serrated! Oh, wow, that martini, I... I really think I have  to..."
Xander,Miss... French?
Natalie,"Please, call me Natalie."
Giles,"Frankly, madam, I haven't the faintest idea what time it is, nor  do I care. Now, unlock his cell, unstrap him, and bring him to the  telephone immediately. This is a matter of life and death!"
Willow,"Got it! Coroner's report, complete with... Yuk! ...color  pictures."
Buffy,There *are* teeth marks. Which match perfectly the one insect  that nips off its prey's head.
Willow,"Okay, I-I don't like this."
Buffy,"Huh! It's the way they feed, head first. It's also the way they  mate. The female bites off the male's head while they're..."
Willow,"No, no, no! See? Xander's, I like his head! I-it's where you  find his eyes, and his hair, and his adorable smile..."
Buffy,"Hey, hey, take it easy, Willow. Xander is not in any immediate  danger. I saw him leave school. He's probably safe at home right now."
Xander,Ah! Blayne!
Blayne,"(terrified) Oh, God! Oh, God!"
Xander,Are you all right?
Blayne,"Oh, God! (breathes) You gotta get me outta here! You gotta!  She, she, she gets you, and, uh..."
Xander,What?
Blayne,"...she, she..."
Xander,What does she do?
Blayne,"Oh, God! Oh, oh, no!"
Xander,Blayne! What does she do?
Blayne,"She, she... she, she takes you outta the cage, and she ties you  up, and, and... she... she starts movin', and throbbin', and these eggs  come shootin' out of her! And then..."
Xander,What?
Blayne,And then...
Xander,Then what?
Blayne,She mates with you!
Xander,Sheeee...
Blayne,That's not the worst part!
Xander,That's not?
Blayne,"You seen her teeth? Right while she's, you know, right in the  middle of... I saw her do it! I don't wanna die like that!"
Xander,Blayne! Blayne! Chill! It's okay. It's gonna be okay. We'll get  outta this.
Blayne,(hopeful) You gotta plan? What is it?
Xander,"Just, uh, let me perfect it!"
Blayne,"(gives up hope) Oh, God... Oh, God... Oh, God..."
Giles,"I-I understand, Carlyle. Yes... I-I'll take every precaution.  Uh, absolutely, i-i-it sounds exactly like the creature you described.  Y-you were right all along about everything. Well, n-no, you weren't  right about your mother coming back as a Pekinese, but... uh... Try to  rest, old man. Yes... Ta! Bye now!"
Giles,Dr. Ferris Carlyle spent years transcribing a lost pre-Germanic  language. What he discovered he kept to himself until several teenage  boys were murdered in the Cotswolds. Then he went hunting for it.
Buffy,It being...
Giles,"Uh, he calls her a She-Mantis. This type of creature, the  Kleptes-Virgo, or, or virgin-thief, appears in, in many cultures. The  Greek sirens, the Celtic sea maidens, who, who tore the living flesh  from the bones of, um..."
Buffy,"Giles, while we're young!"
Giles,"Uh, well, basically the, uh, the She-Mantis assumes the form of  a beautiful woman and then lures innocent virgins back to her nest."
Buffy,"Virgins? Well, Xander's not a, uh... I mean, he's probably..."
Willow,"(quickly gets up, worried) ...gonna die! (goes to the phone)"
Buffy,"Okay, okay, (walks around Giles) so this thing is breeding and  we need to find it and snuff it. (faces Giles) Any tips on the snuffing  part?"
Giles,"Uh, Carlyle recommends cleaving all body parts with a sharp  blade."
Buffy,Slice and Dice.
Giles,"Well, whatever you do, it had better be certain and swift. This  beast is extremely dangerous."
Buffy,"Well, your buddy Carlyle faced it, and he's still around."
Giles,"Yes, in a straitjacket, howling his innards out day and night."
Buffy,"Okay, Admiral, way to inspire the troops!"
Giles,Sorry...
Willow,(off the phone now) Xander's not home! He told his mom he was  going to his teacher's house to work on a science project. He didn't  tell her where.
Buffy,"(to Willow) See if you can get her address off the substitute  rolls. (to Giles) And you need to record bat sonar, and fast!"
Giles,"Bat sonar, right. What?"
Buffy,"Bats eat them. (leads Giles to the stairs) The mantis hears  sonar, its entire nervous system goes kaplooey."
Giles,Where am I gonna find the...
Buffy,"In the vid library? There're no books, but it's dark and musty,  you'll feel right at home, go! (exhales) (to herself) I guess I'll  handle the armory."
Blayne,Don't do anything to make her mad!
Blayne,"(brightens) Hey, alright, now I can get outta my cage! (bummed)  Into yours. What'd you do that for?"
Xander,A weapon!
Blayne,(sees Natalie coming) I think you're gonna need it.
Willow,Getting the address.
Buffy,Great! Giles?
Giles,(holding a tape recorder) Recording bat sonar is something  soothingly akin to having one's teeth drilled.
Buffy,(takes the tape recorder) Let's roll!
Willow,"According to Miss French's personnel records, she was born in  1907. She's, like, 90 years old!"
Giles,And extremely well preserved!
Blayne,"Oh, God! (goes through the hole into Xander's cage) Uh, he did  that, he broke the cage, take him, not me, take him!"
Giles,"What now, exactly? We can't just kick the door down."
Buffy,"Yeah, that *would* be wrong."
Buffy,I'm looking for Miss French.
Buffy,"Natalie French, the substitute biology teacher?"
Buffy,(to Giles) I can't believe this! She used Miss French's records  to get into the school. She could be anywhere!
Xander,What's she doing?
Blayne,"I think it's eeny, meeny, miney..."
Xander,Moe?
Xander,"I'm comin', I'm comin'."
Willow,What do we do now?
Giles,Abject prayer and supplication would spring to mind.
Buffy,I saw her walking past this park with her grocery bags. She  lives in this neighborhood.
Willow,I'm gonna start banging on doors. (heads for the next house)
Buffy,"(stops Willow) Wait, no, we do *not* have time for that!"
Willow,We have to do something!
Buffy,We will.
Buffy,I won't be long. (goes down)
Giles,W... Buffy?
Blayne,"Oh, yeah, here it comes!"
Xander,What? What's happening?!
Blayne,"How do you like your eggs, bro, over easy or sunny side up?"
Xander,Eggs? She's gonna lay some...
Natalie,"The California Mantis lays her eggs, and then finds a mate to  fertilize them."
Willow,"(into the hole) Come on, Buffy!"
Buffy,Me!
Buffy,"Come on! Come on, where is she? Which house is it? I know you're  afraid of her, I saw you! Come on!"
Buffy,"Come on. What? What is it? This is her, isn't it, this is her  house? This is it! Better than radar!"
Willow,Buffy!
Natalie,Kiss me! (laughs) Kiss me!
Xander,Can I just say one thing? HEEEELLLLP! HEEEELLLLP!
Blayne,"Uh, hey, o-over here, hello! In the cage!"
Buffy,(to Natalie) Let him go!
Blayne,Help me! Help me!
Buffy,(to Giles) Get them outta here!
Blayne,"Hey, help me! Help me!"
Buffy,"Remember Dr. Gregory? You scarfed his head? Yeah, well, he  taught me, you do your homework, you learn stuff. Like what happens to  your nervous system when you hear this!"
Tape,...extremely important to file not simply alphabetically...
Buffy,(back to Giles) Giles!
Giles,(on the floor pointing at Natalie) I-it's the wrong side!
Buffy,Bat sonar. Makes your whole nervous system go to Hell. You can  go there with it!
Giles,"Well, I... I'd say it's deceased."
Willow,And dissected.
Xander,(to Buffy) You okay?
Buffy,Yeah.
Xander,"Just for the record, you were right, I'm an idiot, and God  bless you!"
Xander,"(to the others) And thank you guys, too."
Blayne,"Yeah, really!"
Giles,Pleasure...
Willow,I'm really glad you're okay. It's so unfair how she only went  after virgins.
Xander,(to Willow) What?
Willow,"I mean, here you guys are, doing the right thing, the smart  thing, when a lot of other boys your age..."
Blayne,"Flag down on that play, babe. I am *not*..."
Giles,"(interrupts) Well, you see, that's the She-Mantis' modus  operandi. Uh, she only preys on the pure."
Xander,"Well, isn't this a perfect ending to a wonderful day!"
Blayne,"My dad's a lawyer. Anyone repeats this to anybody, they're  gonna find themselves facing a lawsuit."
Xander,Blayne! Shut up!
Willow,"I don't think it's bad, I think it's really..."
Willow,...sweet! It's certainly nothing I'll ever bring up again.
Angel,"(smiles) I heard a rumor there was, uh, one less vampire walking  around making a nuisance of himself."
Buffy,There is. Guess I should thank you for the tip.
Angel,Pleasure's mine.
Buffy,"Course, it would make things easier if I knew how to get in  touch with you."
Angel,I'll be around.
Buffy,Or who you were?
Buffy,"Well... Anyway, you can have your jacket back."
Angel,It looks better on you.
Buffy,(to herself) Oh boy!
Teacher,"All midterm papers will be exactly six pages long. No more, no  less. One third of your grade will be dependent..."
Teacher,"...on those papers. No more, no less."
