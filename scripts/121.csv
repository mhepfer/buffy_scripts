XANDER VOICEOVER,This is what happened this year.
WILLOW VOICEOVER,"Tomorrow night, we're bringing Buffy back."
XANDER VOICEOVER,You're talking about raising the dead.
BUFFY,I think I was in heaven. I was torn out of there by my friends.
GILES,I'm headed back to England.
GILES VOICEOVER,I plan to stay.
BUFFY,"So you three have, what, banded together to be pains in my ass?"
WARREN,We're your arch-nemesises.
TARA,"Willow, you are using too much magic."
TARA,I don't think this is gonna work.
WILLOW,Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
BUFFY VOICEOVER,Willow has a problem.
WILLOW,I need help!
SPIKE,"We kissed, Buffy. I'm in love with you."
BUFFY,You're in love with pain!
SPIKE,You afraid I'm gonna-
SPIKE,Things have changed.
BUFFY,The only thing that's different is that I'm disgusted with myself.
BUFFY,It's over. I'm using you.
XANDER,We're getting married.
DAWN,Congratulations.
ANYA,Xander's missing? What do you mean Xander's missing?
XANDER,I wish we could just go back to the way things were before.
ANYA,And I wish you were never born.
ANYA,"You left me, Xander! At the altar!"
XANDER,So you go out and bang the first body you can find?
SPIKE,It's good enough for Buffy.
XANDER,Shut up and leave her out of-
GILES VOICEOVER,"We can't ignore this kind of behavior. Something needs to be done before it spins out of control."
TARA,Can you just be kissing me now?
SPIKE,I'm gonna make you feel it!
BUFFY,"No, stop!"
BUFFY,Ask me again why I could never love you.
SPIKE,"Get nice and comfy, Slayer. I'll be back."
WARREN,Think you can just do that to me?
WILLOW,Tara?
WILLOW,Tara!
WILLOW,Bring her back!
DEMON,It is done!
WILLOW,Nooooo!
ANYA VOICEOVER,"Something terrible has happened, I know."
ANYA,You don't have to-
WILLOW,I need power.
XANDER,"Will, what are you doing? She's gonna die."
WILLOW,No she isn't.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,We need to find Willow.
DEMON,You want to return to your former self.
SPIKE,Bitch is gonna see a change.
WARREN,Somebody!! Please! God!
WILLOW,Bored now.
BUFFY,"Willow, what did you do?"
WILLOW,One down.
XANDER,I think I'm gonna be sick.
ANYA,Again?
BUFFY,"Xander, we don't have time."
XANDER,"(panting) I know, it's just ... what happened back there, the sounds of it. The smell. (Anya looking impatient)"
BUFFY,I know.
XANDER,Willow did that.
BUFFY,That's why we have to keep moving.
BUFFY,"You heard what she said, ""One down."""
ANYA,"So we're talking about ""two to go,"" right, Jonathan and whatshisface, the other guy."
BUFFY,"Andrew. They're sitting at county jail without a clue Willow's coming."
XANDER,"You don't think she's gonna kill them too? She wouldn't. It doesn't make sense."
BUFFY,"Willow's got an addictive personality, and she just tasted blood. She could be there already."
ANYA,"No. She couldn't, a witch at her level. She can only go airborne. (they stop walking and look at her) It's a thing. More flashy, impresses the locals, but it does take longer."
XANDER,Longer than what?
ANYA,Teleporting.
XANDER,"Right. Vengeance demon. (sarcastic) Well, at least she'll get there first."
BUFFY,I'm counting the ways that could go wrong. (they resume walking)
XANDER,"Well, Anya can handle herself."
BUFFY,Against Willow? Tonight ? Don't be too sure.
XANDER,"Well ... she should be coming down at some point, shouldn't she? I mean, back there she was out of her head ... running on grief and magicks."
BUFFY,"Doesn't matter . Willow just killed someone. Killing people changes you. Believe me, I know."
XANDER,"Warren was a cold-blooded killer of women just warming up. You ask me, that bastard had it coming to him."
BUFFY,Maybe. Andrew and Jonathan don't.
XANDER,"This is still Willow we're dealing with, right?"
BUFFY,"I hope so. Whatever she's going through, we have to stop her. And maybe we can actually do that if we can get to your..."
BUFFY,...car.
XANDER,Willow.
BUFFY,"I guess she wants to finish the job without us tagging along. (looks at Xander) Meet me at the jail."
XANDER,"Sure, how are you gonna..."
XANDER,"(calls after her) Okay, then, I'll just ... catch up. She's only my best friend, you know. No big deal, just..."
XANDER,...glad I could help.
ANDREW,"Dude. Move like, a foot to your left."
JONATHAN,(not moving) What for?
ANDREW,I'm trying to hear something.
JONATHAN,Like what?
ANDREW,(conspiratorially) Signals.
JONATHAN,"Oh, for crying out loud. (turns to face Andrew) Signals? Who from, your probe-happy alien friends? Say, maybe we can trade a pack of cigarettes in for tin foil. Make you a nice antenna hat."
ANDREW,"Laugh it up, fuzzball. I figured it out. (softly) Warren never abandoned us. Well, not me, anyway. This is like his test. If we can figure out how he's communicating with us, then we'll be, you know, worthy."
JONATHAN,(incredulous) You're checking for implants?
ANDREW,"(defensive) Lex Luthor had a false epidermis escape kit in ""Superman Versus the Amazing Spider-Man"" Treasury edition-"
JONATHAN,"Okay, first of all, those were sonic disrupters. And second of all ... you are sadness personified. Waiting for Warren? Yeah, maybe he'll come bust us out of here on Santa's magic sleigh."
ANDREW,(stands up angrily) I'm telling him you said that.
JONATHAN,Why wait? I'll tell him right now.
JONATHAN,"Hey, Warren, do you read me, your girlfriend's pathetic, over."
ANDREW,"(pulls his arm away) Shut up, Jerk-athan! You see this? This is why we get jet packs and all you get is left behind."
JONATHAN,So you admit it.
ANDREW,"(shrugs) Why not? You were out of the Trio a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away and you know why, little feller? No respect for the chain of command."
JONATHAN,"Yeah, see how far it's gotten you. Checking every hole in your sad little body for transmitters that don't exist."
ANDREW,Oh I'll find it if I have to check every hole in my body and yours.
JONATHAN,Get off!
ANDREW,Make me!
ANYA,There you two are.
ANDREW,(to Jonathan) You do that? (Jonathan shaking his head)
ANYA,"Listen to me. We have to get you out of here or you'll both be killed. (calls) Guard!"
JONATHAN,What's going on?
ANYA,Guard!
ANDREW,"Stop that! (to Jonathan) I don't trust her. Do you trust her? This is major uncool."
JONATHAN,"Um, Anya, you're gonna have to break this down for us a little."
ANYA,"(annoyed) Warren shot Buffy. Warren shot Tara. Buffy's alive. Tara's dead. Willow found out, and being the most powerful Wicca in the western hemisphere, decided to get the payback. With interest."
ANDREW,Wh-what about Warren?
ANYA,"She killed him. Ripped him apart and bloodied up the forest doing it. Now she's coming here and the two of you are next."
ANDREW,Oh my god ... Warren.
JONATHAN,Oh my god ... me. (turns to the bars and yells) Guard!
ANDREW,But we didn't do anything.
JONATHAN,Guard!!
OFFICER,"All right, all right, what do you..."
OFFICER,Who the hell are you?
ANYA,"Something's coming. Something bad. You have to let these men out of here or I guarantee you there will be hell to pay."
OFFICER,"Okay, uh ... what exactly's coming?"
ANYA,"One of the many things in this world you are not prepared to deal with."
OFFICER,(scoffs) That a fact?
ANYA,Yes. And we're running out of time. So just believe me when I tell you...
ANYA,...these things are real. They're dangerous. And they're coming.
PATROL COP,What the hell was that?
PATROL COP,"Listen, I don't know what you think you're doing, but just-"
WILLOW,Take a nap.
ANYA,"...so please, stop looking at me like it's your first trip to the circus and do your job. Let them out!"
OFFICER,You three stay here.
ANDREW,"Oh, like we have a choice!"
OFFICER,Don't move. You'll be safe here.
ANYA,Are you even listening?! This is the one place they won't be safe!
WILLOW,Back off.
COP,Hold it!
ANDREW,"(scared) Stop it, just stop! (to Jonathan) Why is she doing this? Tell her, we didn't do anything."
JONATHAN,"Yes we did. We signed on, we teamed up, we wanted to see where our plans would take us, well take a look."
JONATHAN,This is it.
ANDREW,Maybe for you.
"Buffy comes running up and stops beside the building, peering around the corner at the scene. We see it from Buffy's point of view","Willow standing surrounded by bricks and pieces of mortar, the crowd of cops pointing guns at her and yelling, other cops helping each other up off the ground."
ANDREW,"Anya. Teleport us out of here, please. Take us with you."
ANYA,I can't. It doesn't work that way.
ANDREW,"Oh, god. (more pieces of the wall coming off) HELP!"
WILLOW,Buffy.
ANYA,"Willow , just stop for a second and listen to-"
Same scene,"Willow still screaming. Cut to the street. Buffy, Jonathan, and Andrew come out of the police station through the same door that Buffy entered earlier. Willow's scream is audible. Andrew has his hands over his ears."
ANDREW,"Aah! What is that sound? God, it kills."
BUFFY,We have to make a run for it.
ANDREW,"Are you kidding? She's like Dark Phoenix up there! You expect us just to outrun her?"
BUFFY,Pretty much.
XANDER,Get in.
BUFFY,Is she coming?
XANDER,(checking rear-view mirror) I don't see anything.
BUFFY,(to Jonathan and Andrew in the back seat) Are you guys all right?
BUFFY,Are you injured?
JONATHAN,"I, I don't think so."
ANDREW,Where are you taking us?
BUFFY,"(pauses) We'll find someplace safe and we'll keep you there until we can stop Willow."
ANDREW,"Run and hide, that's your brilliant plan?"
JONATHAN,I don't believe this.
XANDER,"Boys, if you don't knock it off, I will pull this car over and you can just walk to your painful deaths from here."
JONATHAN,"I don't get it. Willow's a witch. Why doesn't she just , you know, wave her arms and make us dead?"
BUFFY,Because she doesn't want you dead. She wants to kill you.
ANDREW,But we didn't do anything.
ANDREW,(whiny) Ow!
XANDER,"Hate to admit it, Buff, but Jonathan may have a point. Why isn't she right here right now?"
BUFFY,"(uncertain) Maybe she's just getting her mojo up and running. Or maybe she hasn't figured out exactly how much power she really has yet. (beat) Neither have we."
XANDER,"Guess we keep running, then."
JONATHAN,"I still can't believe that was Willow. I mean, I've known her almost as long as you guys. Willow was ... you know. She packed her own lunches and wore floods and was always... just Willow."
JONATHAN,Geez it!
ANDREW,What was that?
XANDER,Just Willow.
XANDER,"O-okay, any ideas?"
BUFFY,Drive faster.
XANDER,This is faster!
JONATHAN,"She knows you're in this car too, right?"
JONATHAN,Right?!
JONATHAN,She's draining.
XANDER,She's what-ing?
JONATHAN,Just keep going.
ANDREW,(relieved laugh) Cool.
Cut to,"Spike's crypt. Dawn is standing by the windows, looking out nervously, fidgeting."
CLEM,"(O.S.) Not that I'm knocking the nacho cheese ones. I like the taste. It's just the texture I can't deal with."
CLEM,"So gritty. (Dawn looking at him) Kinda hurts my tongue. So, I'd give 'em a seven. Maybe a seven-five ... and, you think this is dumb, don't you?"
"DAWN: Uh, no! No, as taste tests go, this is definitely one of the better ones I've been to.CLEM","I get it. No biggie. (sighs) Uh, you wanna play cards?"
DAWN,Clem...
CLEM,"I can be a real boredom-buster, if you just give me half a chance."
DAWN,It's not you.
CLEM,"Still, I feel responsible. (walking over to her) It's not fair ... girl your age, cooped up in a crypt. Tell you what, let me get my hat and coat, I'll take you to a movie. We'll go nuts! (coaxing) PG-thirteen."
DAWN,(frustrated) Clem!
CLEM,Uh-huh?
DAWN,Look at me. Do I look weak to you? O-or incapable?
CLEM,Heck no.
DAWN,So why am I stuck here?
CLEM,"(shrugs) No good reason I can see. (sighs) I'm still real sorry about what happened. If there's anything I can do to help ... just name it."
DAWN,(sly) Anything?
CLEM,"Ohh ... you're not going to get yourself in trouble now, are you? Or me? 'Cause your sister's the Slayer; I'm a demon, that's real good incentive to get along with her."
DAWN,I need a demon to help me.
DAWN,Spike would have.
CLEM,Spike's gone.
Cut to,"the African cave. It's very dark. Spike stands there, shirtless and barefoot, wearing his black pants, pacing a little. The shadowy demon from ""Villains"" speaks to him."
DEMON,"You understand, then."
SPIKE,"Yeah. (bored) Yeah, it's not like you haven't been clear about it, oh great mysterious one. This is a test. I don't get what I want unless I pass said test. That about the size and shape?"
DEMON,Yes.
SPIKE,"And since your pad is decked out gladiator-style, and no number two pencils have been provided ... I guess we're not starting with the written."
SPIKE,"Oh, here we go then. Just me and the walking action figure. I'm venturing this would be the kill-or-be-killed type of situation, then?"
DEMON,To the death.
SPIKE,Right.
SPIKE,Here we are now. Entertain us.
SPIKE,"Oh, son of a b..."
Cut to,"a back alley somewhere, night. Two people walk along. Cut closer to reveal they are Clem and Dawn."
DAWN,Rack's place was right around here last time.
CLEM,"Oh, huh, I don't feel anything. (quickly) Oh well. Not here. Let's go home."
DAWN,"You don't feel anything because his place moves. I told you. (they stop walking)"
CLEM,"Know why Rack moves all the time? Because he's shady. A bad element comes down here."
DAWN,"I get that. But Willow's part of it now. She is the element. If she isn't around somewhere, Rack may know where she is. Which is why we need to talk to him."
CLEM,(nervous) We? In a face to face way?
DAWN,(impatient) Or me. I'll go in there without you.
CLEM,"No, no, it's fine, I'm good, it's just, Rack isn't partial to the floppy-eared. (Dawn looking skeptical) He has a thing! But, but hey, I'm in. Absolutely."
DAWN,Either way. Just get me there. (resumes walking)
CLEM,"Say Rack does know where Willow is. He's not going to tell you for nothing. He's gonna want something."
DAWN,I have money.
CLEM,"(sighs) That's not the kind of something he's gonna want. Rack likes little girls."
DAWN,"(stops walking, angrily) I am not a little girl."
CLEM,"I, I don't know if you've thought this through. I'm supposed to keep you safe (Dawn looking annoyed) and this whole thing is... I mean, even if you find Willow ... you really think you can stop her?"
XANDER,"Thanks, Anya, for getting here so fast. It's a big help."
ANYA,"Once again, Xander in need of the big help."
XANDER,"Whatever. So, can you still sense Willow? Knowing her location'd be a real big comfort right about now."
ANYA,"No, I can't. Which means whatever she's feeling, it's gone way beyond simple vengeance."
XANDER,Did I mention me needing the comfort?
BUFFY,"Whatever we've got, better grab it fast. This is one of the first places she's gonna think to look for us."
ANDREW,"(alarmed) Then what are we doing here? You know, I could summon a demon that would kill her."
"XANDER: And I could smack you so hard your eyeballs would switch sockets.BUFFY",No one is getting killed. Sit down.
"BUFFY: We need to find some sort of magicks that'll stop Willow. Or at least slow her down.XANDER",But she drained the place.
XANDER,(holding up a book) Took everything.
ANYA,Not everything.
XANDER,What is it?
ANYA,"Um, book of protection spells. Anti-magic, our last resort."
XANDER,Think you can work this stuff?
ANYA,"(looking at book) Ah. Okay. Well, the good news is, text is intact. Bad news is, ah, I can't read a word of it. It's like in, ancient Sumerian or something."
JONATHAN,Could I take a look at it?
BUFFY,Shut up.
JONATHAN,Right.
JONATHAN,"I just thought, you know, as long as you're protecting us, the least I could do is-"
BUFFY,"I'm not protecting you, Jonathan. None of us are. We're doing this for Willow. The only reason it happens to be your lucky day? Is because Willow kills you, she crosses a line, I lose a friend. (gets right up in Jonathan's face) And I hate losing."
JONATHAN,"I get that. It's just ... you know she's running out of power, right? I can tell. I can practically feel it. (quietly, embarrassed) I've dabbled in the magicks."
XANDER,"I think Willow's in a league of her own about now, dabble-boy."
JONATHAN,"But still, running that hot for that long, it's just a matter of time before you gotta re-charge, no matter how juiced up you are."
BUFFY,Thank you. Now you remember that thing we talked about?
JONATHAN,About me shutting up?
JONATHAN,(whispers) Right.
XANDER,"Buffy, let's say this works. And we stop Willow from working the hoodoo for a minute. What then?"
BUFFY,I talk to her.
XANDER,Great. And say what?
BUFFY,"Look ... whatever she's gonna do, she starts with those two. (indicating Andrew and Jonathan)  They're the line she cannot cross. And if she's running low on magicks ? Then she's probably somewhere right now trying to get it all back."
Cut to,"Rack's place, night. The door opens (POV of someone entering the room), revealing a junkie boy lying blissed-out on the floor with his eyes closed, holding a lit cigarette. Pan over to Rack, sitting on the floor between a sofa and a coffee-table, laying out runestones on the sofa. He doesn't look at the camera."
RACK,"Hey, babe. I been waiting for you."
RACK,"Guess the rehab didn't take, huh. That's the way it goes sometimes."
RACK,"But I gotta say ... I could feel you coming a mile away, the power you got. And you know something, sweetness? (whispers) I liked it."
RACK,"When you first came to me, you were just a little ... slip of a girl."
RACK,"Look at you now, all ... growed up. So full of dark juice."
RACK,"And you still taste like strawberries. Only now ... (moves around in front of her) ...you're ripe."
RACK,You came because you want something. Don't you?
RACK,"I thought so. (stroking her cheek) So tell me, Strawberry..."
RACK,...what on this earth do you want?
WILLOW,Just to take a little tour.
DAWN,"Yay, Clem, making with the demon senses! I knew you'd find this place."
CLEM,(softly) It's not very clean.
DAWN,Don't wig out on me again.
CLEM,"It's just, I'm still not so sure you should be here. I'm not so sure *I* should be here."
DAWN,It'll only take a minute. Come on.
DAWN,You wanna wait here?
CLEM,(relieved) If that works for you...
DAWN,Be right back.
DAWN,Willow?
WILLOW,"Hey, cutie."
WILLOW,"Dawnie, what are you doing here? 'Cause if you're looking for me? Now's not a great time."
DAWN,You look terrible.
WILLOW,Do I?
DAWN,You're back on the magicks.
WILLOW,"No, honey. I am the magicks."
DAWN,(backing away as Willow advances) Did you kill that guy?
WILLOW,"(shrugging) It's an improvement, believe me."
DAWN,(very nervous) I have to go.
WILLOW,Why? So you can run and tell Buffy?
DAWN,"Willow ... please, just listen to me."
WILLOW,You don't have to talk. Just think real loud. I can hear you.
DAWN,You're freaking me out.
WILLOW,"Oh, don't be like that. I'm just a little wired. And I have some things to do. I thought if anybody'd understand-"
DAWN,"I miss Tara, too!"
DAWN,"But this? What you're doing here? This is not the way to go! You're only going to make things worse! But I promise, it's not too late to-"
WILLOW,You miss her?
DAWN,(shocked) Yes.
WILLOW,"Did you cry? (Dawn still looking shocked) Of course you did. I get that."
WILLOW,"I understand the crying, you cry because you're human. But you weren't always."
DAWN,"(hurt) Yes, I was."
WILLOW,"No, please. You're telling me you don't remember? You used to be some ... mystic ball of energy. Maybe that's why you're crying all the time, Dawnie. 'Cause you don't belong here."
WILLOW,"Wanna go back? End the pain? You'll be happier. I'll be happier. We'll all be a lot happier without listening to the constant whining."
DAWN,"(tearful and angry) Willow, stop..."
WILLOW,"(mock-whining) ""Mom!"" ""Buffy!"" ""Tara!"" ""Waah!"" It's time you go back to being a little energy ball."
WILLOW,"No more tears, Dawnie."
BUFFY,I think you need to get away from her.
ANYA,You're too close.
XANDER,How am I supposed to read?
ANYA,"I don't know, I'm staring right at this stuff and I can't read it."
XANDER,"Well, how's the translation coming?  (Anya looking very annoyed)What have we got so far?"
ANYA,"(sighs, looks at notebook) So far we've got ""the."" Well, either ""the"" or ""towards,"" I'm not really sure. (writes something down) I can't do this. I'm in retail. Stupid ancient Sumerian."
JONATHAN,(O.S.) I'm pretty sure it's Babylonian.
JONATHAN,"The text is similar, but the dialect is completely different."
XANDER,"Great. Babylonian. Thanks a bushel. But unless you can read Babylonian, why don't you sit back down."
ANDREW,(softly) Why are you helping them?
JONATHAN,"Because they're saving our lives, you moron."
ANDREW,"Uh-huh. And what then? Even if they kill that Wicca bitch, you think they're just gonna let us walk? They own us."
JONATHAN,So what do you want me to do?
ANDREW,Look around. You know magic. We're in a magic shop. We can take them.
ANDREW,"The books are sucked dry, but so what?  There's still like tons of supplies all around us. This is the best chance we're gonna get to make it out of here."
JONATHAN,And do what?
ANDREW,"Start over. We can be a Duo. You and me. You can even be the leader, I swear, I'll take orders. (Jonathan looking contemplative) I like taking orders. Just tell me what to do."
JONATHAN,You want an order?
JONATHAN,Grow up.
XANDER,"Hey now, play nice, fellas, or you'll break our concentration."
ANYA,Which means no protection spell.
XANDER,"And Willow will make you two boneless chickens skinless, too."
ANDREW,"And then what? You think your little witch buddy's gonna stop with us? (Xander and Anya glaring at him) You saw her! She's a truck-driving Magic Mama! And we've got maybe seconds before Darth Rosenberg grinds everybody into Jawa-burgers, and not one of you bunch has the midichlorians to stop her."
XANDER,"You've never had any tiny bit of sex, have you?"
ANYA,"The annoying virgin has a point. What if Willow fillets their soles and then comes after us?"
XANDER,She won't.
ANYA,You don't know that.
XANDER,"We're her friends, Anya. Her family. She would never hurt us."
ANYA,"She tried to use you for a hood ornament, Xander. She doesn't care if you live or die."
XANDER,Guess you two finally have something in common
ANYA,"I care if you live or die, Xander. I'm just not sure which one I want."
XANDER,"Again with the comfort. Look, we both know things might get ugly at, uh,  Wiccapalooza. And if it gets really bad..."
ANYA,(still not looking at him) Let me guess. You'll propose?
XANDER,"I need to know if you're gonna turn on me. Use this little shindig as an excuse for some sweet revenge."
ANYA,"(finally turns to look at him) There is nothing in this world that could give me greater or more lasting satisfaction than to reap bloody vengeance upon you, Xander Harris. But I can't. Not officially, not magically . (sarcastic) So smile, it's your lucky day. You got away with it, I can't hurt you."
XANDER,"Right, 'cause you varnishing the table with Spike, how could that possibly have hurt? It may have chafed..."
ANYA,(more quietly) That wasn't vengeance. It was solace.
ANYA,"(sighs) Look ... I really can't hurt you, so, I'm just gonna have to settle for hating you."
XANDER,If that's what you need to do.
ANYA,(angry) Don't! You don't get to play the martyr.
XANDER,I'm not.
ANYA,"You know, none of this would be happening if it weren't for you."
XANDER,"You think I don't know that? You think I'm the hero of this piece? (upset) I saw the gun. Before Warren raised it, I ... I saw it, and I couldn't move. He shot two of my friends ... before I could even.... You want me to know how useless I am? That it's my fault? Thanks. Already got the memo."
ANYA,(softly) I was talking about us.
BUFFY,"You need to back down a minute  and think, Will."
WILLOW,I wasn't gonna hurt her. Buzzkill.
DAWN,"(whispers, upset) She tried to turn me back..."
BUFFY,(advancing slowly) You're attacking the people who love you now?
WILLOW,Only the ones in my way.
BUFFY,That's not ... You need help.
WILLOW,"I'm doing fine on my own, thanks."
BUFFY,"Dawn, get out of here. Go!"
WILLOW,Don't. We're all friends.
BUFFY,"Willow, I know what you want to do, but you have to listen to me. The forces inside you are incredibly powerful. They're strong ... but you're stronger. (Dawn cowering in the corner) You have to remember  you're still Willow."
WILLOW,"(scoffs) Let me tell you something about Willow. (advancing toward Buffy) She's a loser. And she always has been. People picked on Willow in junior high school, high school, up until college. With her stupid mousy ways. And now? Willow's a junkie."
BUFFY,I can help.
WILLOW,The only thing Willow was ever good for...
WILLOW,"...the only thing I had going for me ... were the moments  - just moments - when Tara would look at me and I was wonderful. (grimly) And that will never happen again."
BUFFY,"I know this hurts. Bad. But Willow, if you let loose with the magicks, it will never end."
WILLOW,(smiles nastily) Promise?
BUFFY,You don't want that.
WILLOW,Why not?
BUFFY,"Because you lose everything. Your friends, your self.... Willow, if you let this control you then the world goes away. And all of us with it. There's so much to live for. (forcefully) Will, there's too much-"
WILLOW,"(scoffs) Oh, please! This is your pitch? Buffy, you hate it here as much as I do. I'm just more honest about it."
BUFFY,That's not true.
WILLOW,You're trying to sell me on the world.
WILLOW,"The one where you lie to your friends when you're not trying to kill them? And you screw a vampire just to feel? And insane asylums are the comfy alternative? This world? Buffy, it's me. I know you were happier when you were in the ground. The only time you were ever at peace in your whole life is when you were dead. Until Willow brought you back."
WILLOW,"You know, with magic?"
WILLOW,"Oh. Sorry, the trip can be kind of rough..."
WILLOW,"...if you're, you know , not me."
BUFFY,Dawn!
WILLOW,"Jonathan. Andrew. (the geeks looking scared) You boys like magic, don't you?"
WILLOW,Abracadabra.
WILLOW,Okay. Didn't see that coming.
ANDREW,W-what was that?
JONATHAN,We're alive.
WILLOW,"You guys want to take it slow? (Jonathan and Andrew exchanging a fearful look) I can do that, too. (smiles) Ask Warren."
BUFFY,Don't!
JONATHAN,Let's get out of here.
WILLOW,"No no, stay."
WILLOW,"I mean, we're just getting started."
WILLOW,I've got big party plans.
BUFFY,Will-
XANDER,"(to Buffy) No, don't."
WILLOW,"Guys, come on. I'm just getting wood for the violence here. And you know what they say ... if at first you don't succeed..."
SPIKE,Had enough?
SPIKE,"(holding up his burnt hand) Bad move, bad move, bad move..."
SPIKE,Looks like local boy loses.
DEMON,So it would appear.
SPIKE,"Good on me, then. I get what I came for. I passed, right?"
DEMON,Indeed. You have passed the first stage of the test.
SPIKE,"Right, I get... (pauses) Wait. First stage?"
SPIKE,Bugger.
WILLOW,"Damn, that is one effective counter-spell."
WILLOW,"Won't keep you alive, though."
BUFFY,"Will, stop. You need to give this up now."
WILLOW,"(ignoring her) I get it. You boys put a, a spell on yourselves, didn't you. Protecting you from harm ... from magicks. That's cute."
BUFFY,"Will, back off before somebody gets hurt."
WILLOW,"How 'bout I back off right after? (to nerds) So, which one of you boys worked the mojo?"
WILLOW,"Doesn't matter, really. I'm just curious."
WILLOW,"Just because I can't do magicks to you, doesn't mean I can't do them on myself."
WILLOW,Now I'm pretty sure I'm strong enough to beat you to death.
BUFFY,I don't want to hurt you.
WILLOW,Not a problem.
BUFFY,I said I didn't *want* to.
BUFFY,Didn't say I wouldn't.
XANDER,Let's go.
JONATHAN,What about Willow?
XANDER,Buffy can handle her.
DAWN,Are you sure?
XANDER,"No, that's why we're leaving."
XANDER,Come on!
ANYA,"I can't, I, I have to stay here to keep the spell going on Willow."
XANDER,"No, but..."
ANYA,"(harshly) Go, do something right!"
WILLOW,No!
WILLOW,So. (smiling) Here we are.
BUFFY,Are we really gonna do this?
WILLOW,"Come on, this is a huge deal for me! Six years as a side man, and now I get to be the Slayer."
BUFFY,"A killer isn't a Slayer. Being a Slayer means something you can't conceive of."
WILLOW,"(sighing, shaking her head) Oh, Buffy. You really need to have every square inch of your ass kicked."
BUFFY,Then show me what you got. And I'll show you what a Slayer really is.
ANDREW,Where are you taking us?
DAWN,Someplace safe.
JONATHAN,Like where?
DAWN,Xander?
XANDER,I don't know.
WILLOW,"Get off, super-bitch."
BUFFY,I can help you stop.
WILLOW,I thought you were gonna show me what a Slayer was.
JONATHAN,Can't ... run any more. (they stop) I need to ... breathe.
XANDER,"If you wanna keep breathing, you gotta keep moving."
ANDREW,"(to Xander) This is bogus. We gotta get out of this town. (realizing something, turning to Jonathan) Mexico. We should go to Mexico."
XANDER,"Hey. You're not going anywhere. We just gotta find a place to hide you two until we get the all-clear from Buffy."
ANDREW,"Yeah, and what if the Slayer's dead already? (Dawn looking alarmed) We're just supposed to sit around waiting for Sabrina to show up and disembowel us?"
XANDER,You do what I say to-
ANDREW,I don't think so.
WILLOW,"Well, hey. Isn't that interesting. Anya's still here."
WILLOW,Looks like I've been beating on the wrong gal.
XANDER,"Whoa, whoa. Okay, Andy. Let's just put the sword down."
ANDREW,"Oh, no way. I'm not gonna die because of something I didn't even do."
XANDER,You're not gonna die.
DAWN,(firmly) Leave him alone.
JONATHAN,"Let him go, Andrew. (beat) You heard me."
ANDREW,You let me go first.
JONATHAN,Uh-uh. Him.
ANDREW,It's your move.
JONATHAN,No. Yours.
ANDREW,I'm not moving. (Dawn watching tensely) I'm not gonna budge 'til...
ANDREW,...right now. (whiny) Ow!
JONATHAN,"Xander's right. We're not leaving Sunnydale. When this is over, you and I are going back to jail to do our time."
ANYA,Help me!
ANYA,Help me! (to Willow) You're hurting me.
WILLOW,"You can't block my spells if you can't chant. And you can't chant if you're sleepin'."
WILLOW,"Buffy ... I gotta tell ya ... I get it now. The Slayer thing really isn't about the violence."
WILLOW,It's about the power.
WILLOW,And there's no one in the world with the power to stop me now.
GILES,I'd like to test that theory.
