Lyrics,"<I>I don't say much but I, but I like to sing</I>"
Cordelia,I know. Is the Bronze so not happening? Or what? (sets down  her drink and sits)
Angel,Oh. Hi.
Lyrics,<I>Won't tell you what I'm thinking</I>
Cordelia,Hi!
Angel,I'm waiting for Buffy.
Lyrics,<I>Just have to wait and sing</I>
Cordelia,"Great! I'm supposed to be meeting Devon, but he's nowhere to  be seen. It's like he thinks being in a band gives him an obligation to  flake."
Cordelia,"Well, his loss is your incredible gain!"
Cordelia,"So I told Devon, 'You call that leather interior? My Barbie  Dream Car had nicer seats!' (they both laugh)"
Lyrics,"<I>I have no skin left on my, on my fingertips</I>"
Angel,Buffy?
Angel,Buffy!
Lyrics,"<I>But still my heart pours out, out from my lips</I>"
Buffy,(turns back around) Hi! I'm...
Angel,Late.
Buffy,Rough day at the office.
Angel,So I see.
Lyrics,"<I>Well I'm mute, but I'm not quite mute</I>"
Buffy,"Hey, it's a look. A seasonal look."
Lyrics,<I>And I say the things you want to hear</I>
Cordelia,(appears behind Angel) Buffy. Love the hair. It just screams  street urchin. (leaves)
Lyrics,"<I>I'm mute, but I'm not quite mute</I>"
Buffy,(smiles) Know what? I need to go... (loses the smile) put a bag  over my head. (starts to go)
Lyrics,<I>And I keep to myself to defend</I>
Angel,(grabs her arm) Don't listen to her. Please. You look fine.
Lyrics,<I>Yeah I'm alright</I>
Buffy,"You're sweet. A terrible liar, but sweet."
Lyrics,<I>Oh now don't want to fight</I>
Angel,I thought we had...
Buffy,A date. So did I. But who am I kidding?
Lyrics,<I>I'm an angel burning out / Oh now</I>
Buffy,Dates are things normal girls have. Girls who have time to think  about nail polish and facials. You know what I think about? Ambush  tactics. Beheading. Not exactly the stuff dreams are made of. (turns and  goes out the door)
Cordelia,(comes back) Cappuccino?
Girl,Hey!
Snyder,You're volunteering.
Girl,But I have to get to class.
Willow,Snyder must be in charge of the volunteer safety program for  Halloween this year.
Xander,Note his interesting take on the volunteer concept.
Buffy,What's the deal?
Xander,"Oh, a bunch of little kids need people to take them trick-or- treating. Sign up and get your own pack of sugar-hyped little runts for  the night."
Buffy,Yikes. I'll stick to vampires.
Snyder,Miss Summers. Just the juvenile delinquent I've been looking  for.
Buffy,Principal Snyder!
Snyder,"Halloween must be a big night for you. Tossing eggs, keying  cars, bobbing for apples, one pathetic cry for help after another. Well,  (leads her to the sign-up table) not this year, missy."
Buffy,"Gosh, I'd love to sign up, but I recently developed carpal  tunnel syndrome, and can tragically no longer hold a flashlight."
Snyder,"The program starts at four, the children have to be back at  six."
Xander,I can't believe this. We have to get dressed up and the whole  deal?
Willow,Snyder said costumes were mandatory.
Buffy,Great. I was gonna stay in and veg. The one night a year things  are supposed to be quiet for me.
Xander,"Halloween quiet? Oh, I figured it'd be a big old vamp scare- apalooza."
Buffy,"Not according to Giles. He swears that tomorrow night is, like,  dead for the undead. (the girls sit) They stay in."
Xander,(smiling) Those wacky vampires! That's why I love 'em! They  just keep you guessing!
Larry,Harris!
Xander,"Hey, Lar. You're lookin' Cro-Mag as usual. What can I do you  for?"
Larry,"You and Buffy, you're just friends, right?"
Xander,I like to think of it less as a friendship and more as a solid  foundation for future bliss.
Larry,"So, she, she's not your girlfriend?"
Xander,"Alas, no."
Larry,Do you think she'd go out with me?
Xander,"Well, Lar, that's a tough question to... No. Not a chance."
Larry,Why not? I heard some guys say she was fast.
Xander,I hope you mean like the wind.
Larry,"Yeah, you know what I mean."
Xander,That's my friend that you're talkin' about!
Larry,"Oh, yeah? Well, what're you gonna do about it?"
Xander,I'm gonna do what any man would do about it: (grabs Larry by  the shirt) somethin' damn manly.
Buffy,Get gone.
Buffy,Ooo! Diet! (grabs the can)
Xander,Do you know what you just did?
Buffy,Saved you a dollar?
Xander,"No, but Larry was about to pummel me!"
Buffy,"Oh, that? Forget about it! (heads back to the table)"
Xander,"Oh, I'll forget about it. (follows her) In maybe fifteen,  twenty years when my rep for being a sissy man finally fades!"
Buffy,"(stops and faces him) Xander, don't you think you're..."
Xander,"(interrupts) A black eye heals, Buffy, but cowardice has an  unlimited shelf life. Oh, thanks! Thanks a lot for *your* help."
Buffy,I think I just violated the guy code big time.
Willow,"Poor Xander. Boys are so fragile. Speaking of, how was your  date last night?"
Buffy,Misfire. I was late due to unscheduled slayage. Showed up  looking trashed.
Willow,Was he mad?
Buffy,Actually he was pretty unmad. Which probably had something to do  with the fact that Cordelia was drooling in his cappuccino.
Willow,"Oh, Buffy. Angel would never fall for her act."
Buffy,"You mean that 'actually showing up, wearing a stunning outfit,  embracing personal hygiene' act?"
Willow,"You know what I mean. Uh, she's not his type."
Buffy,"Are you sure? I mean, I don't know what his type is. I've known  him less than a year, and if you haven't noticed, he's not exactly one  to over share."
Willow,True. It's too bad we can't sneak a look at the Watcher diaries  and read up on Angel. I'm sure it's full of fun facts to know and tell.
Buffy,Yeah. It's too bad. That stuff is private.
Willow,Also Giles keeps them in his office. In his personal files.
Buffy,"Most importantly, it would be wrong."
Giles,Buffy!
Giles,Excellent!
Buffy,Nothing! Hi!
Giles,"Yes, I-I just wanted to talk to you about tomorrow night. As it  should be, uh, calm, you might work on some new battle techniques."
Buffy,"You're beginning to scare me, Giles. You need to have some fun."
Buffy,"You know, there's this place you can go, right, and you sit in  the dark, and there are these moving pictures, right, and the pictures  tell a story."
Giles,"Yes, yes, ha, ha, very droll."
Giles,"I'll have you know that I have very, uh, many relaxing hobbies."
Buffy,Such as?
Giles,"Well, um..."
Giles,I enjoy cross-referencing.
Buffy,"Do you stuff your own shirts, or do you send them out?"
Buffy,"So! How come Halloween is such a big yawner? I mean, do the  demons just hate how commercial it's become? (leafs through the book)"
Giles,"(puts his books down) Um, it's interesting, ac... Not, I  suspect, to you. (takes the book from her) What is it you're after?"
Buffy,"Of course, it's of interest to me! I'm the Slayer. I need to  know these things. You can't keep me in the dark any longer."
Buffy,Look at me when I talk to you!
Giles,I really don't have time for these games.
Buffy,Ms. Calendar said you were a babe.
Giles,She said what?
Buffy,"(meekly) Well, she said that you were a... h-hunk of burning...  something or other. So, (exhales) whadaya think of that?"
Giles,"Uh, I... (exhales) I don't, um, uh... A burning hunk of what?"
Buffy,"Look. You know how disgusting it is for me to even contemplate  you grownups having smoochies, (sees Willow come out of the office with  a diary) but I think you should go for it."
Giles,"Buffy, I appreciate your interest, but..."
Buffy,"But I've overstepped my bounds. It's none of my business, you  know. (stammers) What was I thinking? My God! Shame, (Willow goes out  the door) shame. I gotta go. (quickly walks out)"
Giles,(not sure what to make of it) A babe? (smirks) I can live with  that.
Buffy,"Man, look at her."
Willow,Who is she?
Buffy,"It doesn't say, but the entry's dated 1775."
Willow,Angel was eighteen. And still human.
Buffy,So that's the kinda girl he hung around? She's pretty coiffed.
Willow,She looks like a noble woman or something. Which means being  beautiful is sort of her job.
Buffy,And clearly this girl was a workaholic. I'll never be like this.
Willow,"C'mon! She's not that pretty. I mean, look at her. She's got a  funny... uh, waist. Look how tiny that is."
Buffy,(sarcastically) Thank you. Now I feel better.
Willow,(exhales) No. She's like a freak. A circus freak. Yuk.
Buffy,"(exhales) Musta been wonderful. Put on some fantabulous gown and  go to a ball like a princess, and have horses and servants, and yet more  gowns."
Willow,"Yeah. Still, I think I prefer being able to vote. (Buffy raises  her brows) (smiles) Or I will when I can."
Cordelia,"So, Buffy. You ran off last night and left poor little Angel  all by his lonesome. But I did everything I could to comfort him."
Buffy,I'll bet.
Cordelia,"(gets out her blush) So, what's his story anyway? I mean, I  never see him around. (brushes some onto her cheeks)"
Willow,"Not during the day, anyway."
Cordelia,"Oh, please. Don't tell me he still lives at home. Like, he  has to wait for his dad to get back before he can take the car? (puts  the blush away)"
Buffy,"Cordelia, I think his parents have been dead for a couple of  hundred years."
Cordelia,"(touches up her lip gloss) Oh, good. I mean... (faces them)  What?"
Buffy,Angel's a vampire. I thought you knew.
Cordelia,"(turns back to the mirror) Oh, he's a vampire. (puts away the  lip gloss) Of course! But the cuddly kind. Like a Carebear with fangs?"
Willow,It's true.
Cordelia,"(steps over to them) You know what I think? (crosses her  arms) I just think you're trying to scare me off 'cause you're afraid of  the competition. Look, Buffy, you may be hot stuff when it comes to  demonology or whatever, but when it comes to dating, I'm the Slayer."
Buffy,What'd you get?
Willow,A time-honored classic! (holds up a ghost costume)
Buffy,"Okay, Will, can I give you a little friendly advice?"
Willow,It's not spooky enough?
Buffy,It's just... you're never gonna get noticed if you keep hiding.  You're missing the whole point of Halloween.
Willow,(smiles) Free candy?
Buffy,It's come as you aren't night. The perfect chance for a girl to  get sexy and wild with no repercussions.
Willow,"Oh, I don't get wild. Wild on me equals spaz."
Buffy,Don't underestimate yourself. You've got it in you.
Willow,"Hey, Xander!"
Willow,What'd you get?
Buffy,That's not a costume.
Xander,"(gives Buffy a look, then turns to Willow) I got fatigues from  an Army surplus at home. Call me the Two-Dollar Costume King, baby!"
Buffy,"Hey, look, Xander... (he points the rifle at her) I'm... really  sorry about this morning."
Xander,"Do you mind, Buffy? I'm trying to repress."
Buffy,"Okay, then I promise, from now on I'll let you get pummeled.  (puts her chin on his shoulder and pouts)"
Xander,"(rolls his eyes) Thank you. (Buffy smiles) Okay, y'know,  actually I think I could've t..."
Xander,Hello! That was our touching reconciliation moment there.
Buffy,"I'm sorry, it's just... Look at this."
Willow,It's amazing.
Xander,Too bulky. I prefer my women in spandex.
Ethan,"Please, let me."
Buffy,"Oh, i-it's..."
Ethan,"Magnificent. Yes, I know. There. (holds it up to her in a  mirror) My. Meet the hidden princess. I think we found a match. Don't  you?"
Buffy,"(looks at Ethan) Oh, uh, I-I'm sorry. There's no way I could  ever afford this."
Ethan,"Oh, nonsense. I feel quite moved to make you a deal you can't  refuse."
Spike,Here it comes. (watches) Rewind that. Let's see that again.
Spike,(chuckles) She's tricky. Baby likes to play.
Spike,You see that? The way she stakes him with that thing? That's  what's called resourceful. Rewind it again.
Drusilla,(comes from the other room) Miss Edith needs her tea.
Spike,"C'mere, poodle. (holds his hand out to her)"
Drusilla,(takes his hand) Do you love my insides? The parts you can't  see?
Spike,"Eyeballs to entrails, my sweet. That's why I've got to study  this Slayer. Once I know her I can kill her. And once I kill her you can  have your run of Sunnyhell. Get strong again."
Drusilla,Don't worry. Everything's switching. Outside to inside.  (breathes at Spike's neck) It makes her weak.
Spike,Really? Did my pet have a vision?
Drusilla,Do you know what I miss? Leeches.
Spike,"Come on, talk to Daddy. This thing that makes the Slayer weak?  When is it?"
Drusilla,Tomorrow.
Spike,Tomorrow's Halloween. Nothing happens on Halloween.
Drusilla,Someone's come to change it all. Someone new.
Ethan,"The world that denies thee, thou inhabit."
Ethan,"The peace that ignores thee,..."
Ethan,...thou corrupt.
Ethan,"Chaos. I remain, as ever, thy faithful, degenerate son."
Willow,Where're you meeting Angel?
Buffy,Here. After trick-or-treating. Mom's gonna be out.
Willow,Does he know about your costume?
Buffy,"Nope. Call it a blast from his past. I'll show him I can coif  with the best of 'em. (turns to the bathroom door) Okay, Willow, come  out. You can't hide in there all night."
Willow,"O-okay, but, but promise you won't laugh?"
Buffy,I promise.
Buffy,(smiles) Wow! You're a dish!
Buffy,"I mean, really."
Willow,But this just isn't me.
Buffy,"And that's the point. (walks around Willow to show her the  mirror) Look, Halloween is the night that not you *is* you, but not  *you*. Y'know?"
Buffy,Oh! That's Xander. Are you ready?
Willow,(nervous) Yeah. O-o-okay.
Buffy,Cool! I can't wait for the boys to go non-verbal when they see  you! (goes to get the door)
Xander,"Private Harris reporting for... (sees Buffy in her costume)  Buffy! Lady of Buffdom, Duchess of Buffonia, I am in awe! I completely  renounce spandex!"
Buffy,"(curtsies) Thank you, kind sir. (Xander bows) But wait till you  see..."
Willow,Hi.
Buffy,...Casper.
Xander,"Hey, Will! That's aaa fine boo you got there."
Snyder,"This is your group, Summers. No need to speak to them. The last  thing they need is your influence. Just bring them back in one piece and  I won't expel you. (starts to leave)"
Buffy,(bends down to the kids) Hi.
Snyder,"Ah, ah!"
Larry,"Where's your bodyguard, Harris? Curling her hair?"
Cordelia,Oz. Oz.
Oz,"(looks up at her) Hey, Cordelia. Jeez, you're like a great big cat."
Cordelia,It's my costume. Are you guys playing tonight?
Oz,"Yeah, at the Shelter Club."
Cordelia,Is Mr. I'm-the-lead-singer-I'm-so-great-I-don't-have-to-show- up-for-my-date-or-even-call gonna be there?
Oz,"Yeah, y'know, he's just going by 'Devon' now."
Cordelia,"Well, you can tell him that I don't care, and that I didn't  even mention it. And that I didn't even see you. So that's just fine."
Oz,"So, what do I tell him?"
Cordelia,Nothing! Jeez! Get with the program. (walks off in a huff)
Oz,(sarcastically) Why can't I meet a nice girl like that?
Oz,Oh! I'm sorry.
Willow,Sorry.
Oz,I'm sorry.
Willow,Sorry.
Oz,Sorry.
Xander,"Okay, on sleazing extra candy: tears are key. Tears will  normally get you the double-bagger. You can also try the old 'you missed  me' routine, but it's risky. Only go there for chocolate. Understood?"
Xander,"Okay, troops."
Xander,Let's move out.
Buffy,What did Mrs. Davis give you?
Buffy,She must be stopped. Let's hit one more house. (gets up) We  still have a few more minutes before I need to get you back.
Ethan,"Janus, evoco vestram animam. Exaudi meam causam. Carpe noctem  pro consilio vestro. Veni, appare et nobis monstra quod est infinita  potestas."
Translation,"Janus, I invoke your spirit. Hear my plea. Seize the night  for your own reason. Come, appear and show to us that which is infinite  power."
Willow,"C'mon, guys."
Kids,Trick-or-treat!
Lady,"Oh, my goodness, aren't you adorable!"
Ethan,Persona se corpum et sanguium commutandum est. Vestra sancta  praesentia concrescet viscera. Janus! Sume noctem!
Translation,The mask transforms itself into flesh and blood. Your holy  presence curdles the heart. Janus! Take the night!
Lady,"Oh, dear! Am I all out?"
Ethan,Showtime!
Lady,I could've sworn I had more candy.
Lady,"I'm sorry, mister monster. (bends down) Maybe I..."
Willow,No! Let her go!
Willow,Stop! What're you doing?!
Willow,Stop! Hey!
Willow,Ohmigod! Can't breathe...
Willow,Ohmigod! I'm a real ghost!
Willow,Xander?
Willow,Xander!
Willow,"It's me, Willow!"
Xander,I don't know any Willow.
Willow,"Xander, quite messing around. This is no time for jokes."
Xander,What the hell's going on here?
Willow,You don't know me?
Xander,"(lifts the rifle away from her) Lady, I suggest you find cover.  (starts walking past her)"
Willow,"(gets in front of him) No, wait!"
Willow,Oh!
Xander,What are you?
Willow,"Xander, listen to me. I'm on your side, I swear! Something  crazy is happening. I was dressed as a ghost for Halloween, a-and now I  am a ghost. And you were supposed to be a soldier, and now I, I-I guess  you're a real soldier."
Xander,You expect me to believe that?
Willow,No! No guns! That's still a little kid in there!
Xander,Step out of the way!
Willow,No guns! That's an order!
Willow,We just need to find... (sees her) Buffy!
Willow,Buffy! Are you okay?
Xander,This could be a situation.
Willow,"Buffy, what do we do?"
Willow,"Buffy, are you alright?"
Buffy,What?
Xander,Are you hurt?
Willow,"Buffy, are you hurt?"
Buffy,(sits up) Buffy?
Willow,(to Xander) She's not Buffy.
Xander,Who's Buffy?
Willow,"Oh, this is fun. (to Buffy) What year is this?"
Buffy,"1775, I believe. (confused and hyperventilating) I-I don't  understand. Who are you?"
Willow,We're friends.
Buffy,F-friends of whom? Y-your dress... Everything is strange! How  did I come to be here?
Willow,"Breathe, okay, breathe. You're gonna faint again. (to Xander)  How are we supposed to get through this without the Slayer?"
Xander,What's a Slayer?
Xander,I suggest we get inside before we come across anything...
Buffy,(screaming) A DEMON! A DEMON! (gets behind Xander) A DEMON!
Willow,That's not a demon. It's a car.
Buffy,What does it want?
Xander,Is this woman insane?
Willow,She's never seen a car.
Xander,She's never seen a car?
Willow,She's from the past.
Xander,And you're a ghost.
Willow,Yes! Now let's get inside.
Xander,I just want you to know that I'm taking a lot on faith here.  Where do we go?
Willow,(thinks) Where's the closest... We can go to a friend's.
Xander,All clear!
Willow,"(walks in) Hello? Mrs. Summers? (no response) Good, she's gone."
Buffy,Where are we?
Willow,Your place. Now we just need to...
Willow,Don't open it!
Xander,Could be a civilian.
Willow,Or a mini demon.
Buffy,This... this could be me.
Willow,"It *is* you. Buffy, can't you remember at all?"
Buffy,"No! I, I don't understand any of this! Uh, uh, th... This is  some other girl! (puts the picture back) I would never wear this, that  low apparel, and I don't like this place, and I don't like you, and I  just wanna go home!"
Willow,You *are* home!
Willow,She couldn't've dressed up like Xena?
Willow,Not a civilian!
Xander,Affirmative! (takes aims through the broken portal)
Willow,Hey! What did we say?!
Xander,"Big noise scare monster, remember?"
Willow,Got it.
Xander,Damn it!
Buffy,Surely he'll not desert us!
Willow,(shakes her head) Whatever.
Cordelia,Somebody help me!
Cordelia,Xander! Help me!
Xander,Come inside!
Willow,Cordelia!
Cordelia,Wait a... What's going on?
Willow,"Okay, your name is Cordelia, you're not a cat, you're in high  school, and we're your friends. Well, sort of."
Cordelia,"That's nice, Willow. And you went mental when?"
Willow,You know us?
Cordelia,Yeah. Lucky me. What's with the name game?
Willow,A lot's going on.
Cordelia,"No kidding. I was just attacked by Jo-Jo, the Dog-Faced Boy.  Look at my costume! (shows the torn sleeve) Do you really think that  Partytown's gonna give me my deposit back? Not on the likely."
Xander,Here.
Cordelia,Thanks.
Willow,"Okay. You guys stay here while I get some help. If something  tries to get in, just fight it off."
Buffy,"Well, i-it's not our place to fight. Uh, surely some men will  protect us."
Cordelia,What's that riff?
Willow,"I-it's like amnesia, okay? They don't know who they are. Just  sit tight. (starts to go)"
Cordelia,Who died and made her the boss?
Spike,Well! This is just... neat!
Xander,(to Cordelia) You! Check upstairs. Make sure everything's  locked up.
Buffy,Surely there's somewhere we can go. A safe haven.
Xander,Lady said stay put.
Buffy,You would take orders from a woman? A-are you feeble in some  way?
Xander,"Ma'am, in the Army we have a saying: sit down and shut the..."
Xander,Whoa!
Xander,She must be right. We must have some kind of amnesia.
Buffy,"I don't know what that is, but I'm certain I don't have it. I  bathe quite often!"
Xander,How do you explain this?
Buffy,"I don't! I was brought up a proper lady. I-I wasn't meant to  understand things. I'm just meant to look pretty, and then someone nice  will marry me. Possibly a Baron."
Xander,"This ain't no tea party, princess. Sooner or later you're gonna  have to fight!"
Buffy,Fight these low creatures? (snotty) I'd sooner die. (crosses her  arms)
Xander,Then you'll die.
Angel,"Oh, good! You guys are alright. It's total chaos out there."
Giles,Jeez!
Willow,Hi.
Giles,(calms down a bit) Uh... ah... (speechless) huh...
Angel,"Okay, somebody wanna fill me in?"
Xander,Do you live here?
Angel,"No, and you know that. Buffy, (she jumps) I'm lost here. You...  What's up with your hair?"
Cordelia,"(comes back in) They don't know who they are, everyone's  turned into a monster, it's a whole big thing. (smiles) How are you?"
Cordelia,Do you mind?
Xander,"(to Angel) You take the princess and secure the kitchen.  Catwoman, you're with me."
Buffy,But I don't wanna go with you! I-I like the man with the musket!
Angel,(takes her arm) C'mon.
Buffy,Do you have a musket?
Angel,I didn't leave that open.
Angel,A stake!
Buffy,A what?
Angel,Get me a stake!
Angel,Hurry up!
Angel,"Buffy, no!"
Willow,I don't even know what I'm looking for. Plus I can't turn the  page.
Giles,"Well, alright, l-let's, let's, let's review. (sets the papers on  the table) Um, so everybody became, uh, whatever they were masquerading  as."
Willow,Right. Xander was a soldier and Buffy was an 18th-century girl.
Giles,"(confused) A-and, uh, your, your costume?"
Willow,I'm a ghost!
Giles,"Yes. Um... w, uh, uh, uh, the ghost of what, exactly?"
Willow,"(covers her midriff with her arms) Well, this is nothing. You  should see what Cordelia was wearing. A-a, a unitard with cat things,  like ears and stuff."
Giles,"Good heavens. Uh, sh-sh-she became an actual feline?"
Willow,No! She was the same old Cordelia. Just in a cat costume.
Giles,She didn't change.
Willow,No. Hold on... Partytown. She told us she got her outfit from  Partytown.
Giles,"A-a-and everyone who changed, they, they, they, they acquired  their costumes where?"
Willow,We all got ours at a new place. Ethan's.
Xander,Are you sure she came this way?
Angel,No.
Cordelia,She'll be okay.
Angel,"*Buffy* would be okay. Whoever she is now, she's helpless.  C'mon!"
Spike,"Do you hear that, my friends?"
Spike,"Somewhere out here is the (cut to Buffy running down the alley)  *tenderest* meat you've *ever* tasted, and all *we* have to do is find  her first!"
Larry,"Pretty, pretty!"
Giles,Hello! Anyone home?
Willow,Giles...
Giles,Janus. Roman mythical god.
Willow,What does this mean?
Giles,"Primarily the division of self. Male and female, light and dark."
Ethan,"(appears) Chunky and creamy. Oh, no, sorry, that's peanut  butter."
Giles,"Willow, get out of here, now."
Willow,But...
Giles,Now!
Giles,"Hello, Ethan."
Ethan,"Hello, Ripper."
Cordelia,Buffy! Are you okay?
Cordelia,What's your deal? Take a pill!
Buffy,"He's, he's a vampire!"
Cordelia,"(to Angel) She's got this thing where she thinks...  (exasperated) Uhhh, forget it. (to Buffy) It's okay. Angel is a good  vampire. He would never hurt you."
Buffy,(slowly stands up) Really?
Cordelia,Absolutely. He's our friend.
Xander,"(to Angel) It's strange, but beating up that pirate gave me a  weird sense of closure."
Willow,Guys!
Angel,Willow!
Willow,"Guys, you gotta get inside."
Xander,We need a triage!
Angel,(points the other way) This way! Find an open warehouse.
Xander,"Ladies, we're on the move!"
Ethan,"What? No hug? Aren't you pleased to see your old mate, Rupert?"
Giles,I'm just surprised I didn't guess it was you. This Halloween  stunt stinks of Ethan Rayne.
Ethan,"Yes, it does, doesn't it? Don't wish to blow my own trumpet, but  it's genius. The very embodiment of 'be careful what you wish for'."
Giles,"It's sick, brutal, and it harms the innocent."
Ethan,"Oh, and we all know that you are the champion of innocents and  all things pure and good, Rupert. It's quite a little act you've got  going here, old man."
Giles,It's no act. It's who I am.
Ethan,"Who you are? The Watcher, sniveling, tweed-clad guardian of the  Slayer and her kin? I think not. I know who you are, Rupert, and I know  what you're capable of. (considers) But they don't, do they? They have  no idea where you come from."
Giles,"Break the spell, Ethan. Then leave this place and never come  back."
Ethan,Why should I? What's in the bargain for me?
Giles,You get to live.
Ethan,"Oh, Rupert, you're scaring me."
Angel,Over here!
Xander,Check if there are any other ways in!
Angel,Just stay here.
Cordelia,"Oh, faboo, more clinging."
Xander,GOOOOO!
Ethan,And you said the Ripper was long gone.
Giles,Tell me how to stop the spell.
Ethan,Say 'pretty please'.
Spike,Look at you. Shaking. Terrified. Alone. Lost little lamb.
Spike,I love it.
Angel,Buffy!
Giles,"Now, tell me how to stop the spell."
Ethan,Janus. Break its statue.
Willow,Now that guy you *can* shoot.
Xander,What the...
Kid,I'm scared! I want my mommy!
Buffy,"Hi, honey. I'm home."
Buffy,You know what? It's good to be me.
Xander,"Hey, Buff. Welcome back."
Buffy,"Yeah! You, too."
Cordelia,You guys remember what happened?
Xander,"It was way creepy. It's like I was there, but I couldn't get  out."
Cordelia,"Yeah, I know the feeling. This outfit's totally skintight."
Angel,You okay?
Buffy,Yeah.
Cordelia,"Hello?! It felt like I was talking, my lips were moving  and..."
Xander,"(shakes his head). Give it up, Cordy. You're never gonna get  between those two. Believe me, I know."
Cordelia,"Well, (indicates the kids) I guess you better get them back  to their parents."
Xander,"(looks around) Yeah, everybody seems to... Where's Willow?"
Lyrics,"<I>You got the best of me / And, gee, you took so long / The  things you put me through / Seemed to be so wrong</I>"
Oz,Who is that girl?
Lyrics,<I>You took your...</I>
Buffy,Tada. Just little old 20th-century me.
Angel,Sure you're okay?
Buffy,I'll live.
Angel,"I don't get it, Buffy. Why'd you think I'd like you better  dressed that way?"
Buffy,(sits next to him) I just wanted to be a real girl for once. The  kind of fancy girl you liked when you were my age.
Angel,"(ironically) Oh, ho."
Buffy,What?
Angel,I hated the girls back then. Especially the noble women.
Buffy,(nods) You did.
Angel,"They were just incredibly dull. Simpering morons, the lot of  them. I always wished I could meet someone... exciting. (looks her in  the eyes) Interesting."
Buffy,Really? Interesting how?
Angel,You know how.
Buffy,"Still, I had a really hard day. You should probably tell me."
Angel,(smiles and draws nearer) You're right. I should.
Buffy,(gets closer) Definitely.
Note,Be seeing you...
