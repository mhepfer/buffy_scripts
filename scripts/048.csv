Faith,"(to Buffy, struggling) So, what, you're telling me never?!"
Buffy,"(also struggling) Faith! Really, now is not the time!"
Faith,I'm curious! Never ever?!
Faith,"(to Buffy) Come on, really. All this time, and not even once?"
Buffy,How many times do I have to say it?
Buffy,I have never...
Buffy,...done it...
Buffy,...with Xander!
Buffy,He's just a friend.
Faith,"So? What are friends for? I mean, I'm sorry, (smiles sexily)  it's just, all this sweating-nightly, side-by-side action, and you never  put in for a little after-hours (thrusts her pelvis forward and grunts)?"
Buffy,"(raises her eyebrows) Thanks for the poetry. And, no. I love  Xander. I just don't... *love* Xander. (looks at the ground) Besides, I  think it ruins friendship to do that stuff."
Faith,You think too much. (starts to leave)
Buffy,"(grabs Faith's arm, looking down) Hey. There's one more."
Faith,How do you know?
Buffy,I think too much.
Buffy,(quietly) Okay. Count of three. One...
Buffy,Three.
Faith,"Nicely diverted, B!"
Buffy,"(panting) Diverted? That was me fighting for my life, Miss  Attention Span."
Faith,(sighs and turns to go) This isn't a Tupperware Party. It's a  little hard to plan.
Buffy,(follows) The count of three isn't a plan. It's Sesame Street.
Faith,"(stops and faces Buffy) Hey, they're toast and we're here, so it  couldn't have been too bad, right? (checks her arm) Who were those guys,  anyways?"
Buffy,"I don't know. (sniffs) They didn't seem local. (looks where the  swords were) Look, why don't we grab the weapons. Maybe Giles..."
Trick,Check these out.
Trick,The common term is 'slain'. But I've been seeing this breed  around. Are we expecting any trouble?
Trick,(seriously) I like Marmaduke.
Trick,Nobody can tell Marmaduke what to do. (grins) That's my kinda  dog.
Allan,(smiling eagerly) I like to read Cathy.
Allan,"So, uh, what ab-bout these swords? W-what should we do about  that?"
Allan,"(fidgeting) Well, maybe we should postpone the... the-the  dedication."
Trick,I believe the Honorable Mayor *hates* that idea.
Xander,"Willow, what are these?"
Willow,They're early admission packets.
Xander,"Harvard... Yale... Wesleyan... Some German Polytechnical  Institute whose name I, uh... (tries to read it)  I can't pronounce.  (drops the packets, leans back) Is anyone else intimidated? (looks at  Oz) 'Cause I'm just expecting thin slips of paper with the words 'No  Way' written in crayon."
Oz,They're typing those now.
Xander,(nods) Hmm.
Willow,"(smiling) I'm so overwhelmed! I-I got in! To actual colleges!  And, a-and they're wooing me! They're pitching woo!"
Buffy,(smiles) The wooing stage is always fun.
Willow,"(sighs) But it's weird. Now, rejection I can handle 'cause of  the years of training, but this..."
Xander,"I feel your pain, Will. Like right now, I'm torn between the  fast-growing fields of appliance repair and motel management. Of course,  I'm still waiting to hear back from the, uh, Corndog Emporium, so..."
Buffy,"Well, I think it's great. Early admission. (to Willow) Now  there's nothing standing between you and a brilliant future."
Oz,"Well, if I may suggest, graduate. Gettin' left back: not the thrill  ride you'd expect."
Cordelia,"That's so cute! Planning life as a loser? (Xander glances up  at her) Most people just turn out that way, but you're really taking  charge."
Xander,"The comedy stylings of Miss Cordelia Chase, everyone. (looks up  at her) Who, uh, incidentally, won't be needing a higher education when  she markets her own very successful line of hooker wear."
Cordelia,"Well, Xander, I could dress more like you, but, (in mock  sympathy) oh, my father has a job."
Xander,"I'm not gonna waste the perfect comeback on you now. (points at  her) But don't think I don't have it. (miffed) Oh, yes! Its time will  come!"
Xander,"So, life beyond high school. (fishes for sympathy) Anyone,  please... chime in."
Buffy,I hear it's nice. And a place I'll never go if I don't pass Mrs.  Taggart's chemistry test tomorrow. (looks at Willow)
Willow,"Oh! I can help. Chemistry's easy. It's a lot like witchcraft,  only less newt. So whadaya say? Study jam, my house, tonight?"
Buffy,I'm there.
Buffy,"Oh. I have to go see Giles, report on last night's patrol."
Willow,"Oh, yeah. He said he wanted to talk to you."
Buffy,What about? Is he okay?
Willow,(slightly concerned) He's looked better.
Wesley,"Of course, training procedures have been updated quite a bit  since your day. Much greater emphasis on field work."
Giles,(very bored) Really?
Wesley,"Oh, yes. (walks around to another box) Not all books and theory  nowadays. (reaches in for some books) I have, in fact, faced two  vampires myself. Under controlled circumstances, of course."
Giles,"(uncrosses his arms) Well, no danger of finding those here."
Wesley,(looks up) Vampires?
Giles,"Controlled circumstances. (sees Buffy enter) Hello, Buffy."
Wesley,Well... (steps to the head of the table) Hello. (smiles smugly)
Buffy,(to Giles) New Watcher?
Giles,New Watcher.
Wesley,Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.
Wesley,It's very nice to meet you.
Buffy,Is he evil?
Wesley,(perplexed) Evil?
Buffy,The last one was evil.
Wesley,"(thoughtfully) Oh, yes. Gwendolyn Post. We all heard. No. Mr.  Giles has checked my credentials rather thoroughly and phoned the  Council, but I'm glad to see you're on the ball as well. (takes a  secretive step toward her) A good Slayer is a cautious Slayer. (steps  back)"
Buffy,(to Giles) Is he evil?
Giles,Not in the strictest sense.
Wesley,"Well, I'm glad that's cleared up. (walks around the table) As  I'm sure none of us is anxious to waste any time on pleasantries, (picks  up his Watcher diary) why don't you tell me everything about last  night's patrol. (flips to a blank page)"
Buffy,Vampires.
Wesley,(inquiringly) Yes?
Buffy,Killed 'em.
Wesley,(fishing for details) Anything else you can tell me?
Buffy,Uh... (thinks) One of them had swords. I don't think he was with  the other two.
Wesley,(something clicks) Swords?
Wesley,Swords...
Wesley,"One long, one short?"
Buffy,"Mmm. Both pointy. (to Giles) With, like, jewels and things."
Giles,Sounds familiar.
Wesley,(comes back with the book) It should.
Giles,El Eliminati. Fifteenth Century...
Wesley,"(interrupts) Fifteenth Century duelist cult, deadly in their  day. Their numbers dwindled in later centuries due to an increase in  anti-vampire activity and a lot of pointless dueling."
Wesley,"They eventually became the acolytes of a demon called  Balthazar, who brought them to the New World, specifically here."
Giles,"(closes the book, hands it back) You seem to know a lot about  them."
Wesley,I didn't get this job because of my looks. (goes back to his  box)
Buffy,"I really, really believe that. (nods)"
Wesley,(looks at her snidely) I've researched this town's history  extensively.
Giles,So why have we not seen them before this?
Wesley,"(comes back) They were driven out a hundred years ago. Happily,  Balthazar was killed. I don't know by whom."
Buffy,And they're back 'cause...?
Wesley,"Balthazar had an amulet purported to give him strength. When he  was killed, it was taken by a wealthy landowner named... (sees their  looks) I don't want to bore you with the details."
Buffy,A little bit late.
Wesley,"...named Gleaves. It was buried with him, and I believe the few  remaining Eliminati are probably looking for it. For sentimental value."
Giles,"A-and you don't think that this, uh, amulet poses any threat?"
Wesley,"(steps back to his box) Oh, no, not at all. Nonetheless, we may  as well keep it from them. Buffy, you will go to the Gleaves family  crypt tonight and fetch the amulet. (reaches in)"
Buffy,I will?
Wesley,(pauses) Are you not used to being given orders?
Buffy,"Whenever Giles sends me on a mission, he always says 'please'.  And afterwards I get a cookie."
Wesley,(comes back) I don't feel we're getting off on quite the right  foot.
Wesley,Ah. This is perhaps Faith.
Faith,New Watcher?
Faith,(snickers) Screw that.
Buffy,"(to Giles) Now, why didn't *I* just say that?"
Giles,"(gently) Uh, Buffy, would you..."
Buffy,I'll see if I can get her back. (slips off of the table and  walks out) Don't say anything terribly interesting while I'm gone.
Wesley,They'll get used to me.
Buffy,"Faith, wait. Look, I know this new guy's a dork, but... (pauses)  Well, I have nothing to follow that. He's pretty much just a dork."
Faith,You're actually gonna take orders from him?
Buffy,That's the job. What else can we do?
Faith,"Whatever we want. We're Slayers, girlfriend, the Chosen Two. Why  should we let *him* take all the fun out of it?"
Buffy,"Oh, that would be tragic, taking the fun out of slaying,  stabbing, beheading."
Faith,"Oh, like you don't dig it."
Buffy,(shrugs) I don't.
Faith,"You're a liar. I've *seen* you. Tell me staking a vamp doesn't  get you a little bit juiced. Come on, say it."
Faith,(laughs) You can't fool me. The look in your eyes right after a  kill? You just get hungry for more.
Buffy,(shakes her head) You're way off base.
Faith,"Tell me that if you don't get in a good slaying, after a while,  you just start itching for some vamp to show up so you can give him a  good (grunts and punches)!"
Buffy,Again with the grunting. You realize I'm not comfortable with  this.
Faith,"Hey, slaying's what we were built for. If you're not enjoying  it, you're doing something wrong. (starts to leave)"
Buffy,(sighs) What about the assignment?
Faith,"(looks back) Tell you what: (points) you do the homework, and  I'll copy yours. (grins and goes)"
Buffy,Strike one. No amulet there.
Buffy,Game over.
Buffy,Faith!
Faith,"What are you doing, hiding in there?"
Buffy,Looking for the amulet. Wasn't counting on the Special Guest  Stars. Six against one. (gestures at the coffin) Hence the hiding.
Faith,"Well, it's six against two now, so come on."
Buffy,Wait. Stop. Think!
Faith,"(stops, defiantly) No, no, no! (starts again)"
Buffy,"(chases her) It's a manhole. Tight space, no escape, six against  two, not unlike three against one."
Faith,"And there might be more, (grabs Buffy's arm) so come on. (lets  go)"
Buffy,You're just gonna go down there. That's your plan.
Faith,"Who said I had a plan? I don't know how many's down there, but I  wanna find out. And I'll know when I land. If you don't come in after  me, (shrugs and smiles) I might die!"
Wesley,"These are all the diaries, then? Yours included?"
Giles,(in a worried tone) That's everything. Knock yourself out.  Please?
Wesley,"(flips through Giles' diary) Oh, yes! Here's your first entry.  'Slayer is willful and insolent.' (smirks) That would be our girl,  wouldn't it?"
Giles,"(continues pacing, takes off his glasses) Well, you have to get  to know her."
Wesley,"Mm. (reads) 'Her abuse of the English language is such that I  understand only every other sentence.' (looks up) Oh, this is going to  make fascinating reading."
Giles,(checks his watch) She should be back by now.
Wesley,(checks his watch) Not to fret. (reaches for a mint) My mission  scenario has her back in one minute. (pops the mint) Shouldn't be any  trouble.
Buffy,We're surrounded!
Faith,"You noticed that, too?!"
Faith,Lemme go!
Vincent,Let's settle this honorably.
Vincent,"Well, then, let's just settle it."
Faith,Buffy! (struggles with her assailant) You son of a bitch!
Buffy,I hate it when they drown me.
Faith,B! Gotta go!
Buffy,We came for the amulet.
Faith,(breathing heavily) Tell me you don't get off on this!
Buffy,(smiles at the amulet) It didn't suck.
Wesley,"Well... Looks authentic enough. (looks up) Of course, there are  tests to be made before actual verification."
Buffy,How about verifying that your 'nearly extinct' cult was out in  magnum force last night? Faith and I got into a serious party situation.
Giles,Are you alright?
Buffy,"I had to lather, rinse, and repeat about five million times to  get the sewer out of my hair, but otherwise, I'm of the good. Thank you  for asking."
Wesley,"Perhaps there were a few more than we'd anticipated, but I'd  expect you to be ready for anything. (looks her in the eye) Remember the  three key words for any Slayer: preparation... preparation...  preparation."
Buffy,That's one word three times.
Buffy,"I have a chem test. So sad that I'm actually happy about that.  (starts out) Giles, we need to talk."
Wesley,"(stands up pompously) Buffy... (she stops, but doesn't face  him) I must ask you to remember that I am your Watcher. (she faces him)  From now on, anything you have to say about slaying you will say to me.  The only thing you need discuss with Mr. Giles is overdue book fees.  Understood?"
Buffy,(turns to Giles) We'll talk.
Giles,Of course.
Wesley,(to Giles) You're not helping.
Giles,(dripping with sarcasm) No. I feel just sick about it.
Buffy,It was intense. It was like I just... let go and became this  force. I just didn't care anymore.
Willow,"Yeah, I know what that's like."
Buffy,I don't think you can! It's kind of a Slayer thing. I don't even  think I'm explaining it well.
Xander,"You're explaining it a lot, though."
Buffy,"You see, the thing was, Faith knew I didn't even wanna go down  there..."
Buffy,"Okay, so the best part..."
Willow,"(interrupts, concerned) Buffy. Test? You know. Remember? The  thing you didn't come over to study for?"
Buffy,(seems to get it) Right. Got it.
Buffy,"(smiles) Sorry. Okay, so we're down there, in the sewers, and  Faith (Xander's eye twitches) got three of them on her at once..."
Xander,"Hey! Whoa! Can we resume Buffy's 'Ode to Faith' later, like  when I'm not actively multiple-choicing?"
Buffy,(realizes) How come your eye twitches every time I say Faith's  name?
Xander,"(twitches his eye) (defensively) What? (chuckles) No, it  doesn't."
Buffy,Faith.
Xander,"Cut it out! We got a test to take, okay? And I'm highly  caffeinated, and I'm trying to concentrate. Some of us actually care  about school. You know."
Faith,"(smiles) Hey, girlfriend. (looks around) Bad time?"
Willow,"No, sh-she can't!"
Willow,Y-you can't! Can you?
Buffy,What's up?
Faith,Vampires.
Buffy,"Uh, Faith, unless there's a total eclipse in the next five  minutes, it's daylight."
Faith,"Good for us, bad for them. Found a nest."
Buffy,"(smiles, suddenly comprehending) Has potential."
Faith,"Rise and shine, people."
Buffy,It's your wake-up call.
Lyrics,<I>She burns friends like a piece of wood</I>
Buffy,"Hey! You're not leaving, are you?"
Lyrics,<I>And she's jealous of me because she never could</I>
Angel,(glances over at Faith and the boys) I saw you making friends.
Buffy,(glances dismissingly) Them?
Lyrics,<I>Hold herself up without a spine</I>
Buffy,"(faces him, smiling) Boys! I like you."
Lyrics,<I>And she'll look me up when she's doing fine</I>
Buffy,"(coyly teasing) What's the matter? You're not afraid of little  me, are ya?"
Angel,(seriously) We better sit down. Come on.
Buffy,I can sense this is a business trip.
Buffy,(flippantly) What's the what?
Angel,Balthazar.
Buffy,(snuggles close to him) Dead demon.
Angel,Not as dead as you think.
Angel,Word on the street puts him in the packing warehouse on  Devereau. He's looking for...
Buffy,His amulet. It's supposed to restore his strength.
Angel,"From what I'm hearing, that's not something we'd like to see  happen."
Buffy,No problem. We got the amulet.
Angel,"I know. I spoke to Giles, but he said you gave it to someone."
Wesley,(points accusingly) Ah. There you are.
Buffy,(mockingly) Ah. Speak of the really annoying person.
Wesley,"(looks around) You're certainly giving me a run for my money.  (sits next to her, whispers) I think we ought to establish that if  you're going to go out slaying, you leave me a number where I can  contact you."
Angel,Where's the amulet?
Wesley,Who are you?
Angel,A friend. Do you have it?
Wesley,(smugly) It's somewhere safe.
Wesley,How did you know?
Buffy,It pooches your jacket.
Wesley,"(protests) Now, hang on a minute..."
Angel,(holds it up) Walking around with this thing is like wearing a  target.
Buffy,You're gonna put it somewhere safe (to Wesley) that's actually  safe?
Angel,(stands up) Yeah. I'll do it now.
Buffy,(stands also) I'll do some recon on Balthazar.
Wesley,(joins them in standing) (incredulously) If I may... Balthazar  is dead. Am I the only one that remembers that?
Angel,Be careful.
Buffy,You know me.
Angel,(sternly) I mean it.
Wesley,What's going on?
Faith,Call me!
Balthazar,Let me tell you what I see.
Balthazar,"I see fear... and remorse... and the pitiful look of faces  that cry out for mercy! But what I *don't* see is what I *want* to see,  AND THAT'S... MY... AMULET!"
Vampire,"Lord Balthazar, we found it! We had it! But the Slayers..."
Balthazar,Already I'm bored.
Balthazar,Vincent... Come here.
Balthazar,Closer.
Balthazar,Closer.
Balthazar,Let me tell you... what I want to see.
Buffy,"Okay, we got ten, maybe twelve bad guys and one big demon in  desperate need of a Stairmaster."
Faith,"I say we take 'em all, hard and fast and now."
Buffy,We need a little more firepower than none. We should head back  to the library.
Faith,"Well, I guess Jacuzzi Boy isn't going anywhere. (looks around) I  just... wish we had..."
Faith,Ah. That is too good.
Faith,Ah. Score.
Buffy,Think they're insured?
Faith,"Strangely, not my priority. (checks the trigger mechanism) When  are ya gonna get this, B? Life for a Slayer is very simple: (walks to a  vertical case) want... (breaks it) take... (reaches in for a set of nun- chucks) have. (stuffs them into her pants)"
Buffy,Want... (walks to the case) take... (stops in front of it) have.
Buffy,I'm gettin' it.
Officer,Drop the weapons and get down on the ground! Now!
Officer,"I said drop the weapons, or I fire."
Officer,Now spread 'em.
Faith,(haughtily) You wish.
Officer,Hands in the air where I can see 'em. Slow!
Officer,Good. (to his partner) Now cuff 'em.
Faith,"(to Buffy, smiling sexily) I like him. He's butch."
Officer,That's some artillery you two were puttin' together. You with  one of them girl gangs?
Faith,(sarcastically) Yeah. We're the Slayers.
Faith,(quietly to Buffy) You wanna get outta here?
Faith,(impatiently) We can't save the world in jail.
Faith,"(quietly) One, two..."
Buffy,(looking at the officers) We should call an ambulance.
Faith,"Five people already have, the racket we made, and they're fine."
Faith,Come on. Let's get outta here.
Faith,COME ON!
Joyce,Admit it.
Joyce,Some days don't you wanna just wake up and say to Hell with the  diet? Wanna make waffles? Big Saturday brunch?
Buffy,"No, thanks. I'm not really that hungry. (turns the page)"
Joyce,"So, what did you and Faith do last night?"
Buffy,Nothing. Uh... (smiles thinly) Nothing really important.
Joyce,(gets a coffee mug) Don't worry. (grabs the coffee pot) I'm not  gonna meddle in your slaying. (pours a cup) Just as long as you're  careful.
Buffy,(engrossed in reading) I am.
Joyce,You sure about those waffles?
Buffy,"Yeah. But if you want them, I can help you make them."
Joyce,"No. (sighs) They only don't have calories if I make them for  you. (Buffy doesn't get it) Mom logic. You, uh, done with the paper?"
Buffy,(gets up) Yeah. (leaves the kitchen)
Joyce,(opens the paper) Let's see what's happening in Sunnydale.
Vincent,"In the name of Lord Balthazar, DIE!"
Trick,"Why do they always gotta be using swords? (picks it up, tosses  it to Allan) It's called an Uzi, ya chump! Could have saved your ass  right about now."
Allan,"(scared and nervous) Sir, I... I had no idea. I-I..."
Trick,"He wakes up, he's just gonna try and kill you again."
Balthazar,"Vincent made a noble effort. Man to man, as befits a true  warrior. (wheezes) He had courage... He had honor... AND I HAVE *JACK*  TO SHOW FOR IT! (calms a bit) It's been a hundred years since my enemy  crippled me. Now ultimate power is within his grasp. And I shall *not*  let it be! Forget about honor! Forget about everything! But getting my  amulet! Bring the Watchers to me! Find the Slayers and kill them! Kill  everything that gets in your way! GOOOOO! GOOOOO!"
Buffy,Mmm.
Willow,You like it?
Buffy,It smells good. What is it?
Willow,(smiling proudly) Just a little something we witches like to  call a protection spell.
Buffy,"Good deal, protection. (sniffs) I'm surprised, though, 'cause  usually spell stuff's more..."
Willow,"Stinky. Yeah. That's why I added lavender. Give me time, and I  may be the first wicca to do all my conjuring in pine fresh scent. So  what's the plan?"
Willow,"For tonight's slayage. We're going, aren't we?"
Buffy,(wanting to avoid the subject) Yeah.
Willow,(knowing there's more) Great!
Buffy,(realizes she can't hide it) But... there's a 'but'. And that's  'but you shouldn't come... tonight.' Is that cool?
Willow,"(slightly hurt) Well, sure. Makes sense. You know... You'll be  facing big, hairy danger."
Buffy,"(tries to justify it) Uh, b-biggest and very hairy."
Willow,(fishes for more information) You'll be risking your life.
Buffy,Right. And why risk yours?
Willow,"(glances down, then back up) Because I'm your friend?"
Buffy,"I know, Will, and that's exactly why I don't want you going.  It's, it's too dangerous."
Willow,"(protests) But I-I've done this sort of thing before! Like, a  million times, and I can totally handle myself. Besides, (holds up her  own felt pouch) minty fresh protection. So?"
Faith,"Ready? Time to motor. Hey, Willow."
Willow,(unenthused) Hi. (faces Buffy) Uh...
Buffy,"(stands up, apologetic) I really should... But we'll hang out  later, right?"
Willow,"(trying to hide how hurt she is) Yeah. You, you go ahead. I'll  just get my stuff."
Willow,Stupid...
Faith,You're quiet tonight.
Buffy,I just wanna get this done.
Faith,Yeah. (smiling) I'm dying to test out the longbow. I think it  might be my new thing.
Buffy,I can't believe you went back for that stuff.
Faith,"Hey, how do you feel about getting some ribs? You know, after  we're done?"
Wesley,I didn't say you had emotional problems. (turns to Giles) I  said you had *an* emotional problem. (condescendingly) It's quite  different.
Giles,"(enunciating clearly) My 'attachment' to the Slayer is not a  problem. In point of fact, it's been a very..."
Wesley,(interrupts) The way you've handled this assignment is  something of an embarrassment to the council.
Giles,"(miffed) If you want to criticize my methods, fine. But you can  keep your snide remarks to yourself. And while you're at it, don't  criticize my methods. (puts on his glasses)"
Wesley,"The fact is, you're no longer qualified to act as Watcher.  (paces behind Giles, condescendingly) It's not your fault. You've done  well. It's simply time for somebody else to take the field. (turns  around)"
Giles,Now's a good time to start.
Faith,(to herself) Screw it!
Faith,I think we've got more comin'!
Buffy,We're never gonna make it to the warehouse.
Faith,"If they keep coming one at a time, we got a shot."
Buffy,"FAITH, NO!"
Buffy,Don't move!
Faith,(shocked) I didn't... I didn't know. I didn't know.
Buffy,"(to Faith behind her) We need to call 911, NOW!"
Buffy,"(to Allan) Don't move, i-it's okay..."
Buffy,"(to Faith) I-I need, I need something to stop the..."
Faith,We gotta go!
Faith,"Come on, we gotta go!"
Faith,Come on.
Buffy,Angel!
Angel,"Buffy, I've been looking for you."
Angel,Your hand.
Buffy,It's okay.
Angel,I've just been to the warehouse. I was waiting for you. They got  Giles.
Balthazar,The front! The front! Moisten the front!
Wesley,"(very nervous) Oh, God! (looks around desperately) Oh, God!"
Giles,"(calmly) It doesn't seem too promising, does it?"
Wesley,"(trying not to panic) Stay calm, Mr. Giles. We have to stay  calm."
Giles,"(brimming over with sarcasm) Well, thank God you're here. I was  planning to panic."
Wesley,(looks at Balthazar) What *is* that thing?
Giles,"That would be your demon. You know, the dead one?"
Wesley,There's no need to get snippy.
Balthazar,Bring them closer.
Balthazar,You know what I want.
Giles,"If it's for me to scrub those hard-to-reach areas, I'd like to  request you kill me now."
Giles,Ow.
Wesley,(beginning to panic) Are you out of your mind? This is hardly  the time for games!
Giles,Why not? They're going to torture us to death anyway.
Balthazar,(snickers happily) You're not wrong about that. (wheezes)
Wesley,"Now, hold on. We-we-we can deal with this rationally. We have  something you want. You have something we want."
Balthazar,Hmm... A trade. Intriguing. (considers) No. Wait. Boring.  Pull off his kneecaps!
Wesley,"(horrified) NOOO! No, no, no! (they let go, he caves) The  Slayer g-gave it to someone. A tall man, a friend... a friend of hers. I  can tell you everything."
Giles,"(under his breath) Quiet, you twerp! They'll kill us both."
Wesley,(panicked) But I'd like to have my kneecaps.
Balthazar,You will tell us everything!
Wesley,Yes! Sir.
Balthazar,What is this friend's name?
Wesley,(at a loss) I didn't actually catch it.
Giles,"(tries to fake him out) Look, um, tell you what, let Captain  Courageous here go, and I'll tell you what you need to know. How's that  deal?"
Balthazar,"THERE IS ONE DEAL! YOU WILL DIE QUICKLY, OR YOU WILL DIE  SLOWLY! THE MAN WHO HAS MY AMULET! WHAT IS HIS NAAAME?!"
Angel,His name is Angel.
Balthazar,(flailing his arms in a tantrum) Un... (sputters)  Unacceptable!
Balthazar,(very displeased) UNACCEPTABLE!
Wesley,Giles!
Giles,DOWN!
Balthazar,(weak and wheezing) Slayer! You think you've won. (chuckles  and wheezes) When he rises... you'll wish I'd killed you all.
Translation,"Our mother of darkness, I summon thee. Curse now your  dangerous accursed son and protect him into the new age!"
Trick,(wide-eyed) Did it work?
Trick,You sure?
Buffy,"Faith, it's me."
Buffy,Hey.
Faith,Hey.
Buffy,"So, I, uh... (sees Faith scrubbing) How are ya doin'?"
Faith,(still scrubbing) I'm alright. You know me.
Buffy,"Faith, we need to talk about what we're gonna do."
Faith,(looks at Buffy) There's nothing to talk about. I was doing my  job.
Buffy,Being a Slayer is not the same as being a killer.
Buffy,"Faith, please don't shut me out here. Look, sooner or later,  we're both gonna have to deal."
Faith,(looks the shirt over) Wrong.
Buffy,We can help each other.
Faith,I don't need it.
Buffy,"Yeah? Who's wrong now? Faith, you can shut off all the emotions  that you want. But eventually, they're gonna find a body."
Faith,"(faces Buffy) Okay, this is the last time we're gonna have this  conversation, and we're not even having it now, you understand me? There  *is* no body. I took it, weighted it, and dumped it. The body doesn't  exist. (turns away)"
Buffy,(shocked) Getting rid of the evidence doesn't make the problem  go away.
Faith,(faces Buffy) It does for me.
Buffy,"(very concerned) Faith, you don't get it. You *killed* a man."
Faith,"No, *you* don't get it. (smiles daringly) I don't care!"
