GILES,"<br>    Power to the people? You sound like a child of the seventies."
KENNEDY,"<br>    What we're saying is we're in charge in charge of ourselves."
FAITH,"<br>    OK, you guys, let's just try not to freak out."
KENNEDY,"<br>    All I'm saying is now that Buffy's not here, we finally have some say in how     and when we lose our necks."
ROBIN,"<br>    Maybe you don't have to be so blunt about (gestures a cutting motion with     his hand in front of his neck) the losing of the necks bit."
ANYA,"<br>    (emphatically) No, let the girl speak the truth. We're all on death's door     repeatedly ringing the doorbell like maniacal girl scouts trying to make quota."
XANDER,"<br>    (shifts in his seat) You know, I'm thinking that everyone here shouldn't have     a say."
GILES,"<br>    We just have to find some way of having constructive dialogue without going     completely mad."
AMANDA,"<br>    Do you know the parliamentary procedure? 'Cause that's a convenient way of     organizing&#151;"
KENNEDY,"<br>    I just wonder if those of us who have been here longer should have more of     a say."
ROBIN,"<br>    Maybe we should break down into small groups so it wouldn't be so chaotic.     Faith, what do you think?"
AMANDA,"<br>    When I was involved with the Model UN, we found the parliamentary procedure     to be a total lifesaver. For example, once when I was Uruguay&#151;anyway,     one of those &quot;U&quot; countries&#151;it was like here, only we had this     system which allowed us to organize our conversation."
GILES,"<br>    (to Dawn) She's going to be fine. Really, it's for the best."
DAWN,"<br>    (to Giles) Yeah? Then why do I feel like this?"
FAITH,"<br>    (to the group) I hear what you're saying, but&#151;"
KENNEDY,"<br>    Shouldn't we get down to business?"
WILLOW,"<br>    (rolls her eyes) You guys, I think we're wasting time arguing about how to     argue."
AMANDA,"<br>    Well, why don't we&#151;?"
VI,"<br>    (to Amanda) Please do not mention parliamentary procedure."
CARIDAD,"<br>    (under her breath) I second that."
FAITH,"<br>    Everyone, listen to me. Chill. All right? It's been a long night, and I don't     know about you, but I'm wiped. Maybe we should catch some sleep and figure     all this out in the morning."
KENNEDY,"<br>    Do we really have time to waste?"
FAITH,"<br>    Look, I understand you guys are wicked stressed. Frankly, our situation blows.     We've got to stay cool. That's the only way we're going to get through this.     Can everyone handle that?"
VI,"<br>    Yeah...yeah...we'll get some rest and then tomorrow, things won't seem so&#151;"
CARIDAD,"<br>    The lights went out?"
AMANDA,"<br>    I'll get some candles... if we have candles."
KENNEDY,"<br>    I'll check the fuse box."
FAITH,"<br>    (looking out the window) Don't bother. All the lights on the whole street     just went out."
KENNEDY,"<br>    Which means?"
FAITH,"<br>    (looking at the group) That the people from the power company have got the     hell out of Sunnydale."

FAITH,"<br>    I'm saying we think about getting us a Bringer and making it talk. Find out     info on the first and Caleb that way."
ROBIN,"<br>    How do you think we should catch one if they don't want to be found?"
KENNEDY,"<br>    OK, I'm not sure this is such a good idea. Why try and get information when     we already know about the seal? Why don't we send a team to the high school?     Do some recon and&#151;"

I'm not the one who's been on your asses all this time, but     I'm not one of you anymore, either. I'm your leader, which means I go first,     and I make the rules, and the rest of you follow after me.
