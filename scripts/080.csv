BUFFY,I've been going out a lot.
GILES,Patrolling?
BUFFY,Hunting.
GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on BTVS...
BUFFY VOICEOVER,That's ... what Dracula called it. And he was right.
BUFFY,He understood my power better than I do. He saw darkness in it.
BUFFY,"I need to know more. About where I come from, about the other slayers. I need you to be my Watcher again."
XANDER,"Dammit! You know what? I'm sick of this crap. I'm sick of being the guy who eats insects and gets the funny syphilis. As of this moment, it's over. I'm finished being everybody's butt-monkey!"
BUFFY VOICEOVER,What are you *doing* here?
JOYCE,"Buffy? If you're going out, why don't you take your sister?"
Buffy and Dawn (in unison),Mom!
GILES VOICEOVER,There is nothing but you.
GILES VOICEOVER,"You are the center. And within you, there is the core of your being ... of what you are."
GILES,Find it ... breathe into it.
GILES VOICEOVER,Focus inward. Let the world fall away ... fall away ... fall away....
DAWN,Can we go now?
DAWN VOICEOVER,"Nobody knows who I am. Not the real me. It's like, nobody cares enough to find out. I mean, does anyone ever ask *me* what I want to do with my life? Or what my opinion is on stuff? Or what restaurant to order in from?"
DAWN VOICEOVER,No. Underline. Exclamation point.
DAWN VOICEOVER,"Exclamation point, exclamation point. (pause) No one understands. No one has an older sister who's a slayer."
DAWN VOICEOVER,People wouldn't be so crazy about her if they had to live in the same house with her every single day. Everybody cares what she thinks. Just 'cause she can do backflips and stuff.
DAWN VOICEOVER,Like that's *such* a crucial job skill in the real world.
DAWN VOICEOVER,"Plus Mom lets her get away with everything. ""Your sister's saving the world."""
DAWN VOICEOVER,*I* could so save the world if somebody handed me super powers...
DAWN VOICEOVER,"...but I'd think of a cool name and wear a mask to protect my loved ones, which Buffy doesn't even."
DAWN VOICEOVER,"If this town wasn't so lame everyone would completely know what she does. And then I bet they wouldn't even be that impressed, because like, killing things with wood? Oh, scary vampires, they die from a splinter."
JOYCE,"So Buffy, what are your plans today?"
BUFFY,"Oh, actually, Giles and I are gonna go to the magic shop for supplies for my new and improved training sessions."
JOYCE,"Oh, that's great."
BUFFY,"(walking to sink, then to fridge) Oh, yeah, I'm actually-"
JOYCE,(interrupts) You can take Dawn shopping for back to school supplies.
BUFFY,What??
DAWN,"Mom, I-I thought you were taking me."
JOYCE,"Well, honey, I've got the Gurion showing tonight, and there's so much to do to get the gallery ready. (Turns to leave kitchen.)"
BUFFY,"No, but, see, Mom --"
BUFFY,That doesn't really work for me. We're just going to the magic shop. No school supplies there.
DAWN,"Yeah, Mom, I'm not going to Hogwarts. (She giggles at her own joke till she notices Buffy looking annoyed and confused.) Geez, crack a book sometime."
JOYCE,"Look, I'm sure Giles doesn't mind dropping you and your sister off at the mall afterwards."
BUFFY,"Actually, he does mind. This is supposed to be quality Watcher/slayer time. I told you, she completely ruined my training yesterday."
DAWN,Did not!
BUFFY,"Oh, you know you did too."
JOYCE,"Buffy. I realize the importance of your new slayer thing, but-"
JOYCE,-I could really use your help.
RILEY,"Morning, Mrs. Summers. You look great."
JOYCE,"Oh, thank you, Riley. (Exits)"
BUFFY,Suck up.
RILEY,What? It's a nice outfit.
BUFFY,Mm-hmm.
RILEY,"Besides, ""I'm here to violate your firstborn"" never goes over with parents. Not sure why."
DAWN VOICEOVER,"Riley, my sister's boyfriend, is *so* into her. They're always kissing ... and groping. I bet they have sex!"
RILEY,"Hey, kid."
DAWN,I'm not a kid.
BUFFY,"Well, this is a surprise of the nicest kind."
RILEY,Now it's my turn to be surprised. I thought we had plans today.
BUFFY,Plans? We planned plans?
RILEY,"Well, you said, uh, ""come over tomorrow and we'll hang,"" and then I said, ""OK."" Not the invasion of Normandy, but still a plan."
BUFFY,Right.
RILEY,"(studying her expression) We're not hangin' today, are we?"
BUFFY,Giles is on his way to pick me up.
RILEY,"Oh, slayer training."
BUFFY,"Slayer shopping, actually, but equally as important."
RILEY,"I have no doubt. Okay, well, we'll hook up later. (Starts to get up)"
BUFFY,Are you mad at me?
RILEY,"Oh, no, not at all. I'm plotting your death, but in a happy way. (Smiles)"
BUFFY,Good.
RILEY,"Look, Buffy, I know what this means to you. I think it's great that you've got this new mission. I'll see you tonight."
RILEY,"Bye. (calling) See ya, kid!"
DAWN,(OS) I'm not a kid!
GILES,"Well, I sympathize with you, Buffy, I truly do. But I'm certain that Riley understands better than anyone else the importance of training. You can't allow personal concerns to distract you from- (Dawn reaches between them to change the radio station) Dawn, will you stop fiddling with the radio and sit down?"
DAWN VOICEOVER,I don't think Buffy's Watcher likes me too much.
DAWN VOICEOVER,"I think it's 'cause he's just so ... old. I'm not sure how old he is, but I heard him use the word ""newfangled"" one time. So he's gotta be pretty far gone."
BUFFY,"(studying a piece of paper) There's a lot of books on this list. Any of them come on tape? You know, read by George Clooney or someone cute like that?"
GILES,"You're entering a new realm here, Buffy. One for which I myself am not entirely prepared. Are you ready for this commitment?"
BUFFY,"I'm just kidding! Hey, this Betty's ready. Color me committed."
GILES,Blast!
BUFFY,"You put it in neutral again, huh?"
GILES,"I'm just not used to this automatic transmission. I-I loathe this sitting here, not contributing."
GILES,"No, i-it's not working out."
BUFFY,"Giles, are you breaking up with your car?"
GILES,"Well, it did seduce me, all red and sporty!"
BUFFY,Little two-door tramp.
GILES,"I-I-I don't know, I just - I was so at loose ends, I-I found myself searching for ... some way of feeling more..."
BUFFY,Shallow?
GILES,"Perhaps, as I am to act as your Watcher again, a modicum of respect might be in order."
BUFFY,Do I have to?
GILES,"I'm serious, Buffy, there's going to be far less time for the sort of flighty, frivolous-"
DAWN,"(pointing) Hey, there's Willow and Tara!"
GILES,"Ooh, they haven't seen my new car."
WILLOW,"Hey Giles, sharp wheels!"
TARA,The rest of the car's nice too.
GILES,Handles like a dream.
BUFFY,Where are you guys heading?
WILLOW,Magic shop. I have some charms on back order.
DAWN,"(smiling) Willow, hi."
WILLOW,Hey Dawny! (They hug) How's my favorite chess partner? Still leading with your knight?
DAWN VOICEOVER,Willow's the awesomest person.
DAWN VOICEOVER,She's the only one I know who likes school as much as me.
DAWN VOICEOVER,Even her friends are cool!
TARA,Hey Dawn.
DAWN VOICEOVER,"Like Tara. (Cut back to Dawn in the bedroom) She and Willow are both witches. They do spells and stuff, which is so much cooler than slaying. I told Mom one time I wished they'd teach me some of the things they do together. A-and then she got really quiet and made me go upstairs. (She pauses in her writing and looks puzzled.) Huh. I guess her generation isn't cool with witchcraft."
BUFFY,So Giles and I worked out a whole schedule around school. A block of time every day just to focus on my new slayer training.
WILLOW,"That's a work ethic! Buffy, you're developing a work ethic."
BUFFY,"Oh, no. Do they make an ointment for that?"
WILLOW,"People gotta respect a solid work ethic. Look at you, motivated Buffy. Eager to soak up learning. Oh, you and I are gonna have so much fun this semester."
BUFFY,"(stops walking, and so do the rest of them) Yeah, that reminds me. With the whole new training schedule, I kinda had to drop a class."
WILLOW,That's understandable. Your slayer studies are way more important.
BUFFY,So I won't be taking drama with you.
WILLOW,"What? You have to, you promised!"
BUFFY,"Well, I know, but Giles said that it just was- (gesturing to Giles who's behind her, looking in the opposite direction)"
WILLOW,The hell with Giles. (Giles turns in surprise)
GILES,"I can hear you, Willow."
WILLOW,"Drama is just Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. You can blow off training Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, can't you?"
BUFFY,"What happened to ""people gotta respect a work ethic""?"
WILLOW,"Other people, not me! There's a whole best friend loophole."
TARA,(calling to them) Shop's kinda dark. Maybe it's closed.
GILES,That's odd.
BUFFY,"Well, I think ""odd"" just got upped to ""bad."""
GILES,(calling) Hello? Anyone here?
TARA,Mr. Bogarty?
TARA,The owner. I-I come in here a lot.
WILLOW,"Well, maybe this happened ... really late at night when nobody was..."
BUFFY,Will?
WILLOW,"I'm fine, I - I just tripped over..."
WILLOW,Mr. Bogarty.
DAWN,"(behind Buffy and Giles) Wha-what is it, is he okay?"
BUFFY,"It's nothing you need to see, Dawn, go wait outside."
DAWN,I don't wanna wait outside!
BUFFY,Dawn!
DAWN,"Ow, that hurt! (Buffy pushes her out the door onto the street) You're hurting me. I'm telling."
BUFFY,"Look, I don't have time for this. Just do as I say and wait."
BUFFY,Here.
GUY,Whatcha doin'?
GUY,What are you doing here? You can't loiter. There's no loitering.
GUY,"That's why I'm a cat. Quiet. See, cat's in the cupboard (making cat-scratching gestures with his hands) but they find you there anyway, and it hurts."
GUY,"(sobbing) Please, make it stop. (in a different tone) Shut up, shut up, they'll hear you!"
DAWN,(tries to call out) Buff- (Shrieks as the guy puts his finger on her lips)
GUY,I know you. Curds and whey. (Dawn looks shocked) I know what you are. (slowly and ominously) You ... don't ... belong ... here.
TARA,Dawn?
TARA,Dawn?
TARA,Dawn. You okay?
DAWN,Is ... Is that guy dead in there?
TARA,Yeah.
TARA,"They're gonna be a little while longer, doing the detective thing. Best non-scoobies like you and me stay out of the way."
TARA,Do you wanna thumb-wrestle?
DAWN,Okay.
BUFFY,"Judging by the bite-fest, I'd say it was more than one vampire."
GILES,(standing up) I make it four at least.
BUFFY,"Looks like someone's put together a new fang club. (Walks to the counter. Willow is behind it, holding a book.)"
WILLOW,"Well, I've cross-checked the inventory list, and things are definitely missing. (puts inventory book on the counter) Mostly books. Including <i>A Treatise on the Mythology and Methodology of the Vampire Slayer</i>."
BUFFY,"Oh, shoot! Was that the only copy?"
GILES,"Come on, Buffy, this could be very serious. Whoever's leading this pack of vampires appears to be interested in learning more about you. Perhaps searching for weaknesses or ... good lord."
BUFFY,What?
GILES,"Well, I had no idea the profit margins on a shop like this were so high."
GILES,"Look at this! Uh, low overhead, out-of-state orders, international - it's no wonder there's never any trouble attracting new owners. (Looking around) A place like this is a virtual-"
BUFFY,Deathtrap?
GILES,"What? Well, uh, yes, there is that. But, uh, still... (puts book down and looks around some more) Location, pedestrian traffic..."
WILLOW,So what's the next step?
GILES,"(still gazing around) Buffy, you should begin looking for their lair straight away."
BUFFY,I'll get Riley to help me patrol.
WILLOW,"Wait, aren't you forgetting something?"
GILES,Impressive square footage...
WILLOW,You're on Dawn duty.
BUFFY,"Oh, duty. I gotta drop my sister back home. (eyes widening) My mother's gonna *kill* me."
GILES,"(wandering back into view) I bet the death rate keeps the rent down. (pauses) Oh, hello. Something's been taken from this case, look here."
BUFFY,What'd they take?
GILES,"I should think an item of, of value, or-or power, possibly even a-"
WILLOW,A unicorn. 10-inch ceramic unicorn imported from Thailand.
BUFFY,Was it valuable?
WILLOW,"(OS) List price, $12.95."
GILES,"Which begs the question, what kind of an unholy creature fancies cheap tasteless statuary?"
HARMONY,"Okay, hi. First of all, I wanna thank everybody for a really successful raid on the magic shop last night. (applauding) Good job, minions!"
HARMONY,"Yes, you deserve it. Secondly... (turns away to reach for something) somebody remembered to pick me up the sweetest little unicorn! (Holds up the ceramic unicorn and smiles at Brad. The other vamps stare at him.)"
BRAD,(whispering to other vamps) What?
HARMONY,"Brad, guess someone was feeling guilty for standing me up in the tenth grade. (Admiring the unicorn)"
BRAD,"(to other vamps) I, I had to get her something. She sired me."
Peaches,(to Cyrus) Sire-whipped.
HARMONY,"Anyway, the books you guys brought me to help with the plan? Well, I've been skimming through the book jackets all morning, and let me tell you, there's some pretty useful stuff in there, so-"
HARMONY,"Yes, uh ... sorry, forgot your name."
CYRUS,Cyrus.
HARMONY,"Cyrus, huh, right. Peaches' friend. (Peaches nods) What's your question?"
CYRUS,When are we gonna do it?
HARMONY,"Eww! That's rude! I barely know you! (Cyrus looks sideways at the other vamps in confusion) Uch, and you're a minion!"
MORT,He means the plan! When are we gonna do the plan?
HARMONY,"Ohhh! The plan! (laughs in embarrassment) Ah, well, first lemme tell you I'm really psyched about it and I hope the rest of you guys-"
MORT,(yelling) When?!
HARMONY,(yelling) Tonight! (more calmly) We kill the slayer ... tonight. (Smiles in self-satisfaction.)
JOYCE VOICEOVER,So not only didn't you take your sister shopping for school supplies-
JOYCE,-you brought her to a murder scene.
BUFFY,"No, I didn't bring her to it, it ... just ... sorta came upon us. It's not like she saw the body or anything."
JOYCE,"Oh, well. That makes it all right then, doesn't it?"
BUFFY,"No, that is not what I meant."
JOYCE,"I asked one favor of you, Buffy. To look after your sister. And now you want to unload her, so you and Riley can go out."
BUFFY,"To patrol. I'm working, it's not like I wanna go to the sock hop."
JOYCE,I have to be at the pre-show reception in half an hour. Who's gonna watch Dawn?
DAWN,"(OS, calling from her room) I don't need anyone to watch me!"
BUFFY and JOYCE,(unison) Yes you do!
BUFFY,"Wait. So what you're saying is if I can get an acceptable babysitter here before you leave, I can go patrol?"
DAWN,(OS) Babysitter? I'm fourteen! I'm old enough to *be* a babysitter!
JOYCE,And who are you gonna get on such short notice?
DAWN,(OS) I can take care of myself!
BUFFY,(suddenly realizing) Xander.
JOYCE,Xander?
DAWN,Okay.
XANDER,Dawn patrol.
DAWN,(smiling) Hey.
XANDER,"Check this out, they put cheese on round bread. It's gonna be big."
DAWN VOICEOVER,"Xander is so much cuter than anyone. And smarter too. He totally skipped college and got a job working construction. Which is so kind of ... deep, you know? He builds things. And he's brave too."
DAWN VOICEOVER,Just last week he went undercover to stop that Dracula guy.
<dir>Note: the closed-captions provide the following dialogue during this scene which is not actually heard,
JOYCE,"Xander, thanks for doing this."
XANDER,Total non-sweat.
JOYCE,"Again, thanks for coming. Oh, uh, here is my card. If you have any problems, you just call me on the cell phone.</dir>"
XANDER,"Have fun. Not too much fun, though. (Although we can hear this line and it sounds like Xander's voice, we see his face, and it's clear that his lips aren't moving.)"
JOYCE,"Dawn, be good. (Kisses Dawn goodbye)"
XANDER,"Oh, we will. We're just gonna play with matches, run with scissors, take candy from ... some guy ... I don't know his name. (Winks at Dawn. Joyce leaves, and Dawn, smiling at Xander, starts to shut the door.)"
DAWN VOICEOVER,Xander treats everyone like an equal. He doesn't look down on people.
ANYA,"Hello there, little girl."
DAWN VOICEOVER,Even when he should.
ANYA,"(talking as if to a very small child) We are gonna have fun, fun, fun. Look, I've got Monopoly, Clue, and ooh, the Game of Life! That sounds good!"
TARA,(OS) Poor Dawn.
TARA,She was pretty shaken up.
WILLOW,"Well, sure. Bloody death and stuff."
WILLOW,She'll be okay.
TARA,"It's just ... I, I think it's tough for her, not being able to ... well, allowed to, you know, help."
WILLOW,Help?
TARA,"Oh, you. You guys. The slayer circle."
WILLOW,"Well, Buffy doesn't really need ... a-and I think Dawn's a little young."
TARA,"I-I know, you're right. It's just hard. That outsider feeling."
WILLOW,Tara ... you're not an outsider.
TARA,"Well, yeah. I kinda am."
WILLOW,"(walking toward her) No, you're not."
TARA,"Willow, it's okay. Where does this go?"
WILLOW,"Somebody making you feel uncomfortable? Is it Xander? It's Xander, isn't it?"
TARA,"No, Xander's a sweetie."
WILLOW,It's Giles! It's 'cause he's ... British and doesn't understand about stuff.
TARA,It's no one. (Continues taking stuff out of the box) You guys all just have this really tight bond. It's-it's hard to break into that. And I'm not even sure I want to.
WILLOW,I'm sure.
WILLOW,You're completely one of the gang now. Everyone accepts that.
WILLOW,You're one of the good guys.
WILLOW,"Maybe I can talk to the rest of the group and we can do something, some kind of scooby initiation. (They both return to what they were doing) Oh! Maybe we could wear some kind of special ring that identifies us as members."
TARA,I don't think so. But maybe something like that would be nice for Dawn. I do worry about her sometimes.
WILLOW,You don't have to. She's got big sister Buffy happily looking out for her.
BUFFY,So then my mom goes off on me about how I'm supposed to watch out for Dawn and make sure that she's shielded from something that might upset her.
RILEY,Like dead shopkeepers.
BUFFY,"She didn't see him! A foot, maybe. A dead foot, which is bad, okay, but hello, I see dead stuff *all* the time, and you don't see Mom shielding me."
RILEY,"So you want your mother to give you space to be a slayer, and shield you from it at the same time."
BUFFY,"Thank you, logic boy. Did I mention this is a rant? Sense really has no place in it."
RILEY,"I'm getting that. (sighs) What's the deal, Buffy? You seem really-"
BUFFY,"Oh, trash can. From a distance it looked kinda-"
RILEY,Tense.
BUFFY,"Nooo, I-I was gonna say brown, squat, shadowy..."
RILEY,Uh-uh. Back to what I was saying before we were rudely attacked by nothing. You seem really tense.
BUFFY,"(shrugs) Yeah, there's a new vampire gang in town."
RILEY,I mean domestically tense. You're on Dawn's case a lot.
BUFFY,"I guess. It's just... (sighs) I don't know, it ... I know it's always been this way. She's the baby. But for some reason lately, it's just really getting to me. She's *always* around."
RILEY,"Well, yeah. You're like her idol, Buffy."
BUFFY,"Her idol? I don't think so, unless you like to spill things on your idol's new leather pants, and-"
RILEY,You know what I mean. You have super powers ... and college ... a studly yet sensitive boyfriend...
BUFFY,And a pesky life-or-death job that I can't quit or even take a break from.
RILEY,She doesn't get the sacrifices. She's a kid.
BUFFY,"And that's what bugs. *She* gets to be a kid, and she acts like it's the biggest burden in the world. Sometimes *I* would like to just curl up in Mom's lap and not worry about the fate of the world. I'd like to be the one who's protected, who's waited on-"
DAWN,"-hand and foot, getting her own way. Always the favorite."
XANDER,"You nut. Your mom loves you both equally. But if I'm wrong, I find money usually helps tip the scale. Slip Joyce a 10 or a 20 once in a while. Then we'll see who's the favorite."
DAWN VOICEOVER,He says I'm like a kid sister...
XANDER,(looking at the game board) Here comes the judge!
DAWN VOICEOVER,"...but sometimes when he looks at me, I feel like he sees me as I am..."
DAWN VOICEOVER,...as a woman.
ANYA,"Oh, crap. (slaps down her cards) Look at this! Now I'm burdened with a husband and several tiny pink children, more cash than I can reasonably manage..."
XANDER,That means you're winning.
ANYA,Really?
XANDER,Yes. Cash equals good.
ANYA,Ooh! (claps her hands in excitement) I'm so pleased. (Scoops up the plastic markers that represent children) Can I trade in the children for more cash?
XANDER,"""Slayer, come out and die."""
HARMONY,"(OS) I'm waiting for you, Buffy!"
HARMONY,(yells) I know you're in there!
HARMONY,"(OS) What do you mean, she's not in there?"
HARMONY,She has to be. I'm calling her out!
XANDER,Then I bet she'll be real sorry she missed your call. 'Fraid you and your buddies are gonna have to come back and be killed by Buffy later.
HARMONY,(scornful) They're not my buddies. They're my minions.
XANDER,They're ... what now?
HARMONY,"Minions! You know, lackeys? They work for me."
HARMONY,What's so funny?!
XANDER,"Nothing! What could be funny, just ""Look out, it's a terrifying Harmony gang, ooh!"" (Laughing)"
HARMONY,"Stop laughing! (Tries to attack him, but she can't go past the doorway. Dawn ducks behind Anya. Xander continues laughing)"
XANDER,"I just, I just can't picture anyone pathetic enough to be following- (Looks at the minions again and pretends to be shocked) Is that Brad Konig? Huh! Hey Brad, who'd have thought when you were beating up kids in gym class, you'd end up Harmony's lapdog?"
BRAD,"Screw you, Harris."
HARMONY,You should know all about being somebody's lapdog. I hear you were a good little puppy for Dracula.
XANDER,You heard wrong.
HARMONY,(laughs) Don't feel bad. I hear that mind-control thing he does works really well on weak fraidy-cat losers. You didn't stand a chance.
DAWN,(still behind Anya) Shut up!
XANDER,"Dawn, I'm handling this. Shut up, Harmony!"
HARMONY,Make me.
XANDER,Fraid I don't feel like getting into another hair-pulling contest with you.
HARMONY,"You're the hair-puller, you big girl!"
DAWN,Oh yeah? Come inside and say that! Xander will kick your-
ANYA,"Dawn, no!"
XANDER,The invitation was for one.
HARMONY,"Not such a pushover any more, am I? (Punches Xander in the face a few times)"
ANYA,(running around) Slayer's house have more weapons lying around. (Picks up a lamp)
HARMONY,"I've been working out, learning some new tricks, honing my -"
HARMONY,Instincts.
HARMONY,"This isn't over, Xander! I'll be back!"
XANDER,And we'll be ready for you! Stakes ... crosses ... the whole enchilada.
XANDER,Buffy is not going to be happy about this.
BUFFY,Harmony ... (laughing) Harmony has minions?
XANDER,"Yeah, that was pretty much my reaction."
BUFFY,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (Clear throat and stops laughing) It's just ... Harmony has minions! (Starts laughing again)"
XANDER,"And Ruffles have ridges. Uh, Buffy, there's actually a more serious side to all this."
BUFFY,"I sure hope so, 'cause I'm having trouble breathing. (Giggles, then stops and takes a deep breath) What is it?"
XANDER,"(nervously, looking at Anya) Well, she did come here to kill you."
RILEY,"(chuckling) Buffy, come on, they have killed once that we know of. She could be a threat to you. (Buffy laughs harder)"
ANYA,Especially now that she can enter your house any time she wants.
BUFFY,What?
XANDER,"Uh, yeah, actually, she -- Harmony -- kind of happened to sort of get an invite."
BUFFY,"You guys can't invite her in. I mean, only someone who lives here can- (The clue hits. Xander nods. Buffy frowns.)"
BUFFY,(quietly) Where is she?
ANYA,"In her room. Look, I think she's still pretty freaked out."
BUFFY,Dawn! (starts to stomp out. Xander stops her)
XANDER,"Buff, it was an accident. She didn't mean it."
BUFFY,"Oh, well that just makes it okay then, doesn't it? (Stomps out)"
XANDER,"(calling after her) No, but believe me, nobody feels worse than her right now."
HARMONY,"What a total disaster. My first plan! I so wanted it to go well. Plus, I didn't even get to kill stupid Xander Harris! God, that was so embarrassing."
MORT,We'll go back later.
HARMONY,No! It's no good. Buffy's gonna expect us now. The whole surprise is blown.
PEACHES,(to Cyrus) Who're you growling at?
CYRUS,"Not me, my stomach. If I don't eat somebody soon, I-I'll get dizzy."
PEACHES,Let's go back to the lair. That census taker may not be empty yet.
BRAD,"Not me. This night is young, and I want some action."
SPIKE,"Happy to oblige. Here I thought it was gonna be a slow night. (puffing on a cigarette, sizing up the minions) Step on up, kiddies. Thrashings for all."
HARMONY,Stop!
SPIKE,"Well. Hello, Harm."
HARMONY,"Spikey. I mean, Spike."
SPIKE,Long time. You look good.
HARMONY,I feel good.
SPIKE,(smirks) I remember.
HARMONY,How've you been?
SPIKE,"(shrugs) Not bad. Just got a brand-new telly in my crypt, so..."
MORT,(walking up behind Harmony) Why are you talking to him?
HARMONY,"It's okay, we used to go steady. (sighs) Spike, Mort. Mort, this is-"
MORT,I know who he is. He kills our kind.
HARMONY,Oh yeah! (to Spike)What's up with that?
SPIKE,"(shrugs) Bloke's gotta have a hobby, don't he? Piss off, Mort."
HARMONY,"Mort, just give us ... a couple minutes, 'kay? (Turns back to Spike) He's really testy. Some of us were thinking of voting him out of the gang. (She and Spike step aside where the minions can't overhear.)"
SPIKE,Gang?
HARMONY,"Oh, yeah. I've got my own gang now."
SPIKE,(checking out the minions) Is that what those circus freaks are?
HARMONY,Uh huh. I mean ... shut up! (Spike grins) We're gonna kill the slayer.
SPIKE,"Singing my song now, are you? You should pay me royalties for that one, or at least get your own tune."
HARMONY,"I'm not gonna make the same mistakes you did. I've been doing my homework, reading books and stuff."
SPIKE,"What, <i>Evil for Dummies</i>? (walks around her) Look at you, all puffed up and mighty, thinking you're the new Big Bad. It's, uh ... well, let's face it, it's adorable."
HARMONY,You just can't stand the fact that I'm my own person now. There comes a time in every woman's life when she realizes she needs to take the next step. I've taken it. I've found the real me... and I like her.
SPIKE,"Hope you'll be very happy together. In the meantime, save slayer slaying for the professionals."
HARMONY,(sighs) You'll see. Buffy'll be dead by sunrise. I've got a plan.
SPIKE,"(chuckling) Lemme guess. Snatch one of her friends, use 'em as bait, lead her into a trap. That sort of thing?"
HARMONY,"(bluffing) No! Much, much better one. (Spike looks skeptical.) I'm not gonna tell you!"
SPIKE,Thought as much. Best of luck. Let me know how this arch-villain thing works out for you. (Backs away and walks off)
HARMONY,I'll do that. (shouting after him) And after Buffy is gone? I'm gonna kill everybody in this town that was ever mean to me ... Spike!
HARMONY,(smiling) Guys! New plan.
RILEY,That's a lot of weapons for somebody you weren't sweating twenty minutes ago.
BUFFY,"Well, that was before Dawn gave Harmony a backstage pass to kill us all in our sleep."
XANDER,"Buff, I left word with Willow. She'll come do a return engagement of her uninvitation spell. She probably still has the stuff from last week. And bang, boom, you're back in the Fortress of Solitude. All better."
BUFFY,"No. Not all better. I mean, it's not like Dawn hasn't grown up in this house knowing all the rules."
BUFFY,"(OS) Especially the biggie! Numero one-oh. ""Do not invite bloodsucking dead people into our house."" (Dawn rolls her eyes)"
BUFFY,"I mean, please. I would never have Harmony over even when she was alive."
XANDER,"People slip, Buffy. Your mom did. She invited in the mas- (Catches himself) Dracula. In for coffee."
BUFFY,"Well, that was different. I mean, she ... He would ... She was lonely, and, and, and she didn't know he was a vampire. *The* vampire. Meanwhile, Dawn knew exactly what Harmony was and she rolled out the welcome mat for her."
RILEY,(OS) She's just a kid. (Dawn rolls her eyes)
BUFFY,"You know, will everybody please stop saying that? I was just a kid when I met my first vampire, but somehow, I still managed to remember the rules."
RILEY,You had to. It was your job.
BUFFY,"(putting on a jacket) No. No, it was common sense. But nobody expects even that much from Dawn, do they? No, she has to be protected and coddled from the big bad world, well you know what? We are doing nothing but turning her into a little idiot who is going to get us all killed."
BUFFY,"She just has to be more careful. Now, I can't be there to protect her 24 hours a day. I-I just can't."
ANYA,Hey! Don't!
ANYA,Dawn!
ANYA,What do you think you're doing?
DAWN,Leave me alone.
ANYA,I will after you come back inside the house. (Grabs Dawn and starts shoving her back toward the door.)
DAWN,Let go of me! (breaks free)
ANYA,"No, it's not safe out here!"
MORT,You got that right.
XANDER,Anya!
ANYA,"(half conscious) Oh, vampires took..."
RILEY,This head wound looks bad. We gotta get her to the hospital.
ANYA,(murmuring) They took her...
XANDER,"Shh, shh."
ANYA,Dawn.
BUFFY,Dawn? Wha-what about Dawn?
ANYA,She ran out ... they took her ... vampires...
BUFFY,"Oh god. Oh god. Uh, take care of Anya. (Hands the phone to Riley and runs out)"
RILEY,Buffy!
HARMONY,"All right, once again, nice work, minionators. I'm really, really proud of you guys. (Mort comes in) Ah, Mort. I trust you made our guest ... comfortable?"
MORT,(confused) You told me to chain her to a wall.
HARMONY,"Yeah, I know, I'm being, you know, sarcastic or whatever? (Mort looks blank) Anyway... (turns back to the other minions) I'm feeling really good about this new plan, people. I think it's a winner."
CYRUS,When do we eat the girl?
HARMONY,We don't. Not yet.
CYRUS,Why not?
HARMONY,Because! That's not the plan! (sighs) Do I have to go over the plan again? We use the sister as bait. We send Buffy a note-
PEACHES,More notes?
HARMONY,"(annoyed) We send Buffy a note, telling her that if she wants to see her sister again, she has to come alone to a place we choose. She comes, we jump her, we kill her. (Peaches nods.)"
MORT,"So it doesn't really matter if we're actually holding the slayer's sister, just as long as she thinks we are. She'll walk into the trap."
HARMONY,I guess.
CYRUS,So it won't make any difference if we eat the girl now.
HARMONY,We're not eating the girl.
PEACHES,Why not?
HARMONY,Cause! That's not the plan.
SPIKE,Bollocks. Gonna have to pinch one of those satellite dishes.
SPIKE,"Well, speaking of dishes, to what do I owe this unpleasant- (Buffy hits him in the face) Ow! Bloody hell!"
BUFFY,"(grabbing his shirt) I don't have time for banter, Spike. Where's Harmony's lair?"
SPIKE,Haven't seen her in months. How should I know- (Buffy hits him in the face again) Ow!
BUFFY,Where is she?
SPIKE,At least lay off the nose. (Buffy pulls back her fist) Okay! Okay! Used to have a cave in the north woods. About forty meters past the overpass construction site.
SPIKE,Ow!! I was telling you the truth!
BUFFY,(leaving) I know.
HARMONY,"They don't respect me. They pretend they do, but deep down they think I'm nothing."
HARMONY,"I mean, I'm the one who put this group together. Me! But they treat me like I don't even matter. Do you have any idea what that feels like?"
DAWN,A little.
HARMONY,(whining) They have no idea how much pressure I'm under. I have to make all the hard decisions. And it's hard!
HARMONY,"Excuse me, I didn't hear anybody knock."
MORT,"We've been talking it over, and we decided we don't like this plan."
PEACHES,(scornfully) Except for Brad. He abstained.
HARMONY,(angry) Oh really? You have a plan you like better?
MORT,We're gonna feed on the girl and kill you.
MORT,Maybe not in that order.
HARMONY,"I don't think I like your attitude, Mort. (to the others) Kill him for me."
HARMONY,"All right. You're all on my list. (Looks nervous as Mort advances toward her) Th-this isn't fair. Okay, so things haven't been perfect. I just need a little more time to grow into my leadership role."
MORT,Time's up.
DAWN,(nervous) Touch me and my sister's gonna kill you.
BUFFY,Can't say she didn't warn him.
HARMONY,(to Mort) And you didn't like the plan.
BUFFY,"Dawn, close your eyes."
HARMONY,"So, slayer, at last we meet."
BUFFY,"We've met, Harmony, you halfwit."
HARMONY,"I'm the halfwit? Um, excuse me, but look who's fallen into my-"
HARMONY,Trap.
BUFFY,"Harmony, when you tried to be head cheerleader, you were bad. When you tried to chair the homecoming committee, you were really bad. But when you try to be bad ... you *suck*."
DAWN,"Buffy, watch out!"
HARMONY,"Ooh, good shot, Mort, I think you got her on the-"
BUFFY,You are going to be in so much trouble when we get home. (Strikes at the chains with the axe)
DAWN,"Yeah, well ... I'm telling Mom you slayed in front of me."
BUFFY,"Fine. I'll just tell her that you ran out of the house in the middle of the night, (another strike at the chains) that you got Anya hurt, (another strike) invited a vampire in, (strike) got kidnapped...."
JOYCE,"Sorry it ran so late. Everything, uh, go okay?"
BUFFY,"Yeah. Yeah, you know ... I got the vamps and we watched some TV."
JOYCE,"(smiles) Well, I know at least one of us who's supposed to be in bed by now."
JOYCE,Night.
BUFFY,So how was the exhibit?
JOYCE,"(opening the fridge) Oh, it was fantastic."
DAWN VOICEOVER,Buffy probably would've gotten in way more trouble than me anyway.
DAWN VOICEOVER,"But I guess it was pretty okay of her not to say anything to mom. Anya's gonna be okay, and Xander wasn't mad at me. So stuff mostly worked out."
BUFFY,"Giles, are you sure about this?"
GILES,Why wouldn't I be?
BUFFY,"Well, aside from the fact that most magic shop owners in Sunnydale have the life expectancy of a Spinal Tap drummer ... and, have you ever run a store before?"
GILES,"I was a librarian for years. This is exactly the same, except people pay for the things they don't return. (comes out from behind counter) It'll give me focus. Increase my resources. And it'll prevent you lot from trampling all over my flat at all hours. (he and Buffy walk toward the back) There may even be some space for you to train in the back."
BUFFY,"Boy, you've really thought this through. How bored *were* you last year?"
GILES,I watched <i>Passions</i> with Spike. Let us never speak of it. (Exits)
BUFFY,Don't. Break. Anything.
BUFFY,Just don't *touch* anything. (exits)
DAWN VOICEOVER,Not that Buffy's really changed at all. Like she ever would.
BUFFY,"What you're doing right now, not moving? (Makes the ""okay"" sign with her fingers) Good. Keep doing that. (Exits)"
DAWN,"She still thinks I'm Little Miss Nobody, just her dumb little sister. Boy, is she in for a surprise."
