XANDER,<br>  I used yellow crayon. It was a thing from when I talked to Willow on the bluff.   I hope she gets it.

DAWN,<br>  Uh-huh. I'm getting nervous. Are you nervous?
BUFFY,<br>  Yeah. It's gonna be weird seeing her. What do you say to someone in this situation?
XANDER,"<br>  I'm gonna say &quot;Hi, Willow.&quot;"
BUFFY,<br>  C'mon. You're saying it's not going to be the least bit strange? We saw her   kill someone. She was about to kill Dawn&#151;
XANDER,<br>  And Giles wouldn't let her leave unless she completed that whatever recovery   course.
DAWN,<br>  Right. (Buffy smiles guiltily. Dawn looks at Buffy) Right?
BUFFY,<br>  She kinda didn't finish.
DAWN,<br>  She didn't finish? She didn't finish being not evil?
