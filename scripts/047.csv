Willow,Obscurate nos non diutius.
Translation,Do not conceal any longer.
Buffy,(yells) Now!
Giles,I think that was the last.
Buffy,"Willow, you okay?"
Willow,"(breathing hard) Yeah, I'm fine. Th-the shaking is, is a side  effect of the fear."
Giles,(on his feet) Thank you. (takes off his glasses and rubs his  brow)
Buffy,"Well, if it wasn't for that clouding spell..."
Willow,"(smiles) Yeah, it went good! (glances at the candle) Nothing  melted like last time."
Faith,These babes were wicked rowdy. What's their deal?
Giles,I wish I knew.
Giles,"Most of my sources have dried up since the, uh, Council has  relieved me of my duties. I was aware there was a nest here, but quite  frankly, I expected it to be vampires. These, these are new."
Buffy,And improved.
Giles,"(stands up) Yes. I'm sorry. I should've had you better prepared,  and I should never have allowed Willow and, uh... (looks around) And,  uh..."
Xander,"(out of breath) I'm good. We're fine. (gets up) Just a little  bit dirty. (gives two thumbs up) Good show, everyone. (staggers out into  the cave) Just great. I think we have a hit."
Willow,(concerned) Are you okay?
Xander,"Tip-top, (exhales) really. If anyone sees my spine laying  around, just try not to step on it."
Buffy,"(worried) Xander, one of these days, you're gonna get yourself  hurt."
Faith,Or killed.
Buffy,"Or both. A-and, you know, with the pain and the death, maybe you  shouldn't be leaping into the fray like that. M-maybe you should be...  fray-adjacent."
Xander,"(slightly miffed) Excuse me? Who, at a crucial moment,  distracted the lead demon by allowing her to pummel him about the head?"
Faith,Yeah. That was real manly how you shrieked and all.
Xander,(haughtily) I think you'll find that was more of a bellow.
Buffy,"Uh, what do we do with the trio here? Should we burn them?"
Willow,(smiles) I brought marshmallows.
Willow,"(with dignity) Occasionally, I'm callous and strange."
Giles,"I expect we can leave them. I'm more interested in finding out  what they are, and whether we can expect more of their kind."
Buffy,(starts out of the cave) I hope not. They're *way* too fit.
Xander,I say bring 'em on!
Giles,"Uh, Xander, I think in the future perhaps it would be best if  you, you, uh, h-hung back to the rear of the battle, you know, for your  own sake."
Xander,"(facetiously) But, gee, Mr. White, if Clark and Lois get all  the good stories, I'll *never* be a good reporter."
Giles,(not getting it) Hmm?
Xander,"Jimmy Olsen joke, sir. Pretty much gonna be lost on you, huh?"
Giles,Sorry.
Xander,"Hey, it's okay."
Xander,"Hey, Doug, pass me one!"
Xander,"Les-man, I'm open!"
Xander,"Les, buddy!"
Xander,"Doug, right here, man. Right here."
Xander,"Doug, please!"
Xander,Alright! It's all me!
Xander,"Boy, I am *so* sorry. Doug's arm is kinda like spaghetti.  (chuckles) We're all so very sad for him. (grins) Is your lunch okay?"
Jack,"(not amused) What are you, retarded?"
Xander,"No! No, I had to take that test when I was seven. A little slow  in some stuff, mostly math and spatial relations, but certainly not  challenged or anything. (points down) Can I get you another soda?"
Jack,I oughtta cut your face open.
Xander,"(nervous) Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa... It was an accident.  Cool down."
Jack,(smiles thinly) You wanna be startin' somethin'?
Xander,"What? Starting something? (grins) Like that Michael Jackson  song, right? (chuckles) That was a lot of fun. 'Too high to get over,  yeah, yeah...' Remember that fun song?"
Jack,"I get my buddies together, we're gonna kick your ass till it's a  brand-new shape."
Jack,Now get outta here.
Doug,"Yo, man, the ball!"
Cordelia,"Boy, of all the humiliations you've had I've witnessed, that  was the latest."
Xander,(points back at Jack) I could've taken him.
Cordelia,"Oh, please. O'Toole would macrame' your face. He is a psycho.  Which is still a lot cooler than being a wuss."
Xander,"(glances at Jack) Why is it that I've come face-to-face with  vampires, demons, the most hideous creatures Hell ever spit out, and I'm  still afraid of a little bully like Jack O'Toole?"
Cordelia,"Because, unlike all those creatures that you've come face-to- face with, Jack actually noticed you were there."
Xander,Why am I surprised by how comforting you're not?
Cordelia,"It must be really hard when all your friends have, like,  superpowers -- Slayer, werewolf, witches, vampires -- and you're, like,  this little nothing. (Xander looks down) You must feel like Jimmy Olsen."
Xander,"(chuckles) I was just talking to... (suddenly offended) Hey,  mind your own business!"
Cordelia,"Ooo, I struck a nerve. The boy that had no cool."
Xander,I happen to be an integral part of that group. I happen to have  a *lot* to offer.
Cordelia,"(starts to leave) Oh, please."
Xander,I do!
Cordelia,"(stops and turns back) 'Integral part' of the group? Xander,  you're the, the *useless* part of the group. You're the Zeppo. (Xander  glances at Jack) 'Cool.' Look it up. It's something that a sub-literate  that's repeated twelfth grade three times has, and you don't."
Cordelia,There was no part of that that wasn't fun.
Xander,"But... It's just that it's buggin' me, this 'cool' thing. (cut  to them) I mean, what is it? How do you get it? Who doesn't have it? And  who decides who doesn't have it? What is the essence of cool?"
Oz,Not sure. (reaches for a chip)
Xander,"I mean, you yourself, Oz, are considered more or less cool. Why  is that?"
Oz,Am I? (eats a chip)
Xander,"Is it about the talking? You know, the way you tend to express  yourself in short, noncommittal phrases?"
Oz,(considers) Could be.
Xander,(smiles) I know! You're in a band! That's like a business-class  ticket to cool with complementary mojo after takeoff! I gotta learn an  instrument. Is it hard to play guitar?
Oz,(shakes his head) Not the way I play it.
Xander,"Okay, but on the other hand: eighth grade. I'm taking the  fl√ºgelhorn and gettin' *zero* trim. So the whole instrument thing could  be a mislead. (thinks) But you need a thing, one thing nobody else has.  What do I have?"
Oz,An exciting new obsession. Which I feel makes you very special.
Xander,Now with the mocking. Which I can handle because I know I'm  right about this. I'm on the track. I just need to find my thing. (gets  lost in thought)
Oz,"It seems like you're over-thinking it. I mean, you got some  identity issues. It's not..."
Giles,The end of the world? (heads behind the counter)
Buffy,(turns) Can they do that? (goes to the counter)
Giles,"They seem fairly committed. (gets a book) The Sisterhood of Jhe  (brings it over) is an Apocalypse cult. They exist solely to bring about  the world's destruction, and we've not seen the last of them. More will  follow."
Buffy,And they're here in Sunnydale for what? Demon Expo?
Giles,"(takes off his glasses) Buffy, this is no laughing matter."
Buffy,Hence my no laughing.
Giles,"I'm sorry. (slips his glasses back on) I know I'm no longer your  official Watcher, but..."
Oz,Hey.
Buffy,Hey.
Giles,"(checks his watch) Um, y-you're cutting it a bit close."
Oz,"(steps into the cage) Well, you know me."
Buffy,"(to Giles) Well, do we know why they're here?"
Giles,"I think so. (looks around) Based on some artifacts I, I found  with them, and, um, (sees and reaches for another book) taking into  account the current astral cycle..."
Buffy,"(interrupts) Giles, I don't need to see the math."
Giles,(seriously) They intend to open the Hellmouth.
Buffy,(looks up in surprise) The Hellmouth. The one that opens...
Giles,About twenty feet from where you're standing.
Willow,And if it opens?
Buffy,Do you remember the demon that almost got out the night I died?
Willow,"Every nightmare I have that doesn't revolve around academic  failure or public nudity is about that thing. In fact, once I dreamt  that it attacked me while I was late for a test and naked."
Buffy,"Well, it'll be the first to come out, and Giles says it won't be  the worst by a long shot. The world will be overrun with demons if we  don't stop it."
Willow,Do we know when this is supposed to happen?
Buffy,"(shrugs) Giles is trying to narrow it down. I-if you're up for  it, we're heading into deep research mode."
Willow,I'd be offended if you haven't already counted me in.
Buffy,"Thanks, Will. There's something about this one that... scares  me. (puts her arm around her friend) I need my Willow."
Willow,"Oh, you don't have to be afraid..."
Xander,You girls need a lift?
Buffy,What is this?
Xander,"What do you mean, what is it? (gestures around himself) It's my  *thing*."
Willow,Your thing?
Xander,(emphatically) My *thing*!
Buffy,(frowns uncertainly) Is this a penis metaphor?
Xander,"(sighs heavily) It's my thing that makes me cool. You know,  that makes me unique. (sees their blank looks) I'm Car Guy. Guy with the  car."
Willow,How can you afford it?
Xander,"Uncle Roary stacked up the DUIs, let me rent this bad boy till  he's mobile again. (turns off the radio)"
Buffy,"(tries to smile) Well, i-it's nice."
Xander,Could you sound a little less enthused?
Buffy,Sorry.
Willow,Evil.
Xander,Big?
Buffy,Biggest. Maybe more than I can handle.
Xander,(pulls off his shades) Then we'll handle it together. You know  I'm here for you. Just tell me what I can do.
Xander,"I'll take two glazed, two cinnamon, couple cream-filled, and a  jelly. No, no, let's round that out to four jellies."
Cordelia,"(mockingly) Ooo, is some evil going on? Must be big for them  to entrust you with this daredevil mission."
Xander,(counts out his money) Cordelia. Feel free to drop dead of a  wasting disease in the next twenty seconds. (hands it to the clerk)
Cordelia,"(pleased) Ooo, again, I strike the nerve. I am the surgeon of  mean."
Xander,"(walks past her with the box) I'm kinda busy right now, okay?"
Cordelia,(turns around) Right. Buffy needs your help. Can you say  'expendable'?
Xander,(faces her) You think you know everything.
Cordelia,(steps up to the counter) I think I know you.
Xander,That's a laugh.
Cordelia,"(tauntingly) Oh, what, you got a shiny car, and now you're  someone new? Like anybody even cares about..."
Lysette,Is that your car?
Xander,"(surprised by the attention) Why, uh... (smiles) Yes! It is!"
Lysette,'57 Chevy Bel Air... 283 CID... Solid lifter... Fuel-injected  V-8...
Xander,(has no idea) Uh... very possibly.
Lysette,(abruptly) How does she handle?
Xander,"Like a dream about warm, sticky things."
Xander,(to the girl) Would you like to go for a little drive?
Lysette,You busy?
Xander,"(holds up the doughnut box) Just gotta drop this stuff off, and  then I would describe myself as... (making a face at Cordelia)  expendable."
Lysette,"...and then I started seeing Dave Peck. Had a Thunderbird,  engine completely tricked out, but the upholstery was kind of shot. So  then I started seeing his friend Mike. Not the Mike with the Mercedes.  The Mike with the Mustang. An '82 V-6. You know the look."
Xander,Angel!
Xander,Buddy! Friend-buddy. (gestures at the table) You wanna sit and  talk?
Angel,(comes over) I'm looking for Buffy.
Xander,"Library, last I saw."
Angel,Something's happening. I've seen portents.
Xander,(grins) The Apocalypse. They're on top of it.
Angel,I don't think they know what they're dealing with.
Xander,Let's go there... and tell them that.
Angel,No. (waves him off) It's best you stay out of harm's way.
Xander,(desperate to get away) But I can help!
Lysette,"Hey, you wanna go for another drive?"
Xander,"Y'know, it's not like I haven't helped before. Y'know, I've  done some quality violence for those people. (opens the door) Do they  even think about that?"
Xander,"I mean... (starts it, puts it in drive) they act like I'm, like  I'm some sorta klutz."
Xander,"Oh, God! Are you alright?"
Xander,"Oh, God! Stay calm. Little fender bender. It's not..."
Xander,(apprehensive) ...the end of the world.
Willow,He's cranky.
Buffy,It's a good night for it.
Willow,"Can't dogs sense when there's an earthquake, a-a-and they bark?  Or cows lie down or something? (looks at Oz again)"
Buffy,"(reads) 'Sisterhood of Jhe. Race of female demons, fierce  warriors...' Eww. '...celebrate victory in battle by eating their foes.'  They couldn't just pour Gatorade on each other?"
Giles,The Council wouldn't even take my calls. (disgusted) Idiots. (to  the girls) Anything useful in the books?
Buffy,Not wildly. (closes hers)
Willow,We still have the Books of Pherion to go through.
Buffy,"(sets her book down) I'm getting itchy feet, Giles. We don't  turn up something soon, I'm gonna hit the streets. (grabs and opens  another) Maybe check out Willy's."
Giles,Fine.
Willow,Where are you going?
Giles,"Um, to try and contact the Spirit Guides. (takes his overcoat  from its hanger) They exist out of time, but have knowledge of the  future. (pulls it on) I have no idea if they will respond to my efforts,  but I have to try. (comes back from his office) All we know is that the  fate of the entire world rests on it. (looks into the doughnut box) Did  you eat all the jellies?"
Buffy,(innocently) Did you want a jelly?
Giles,(petulantly) I always have a jelly. I'm always the one that says  'let's have a jelly in the mix.'
Willow,We're sorry. (tattles quickly) Buffy had three.
Giles,No matter. (grabs his bag) If Xander makes another run...  (starts to go)
Buffy,No. (Giles stops) Xander's out of this. He nearly got killed  last time we fought. This whole thing will be easier if we know he's  safe.
Xander,"(nervously) Oh, gosh, Jack, man, are, are you okay? (points at  the bumpers) I am really sorry about that. But your car came out of  nowhere."
Jack,(incredulous) I was parked.
Xander,"Exactly. Look, I can cover the damages. I don't have insurance  in the strictest sense of the word, but I have a little money. The  important thing is that we're alright and we can work this out like two  reasonable..."
Xander,...frontiersmen.
Jack,(points the knife at Xander) Where do you want it?
Xander,What?
Jack,Where do you want it?
Xander,"I'm fairly certain I don't want it at all, but, uh, thank you."
Lysette,(bored and impatient) Wow. Cool knife.
Xander,"Yeah. Great knife. Although I think, uh, it may technically be  a, a sword."
Jack,She's called 'Katie'.
Xander,"You gave it a girl's name. How very serial killer of you.  (turns to Lysette) Listen, I think we should be going."
Jack,(jeeringly) Are you scared?
Xander,(shakily) Would that make you happy?
Jack,"(sneering) Your woman looking on, you can't stand up to me? Don't  you feel pathetic?"
Xander,(nervously) Mostly I feel Katie.
Jack,You know what the difference between you and me is?
Xander,Again... Katie's springing to mind.
Jack,Fear. Who has the least fear.
Xander,"And it has nothing to do with who has the big, sharp..."
Jack,Come on.
Lysette,I wanna go for a drive. I'm bored.
Xander,"(sarcastically) Oh, gee, I'm really sorry my life-and-death  situation isn't *exciting* enough for you..."
Jack,Nothing. Just rasslin'.
Xander,(to the officer) No. Just blowing off steam. (grins) Two guys  rasslin'. (shakes his head) But not in a gay way.
Xander,What?
Jack,That was alright. Could've narc'd on me. Didn't do it. That's  decent of you. I like you. (smiles appraisingly)
Xander,(still nervous) Yay?
Jack,(to Lysette) You two wanna have some fun?
Lysette,"(smiles dippily) Like, with driving?"
Jack,Yeah.
Xander,What do you have in mind?
Jack,"Well, I was on my way to get the boys. Gonna cruise around.  (checks out Xander's Chevy) We'll take your wheels."
Xander,What about your car?
Jack,(looks at it and shakes his head) It ain't mine.
Xander,Great. Where to?
Jack,Gonna get the boys!
Xander,"Yeah. (pulls the door closed) So, where're the boys?"
Jack,"He calls forth the Spirit of Uurthu, the restless. No one shall  speak. (raises his arms) He shall arise! Hear me..."
Jack,The blood of the Earth shall restore him...
Jack,And he shall arise.
Jack,Shall arise!
Bob,Buddy.
Jack,Bob.
Jack,"You big, hideous corpse... Come here!"
Xander,(resentfully) I'll call ya!
Bob,Man! You *raised* me!
Jack,(looks him up and down) I *told* you grandpappy could work that  mojo. Big Bob is back in action!
Bob,(raises his arms) Yes!
Bob,"Oh, man, I can't believe you raised me! That is so awesome!  (starts to calm down, lets go of Jack) You are the coolest."
Xander,Maybe I should just let you guys catch up. (starts to go)
Jack,"Bob, this is Xander. He's our wheel man."
Bob,Hey.
Xander,Howdy.
Bob,"(steps back to Jack) Dude, where are the other guys? We gotta go  get 'em."
Jack,(nods) Absolutely.
Bob,(pats him on the arm) Alright.
Xander,"Are, um... Are all your friends dead?"
Jack,"(over his shoulder) Xander, let's roll."
Bob,How long I been down?
Jack,Eight months. I had to wait till the stars aligned.
Bob,"Oh, eight months. I got some catching up to do."
Bob,"Whoa! Walker, Texas Ranger. You been taping 'em?"
Jack,Every ep.
Bob,"Alright. We're gonna get the guys together, and we're gonna PARTY,  man! (hits Xander hard in the other shoulder) It's gonna be a night to  remember! (they start walking again) Yeah!"
Xander,(trailing them) I'm sensing that.
Jack,"The blood of the Earth shall restore him, and he shall arise."
Dickie,Dudes!
Giles,"Noli me renuere, umbra ducens. Sapienta manium super me  effundatur."
Translation,"Do not deny me, Spirit Guide. Let the wisdom of those who  have passed be showered upon me."
Translation,These secrets belong to time and the dark regions. To  reveal them would bring Chaos down upon the living Earth.
Giles,Belua propulsanda est! Invenire vitium suum noster spes sola  est!
Translation,The Beast must be fought! Our only hope lies in finding  its weakness!
Translation,(angrily) Seek not! Disturb us no longer!
Xander,"Giles, hey... (smiles) What's goin' on?"
Giles,"Oh, uh, (looks at the mausoleum) I was just trying to, uh, gain  access to the, um, Spirit Guides. Not going very well, I'm afraid.  (looks around) Uh, what are you doing here? (packs his things)"
Xander,"Oh, we were just raising, um... (glances back at the others)  some heck."
Jack,(impatient) Xander! Let's go!
Xander,"(kneels by Giles) Listen, do you guys need any help?"
Giles,"(concentrating on packing) Hmm? Oh, no. Thank you. Uh, probably  best if you, you stay out of trouble."
Xander,No chance of that.
Jack,(impatient) Xander! Motor!
Giles,"(stands up) There's something... different about this... menace,  something in the air... The stench of death."
Xander,"Yeah, I think it's Bob."
Giles,(absently) We may all be called upon to fight when it happens.  (picks up his bags)
Xander,"When what happens, exactly?"
Jack,(very impatiently) Come on!
Giles,"I better go. (smiles weakly) Um, hopefully, we shall have time  to prepare. All we need is a few weeks. (turns and leaves)"
Buffy,Tonight?
Willy,"(nods, laboring to breathe) Before sunrise. That's what they  said. (winces in pain)"
Buffy,(looks at the damage) Why did they do this?
Willy,They were looking for Angel.
Buffy,Angel? Why?
Willy,"(breathing shallowly) Said they were coming after you, too, and  nothing could stand in their way because (winces in pain) tonight was  the night..."
Willy,"(painfully) Oh, man..."
Buffy,(worried) The ambulance is on its way.
Willy,"(coughs, swallows) Look, kid, my clientele ain't exactly nuns  and orphans, but I... I never seen anything like these demons."
Buffy,I'm gonna stop them.
Willy,(coughs) That Hellmouth opens (swallows) they're gonna be the  least of your problems is my train of thought.
Willy,(between shallow breaths) If I were you... I'd go find Angel...  go somewhere quiet together. I'd be thinking about how I wanna spend my  last night on Earth.
Bob,LET'S GET SOME BEER! YEAH!
Parker,"Dude! Let's go pick up some girls, man. We'll hang out at Taco  Bell, get some girls, go cruise around..."
Dickie,I wanna bake a cake.
Bob,"Hey, we need some beers, though."
Parker,"(to Bob) I can't believe you got shot, man. Was it them  Jackals?"
Jack,Are you kidding? We wiped them out after they threw you off the  bridge.
Parker,"(appreciatively) Oh, man. You guys, you guys are the best, man.  The best! I mean that."
Bob,(explains to Parker) There's a liquor store. Little Armenian guy  runs the place? He had a gun behind the counter.
Bob,Hey... We should go kick his ASS!
Parker,Yeah!
Bob,YEAAAAAH!
Xander,"If you guys want me to drop you off somewhere, that's..."
Jack,"(interrupts, pats Xander's shoulder) Nah. You're with us now."
Parker,"Oh yeah, man, you on the team now, baby. Whoo-hoo!"
Bob,(serious) What're we gonna do?
Jack,"Well, I've heard some interesting suggestions, but I'm gonna have  to go with Dickie's. Let's bake a cake."
Dickie,Yeaaaaah!
Jack,Alright.
Jack,(to Xander) You stay here and keep the motor running. (joins the  others)
Xander,"Uh, this time of night, I'm pretty sure nothing's open."
Xander,But they're always open for *crime*.
Xander,Okay. Now I'm involved in crime. I'm the criminal element.  (sarcastically) Having a car sure is cool!
Willow,Thank you. Sorry to wake you. (starts down the street)
Shopkeeper,No problem.
Xander,Will!
Willow,"Xander, what are you doing here?"
Xander,Nothing. Certainly not crime. (grins guiltily and glances  behind him) Wh-what about you?
Willow,(worried) I-I needed supplies for a protection spell. Buffy  called from Angel's. I-it's happening tonight.
Xander,And that thing that's happening would be...?
Willow,I-I can't stay. Buffy'll needs this.
Willow,"I love you, Xander."
Xander,"Okay, that's it. (turns back to the car) I'm gonna..."
Jack,Where you going?
Xander,"Look, something's just come up. (looks at the store)"
Jack,You gonna bail on me? Is that it?
Dickie,(smiling) We got the cake mix! (puts the bags in the car)
Parker,Where you wanna bake it?
Jack,(ominously) Xander's looking to leave.
Bob,No way. (comes around the car) We need a wheel man. (stands behind  Xander)
Jack,(menacingly) Xander doesn't feel like he's part of the group.
Xander,(placatingly) No. It's just I'm kinda busy!
Bob,He doesn't feel like part of the group because he hasn't been  initiated.
Jack,Do you think he's ready?
Parker,"(puts his arm around Xander) Oh, I think he's earned his  stripes. I say we let him in, boys. Huh?"
Dickie,(chuckles) Woo-hoo!
Xander,"(grins) Great! (nods) I wanna be in the gang, sure!"
Parker,Alright! (nudges him in the gut) Yeah.
Jack,(lifts his finger to Xander) That's the spirit.
Parker,Yeah.
Xander,"(smiling, getting into it) What do I gotta do?"
Jack,(twists the blade threateningly) You gotta die.
Xander,"(nervously) Alright, guys, what... Let's just talk about this."
Parker,"Aw, you wanna be part of the gang now, don't you?"
Xander,"Yes, yes, but I'm not *dying* to be in the gang, if you get  the, um... the pun there."
Bob,"(insulted) What? You're, you're too good to be dead?"
Bob,You got a problem with dead people?
Xander,What about Jack? Jack's not dead.
Jack,Drive-by three weeks ago.
Xander,"(exhales) Oh, boy."
Jack,"Grandpappy found my body. I wasn't gone but ten minutes before he  raised me. It's a rush, man."
Dickie,(smiling) Let's kill Xander. It'll be fun!
Parker,"Yeah, man, you could be a full-fledged member."
Jack,"(steps closer and sneers) Come on, Xander. Take it like a man."
Xander,"(takes a chance) Alright, enough! You guys have had your fun,  but you forgot about *one* thing."
Jack,Get him!
Bob,Damn him! (throws up his hands) There goes the wheels.
Parker,"(plaintively) He took all our stuff, man."
Dickie,I wanna bake a cake.
Jack,(seething with anger) It's alright. We'll get more. The night is  young.
Xander,I'd say that's pretty much enough excitement for one evening.
Xander,(to Faith) Get in!
Xander,You think Demon Mama followed us?
Faith,"No, we're cool. (takes off her jacket) The bitch dislocated my  shoulder, though."
Faith,Hold me.
Faith,That's better. (sniffs) She got me really wound up.
Faith,A fight like that and... no kill... I'm about ready to pop.
Xander,(nervously) Really? (looks down at her rubbing hands) Pop?!
Faith,(smiles sexily) You up for it?
Xander,"(nods) Oh, I'm up."
Xander,"I'm suddenly *very* up. It's just, um... (grins sheepishly)  I've never been up with people before."
Faith,Just relax... And take your pants off.
Xander,Those two concepts are antithetical.
Faith,Don't worry. (pulls off her own shirt) I'll steer you around the  curves.
Xander,Did I mention that I'm having a very strange night?
Faith,That was great. I gotta shower.
Willow,I've never seen him like this.
Giles,It's the Hellmouth. He can sense it's going to open. Be ready  just in case.
Giles,Now don't hesitate.
Willow,Do it.
Giles,Now Oz...
Giles,AGAIN!
Giles,We've got to move him before he wakes up.
Willow,(remorsefully to Oz) Sorry. I hope you're not mad at me in the  morning.
Xander,Hey! They're not baking any cake.
Xander,Long gone. Probably loaded with supplies. Gotta think.
Xander,"I can't believe I had sex. (catches himself) Okay, bombs.  Already-dead guys with bombs. (realizes) Oh, man, I'm outta my league!  Buffy'll know what to do."
Buffy,(pleading) I don't know what to do.
Angel,Then let me decide for you. I can face this thing.
Buffy,(protests) You can't.
Angel,"Look, I, I can at least buy you enough time for Willow's spell  to bind it."
Angel,"Buffy, this is worse than anything we've ever faced. It's the  only way."
Buffy,(voice cracking) I can't watch you die again.
Angel,I love you.
Buffy,(takes his hand) I love you.
Angel,Nothing can change that. Not even death.
Buffy,"Don't talk to me like that! *You* may be ready to go, but *I* am  not ready to lose you. Okay, this is my fight, and if you won't do it my  way, then you're..."
Xander,"(grins) Hey. I've got this, um... There's this, uh... (grins  sheepishly)"
Xander,(awkwardly) It's probably a bad time.
Xander,Can I help?
Xander,Okay.
Xander,"Okay, I can work this out. I just got to figure out what they'd  be likely to bomb."
Giles,"Terra, vente, ignis et pluvia. Cuncta quattuor numina, vos  obsecro. Defendete nos a recente malo resoluto."
Translation,"Earth, wind, fire and rain. Linger four gods, we implore  you. Defend us, immediately after I will release you."
Willow,"Okay. Oz is moved. He could barely walk after that mickey I  gave him, but we made it. Is he gonna be alright there?"
Giles,"Anywhere is safer than here. Um, help me with the candles."
Willow,We're doing the binding spell from the Hebron's Almanac?
Giles,"Yes, but once it's ready, (lights a match) you're to stay back  and let me finish the recitation. (Willow starts to protest) Don't  argue. I want you safe. Who knows what's going to come up from beneath  us."
Parker,Whoo!
Jack,This is gonna be large! (smiles at Parker)
Parker,"Oh, yeah!"
Xander,(frantically) Giles will know what to do. He's *way* more calm  than Buffy.
Xander,"Okay, I got a plan."
Bob,"Hey, our wheels."
Parker,Hey!
Parker,"(scared) Stop! C'mon, man! Stop!"
Xander,Where's the bomb?!
Parker,"It's in, it's in the high school!"
Xander,In the school where?!
Parker,"Oh, God, this really, really hurts!"
Parker,Stop!
Parker,"It's in the, it's in the boiler room."
Xander,"Alright. Now I'm gonna ask you this once, and you better pray  you get the answer right."
Parker,"(still scared) Okay, okay."
Xander,How do I defuse...
Xander,(chagrined) I probably should've left out that whole middle  part.
Dickie,He's headed for the school!
Jack,There he is!
Xander,Where's a Slayer when you need one?
Giles,"Oh, my God. It's grown."
Dickie,Wow.
Jack,"C'mon, man!"
Bob,Which way?
Jack,He couldn't have gotten far. Let's split up.
Bob,Good for chopping.
Bob,Now this is what I call fun.
Xander,"Should've learned by now. If you're gonna play with fire, you  gotta expect sooner or later..."
Xander,(insulted) I wasn't finished!
Xander,Note to self: less talk.
Buffy,Faith! Go for the heart!
Xander,"Okay, boiler room."
Xander,Other way.
Xander,"Hello, nasty."
Xander,(breathing hard) Less than two minutes. Dumb guy. Little bomb.  How hard can it be?
Jack,And it just got harder.
Xander,I'm not leaving till that thing's disarmed.
Jack,Then I guess you're not leaving.
Jack,"(angrily) I'm gonna carve you up and serve you with gravy. You  piss me off, boy. Now you pay the price. First the eyes, then the  tongue. I'm gonna break every one of your fingers."
Xander,You gonna do all that in forty-nine seconds?
Xander,"I know what you're thinkin'. Can I get by him? Get up the  stairs, out of the building, seconds ticking away... I don't love your  chances."
Jack,"Then you'll die, too."
Xander,"(raises his eyebrows) Yeah, looks like. So I guess the question  really is... who has less fear?"
Jack,(tries to psyche Xander out) I'm not afraid to die. I'm already  dead.
Xander,"Yeah, but this is different. Being blowed up isn't walking  around and drinking with your buddies dead. It's little bits being swept  up by a janitor dead, and I don't think you're ready for that."
Jack,Are you?
Xander,"(glances at the bomb, smiles thinly) I like the quiet."
Giles,Omnia... vasa... veritatis!
Translation,All things... the vessel... of truth!
Giles,"Now, Buffy!"
00,"12, 00:11, 00:10, 00:09..."
00,"08, 00:07, 00:06..."
00,"05, 00:04..."
00,"03, 00:02..."
Xander,Good boy.
Xander,"I don't think I wanna be seeing you on campus anymore, Jack."
Jack,"I'm not going anywhere, Harris. The first time you turn your  back..."
Willow,"Even after the Hellmouth was closed, you could still hear it  screaming."
Oz,But Angel's gonna be okay?
Buffy,He was only out for a few minutes. Longest of my life.
Willow,"(shakes her head) I will never forget that thing's face. Its  *real* face, I mean."
Giles,Yes.
Buffy,(to Giles) I don't know how you managed. (he looks up at her) It  was the bravest thing I've ever seen.
Giles,(grins) Stupidest.
Giles,But the world continues to turn.
Willow,No one will ever know how close it came to stopping. Never know  what we did.
Xander,(finds them) Guys...
Willow,"Xander. Boy, you're lucky you weren't at school last night. It  was crazed."
Xander,"(shrugs) Well, uh, gimme the quiet life. (grins) I'm gonna grab  a snack. Anyone want?"
Giles,"(quietly) No, thank you."
Xander,Oz?
Oz,No. I'm oddly full today.
Xander,Okay.
Cordelia,"Ooo, look, it's Mr. Excitement. On another life-or-death  doughnut mission, or are we just cruising for bimbos again, giving them  lessons in lack of cool?"
Cordelia,What?
Cordelia,(unnerved) What?
Cordelia,(insistently) What?!
