GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
WATCHER,You are the chosen one.
WATCHER,You alone can stop them.
BUFFY,Who?
WATCHER,The vampires.
WATCHER,You see your power.
BUFFY,Why can't you people just leave me alone?
GILES,Into each generation a Slayer is born.
WILLOW,"You're the Slayer, and we're like the Slayerettes."
XANDER,"The three of us have been together from the beginning. We've always gone on patrols, and, uh, done demon research with her and everything."
BUFFY,We're talking about two very powerful witches (shot of Willow and Tara doing a spell) and a thousand-year-old ex-demon (shot of Anya)
XANDER,"Anya, you wanna marry me?"
BUFFY,Angel.
ANGEL,I love you.
BUFFY,So don't go.
SPIKE,Home sweet home.
DOCTOR,That chip was deeply imbedded in your cerebral cortex.
SPIKE,I can't bite anything. I can't even hit people.
GILES,What are you saying?
SPIKE,"Spike had a little trip to the vet, and now he doesn't chase the other puppies any more."
SPIKE,"I know you'll never love me. I know that I'm a monster, but you treat me like a man."
SPIKE,"They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the key to her in the form of a sister."
GREGOR,You were created to open the gates that separate dimensions.
GREGOR,The little girl. The key.
GREGOR,"Destroy it, and the will of the beast will be broken."
DAWN,No!
DAWN,I have to jump.
BUFFY,It'll kill you.
DAWN,Look at what's happening!
DAWN,"Buffy, no."
BUFFY,"Dawnie, I have to."
BUFFY VOICEOVER,You have to take care of each other. You have to be strong. Be brave. Live.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,For me.
SPIKE,I'm never gonna get anything killed with you lot holding me back.
TARA,(panting) I thought the big ones were supposed to tire more easily.
SPIKE,"No, that's over-the-hill shopkeepers."
GILES,"(leaning against a gravestone, panting) I'm fine. I just need to ... to die for a minute."
SPIKE,(to Tara) It was that powder you blew at him made him rabbit off.
TARA,"It's sorbis root, it was supposed to confuse him, but ... it just kinda made him peppy."
TARA,"It's not supposed to mix with anything, you think he might be taking prescription medication?"
SPIKE,"(sarcastic) Yeah, that must be it."
GILES,"Good god, I hope he doesn't try to operate heavy machinery."
SPIKE,"Yeah, we could all be in real-"
WILLOW,"(telepathically) Guys, heads up."
WILLOW,"(telepathically) The vampire's circling back towards you, six o'clock."
WILLOW,(telepathically) Try to drive him back towards the Van Elton crypt.
SPIKE,(telepathically) Van Elton.
TARA,(aloud) Is that the one with the cute little gargoyles?
WILLOW,"(telepathically) Left, make him go left!"
BUFFY,"Big, fast, and dumb. Just the way I like 'em."
XANDER,Sounds like the other units are engaged.
WILLOW,"(telepathically) Xander, Anya, stop!"
XANDER,"Great googly-moogly, Willow, would you quit doing that?"
WILLOW,(telepathically) I told you I was going to get the lay of the land.
XANDER,But not the lay of my brain.
ANYA,It's kind of intrusive. You could knock first or something.
WILLOW,(telepathically) Xander-
XANDER,"I know, I know, I don't have to talk when I answer you. But I saw ""The Fury,"" and that way lies spooky carnival death."
WILLOW,(telepathically) Xander! Vampire! Other side of that tomb. You can get the jump on him if you go the other way.
XANDER,Why didn't you just say so?
WILLOW,"(telepathically) Tara, down!"
GILES,(choking) Spike!
GILES,Spike!
WILLOW,(telepathically) What are you doing? Help him!
SPIKE,(lighting a cigarette) I did.
GILES,You might have let me in on your plan while he throttled me.
SPIKE,"Oh, poor Watcher. Did your life pass before your eyes? Cuppa tea, cuppa tea, almost got shagged, cuppa tea?"
WILLOW,"(telepathically) Guys, help Xander and Anya over by the Anderson tomb."
ANYA,Xander!
BUFFY,I got it!
BUFFY,"(triumphantly) That'll put marzipan in your pie plate, bingo!"
SPIKE,"(to Willow) What's with the Dadaism, Red?"
TARA,"Yeah, she says that pie thing every time she stakes a vamp now."
WILLOW,"I-I don't know, I was trying to program in some new puns and I kinda ended up with word salad."
BUFFYBOT,(brightly) I think it's funny.
WILLOW,"It's a glitch, I'll fix it."
GILES,"We just can't have her messing up in front of the wrong person. Or the wrong thing. We, we need the, the world and the underworld to believe that Buffy is alive and well."
WILLOW,"And I will therefore fix it. I got her head back on, didn't I? And I got her off those knock-knock jokes."
BUFFYBOT,"Ooh, who's there?"
XANDER,"You know, if we want her to be exactly-"
SPIKE,She'll never be exactly.
XANDER,I know.
TARA,The only really real Buffy is really Buffy.
GILES,And she's gone.
BUFFYBOT,'If we want her to be exactly she'll never be exactly I know the only really real Buffy is really Buffy and she's gone' who?
WILLOW VOICEOVER,Where's my clog?
WILLOW,I think there's a clog-eating monster under the bed. (gets up) It's really those lesser-known monsters that make living in Sunnydale so hard.
TARA,I believe that that is a Dawn monster. She borrowed them yesterday.
WILLOW,"Dawnie? (knocks on Dawn's door, which is ajar) Hey, you up?"
TARA,You okay? (They walk out into the hall)
WILLOW,"(nods) Besides terror about today and a general feeling of impending doom, swell."
TARA,Breakfast will make all things better.
WILLOW,"(smiles, takes Tara's hands) Ooh, pancakes could go in bellies."
WILLOW,Dawnie?
WILLOW,"Hey, you! Today's the big day, huh? Kinda day that makes you wanna return clogs, don't you think?"
DAWN,(very garbled through her toothbrush) I didn't take your clogs.
WILLOW,Morning.
BUFFYBOT,(cheery) Morning!
WILLOW,I was thinking we could go over your programming again.
TARA,"Again? You've done enough, sweetie. She's either ready to face this thing or she's not."
TARA,"Oh, um, here's some juice, and... (gives Dawn a glass of orange juice) pancakes are on the way. Funny shapes or rounds?"
DAWN,"Rounds are fine. Uh, what's up with the mega-witches?"
TARA,"Oh, I don't know if you can call us mega, Willow maybe-"
DAWN,"No, I mean ... who's gonna eat all that?"
TARA,"Oh! Oops, um ... she wanted to help, and I got her started, but then I forgot to un-start."
XANDER,"House of chicks, relax. I am a man, and I have a tool."
XANDER,"Tools. Lots of plural tools. (Dawn grins) In my, uh ... (pats toolbox) toolbox. (sees the sandwiches) Ah! Sandwiches. Excellent. Men like sandwiches."
WILLOW,"Help yourself. Really. (Xander eating a sandwich) So what brings you so early, your macho-ness?"
XANDER,I brought that soldering wire you wanted for BuffyBot's tune-up.
TARA,"(serving pancakes to Dawn) You got funny shapes anyway, sorry."
BUFFYBOT,I'll get it!
WILLOW/TARA/DAWN,No! (all move to intercept her)
DAWN,Um ... it could be my dad. (to Willow) He said he'd call today.
BUFFYBOT,I'll just say hello. He's my biological ancestor.
WILLOW,"(into phone) Hello? Hey, Anya. (The bot looks disappointed, goes back over toward Xander) Really? That's fantastic! (to others) Uh, Anya found that thing, for tonight."
XANDER,(looks nervously at BuffyBot) Yeah? Great.
WILLOW,(listens) And you're her sweet cookie-face.
XANDER,I go by many names. (The bot looks at him in confusion)
DAWN,"Well, what's tonight?"
TARA,"Oh, just a Scooby meeting. Spike'll be here with you."
WILLOW,"You know, Buffy ... bot ... maybe you should let the machine - uh, the other machine, answer the phone from now on. Okay?"
BUFFYBOT,Is my phone manner not correct?
TARA,It's perfect. It's just ... we can't take the chance that Mr. Summers might talk to you and know something's wrong.
XANDER,"See, if he thought the real Buffy was gone, he could take Dawn away."
DAWN,"And I wanna stay here, with you and Willow and Tara. Understand?"
BUFFYBOT,(big smile) I do! I want you to stay here as well. You're my sister!
XANDER,So. Excellent. We're agreed. Sit your robo-self down so we can get to work. (The bot sits next to Dawn) We gotta fix up those fighting skills pronto.
WILLOW,"Actually, we have bigger worries than her fighting skills today."
TARA,Way bigger.
XANDER,I guess. Depends on how highly you prize punning.
WILLOW,"I'm serious, Xander. Buffybot is about to face her most dangerous challenge ever."
Cut to,"exterior of the Sunnydale Junior High. A big sign reads, ""Welcome to Parent Teacher Day."""
DAWN,Okay. So we'll make a quick lap so people can see you're here.
DAWN,Then we'll-
BUFFYBOT,What is this?
DAWN,"Oh, um, this is our city of the future. (We see a boy Dawn's age on the other side, listening in) I made the hover-cars. They're orange-juice cans, see?"
BUFFYBOT,They're very nice. (frowns) But I-I still don't understand.
TEACHER,"We're reading Walden. This is, uh ... a kid's version of a utopian society. You'll notice there are no schools but an extraordinary number of pizza parlors. (Dawn grins)"
BUFFYBOT,I don't think I know of a breed of humans this small. Who's going to live here?
DAWN,"Ha ha ha! Oh ... god, she's always like this. Ha ha! Come on, wacky Buffy. (takes the bot's arm) See ya, Mr. Davis."
MS. LEFCORT,"As you can see, we've provided the best in progressive learning. But we can't teach your children unless you do. As parents, you have a responsibility to create the right attitude. To teach your child what school can mean."
MS. LEFCORT,Ms. Summers.
BUFFYBOT,School is where you learn.
MS. LEFCORT,Exactly.
MS. LEFCORT,Parents let  kids focus on school as a social experience rather than a learning experience. We want you to get your kids just as excited about education as they are about the lunch hour.
BUFFYBOT,I helped make lunch today.
MS. LEFCORT,(uncertain) Oh.
BUFFYBOT,"(cheery) Yes, before school. Peanut butter and jelly. I don't eat, but Dawn takes one every day."
DAD,Tell me about it. (Everyone turns to look at him) My kid's been brown-bagging it even though I pay for the lunch program.
MOM,It's true. Something has to be done about the quality of the food.
Cut to,overhead shot of downtown Sunnydale. Cars and people go by.
GILES,"Anya, this register report for January looks a bit off. (Anya turns to him) Pull the files again."
ANYA,Are you mad at me?
GILES,"(confused) Mad? No, I'm-I'm-"
ANYA,"Well then why are you torturing me? You know, I used to punish people like this when I was a demon. (Giles rolls his eyes) I made them double-check spreadsheets for all eternity."
GILES,"I'm sorry if you resent my authority, but I won't feel comfortable leaving here until I know that absolutely everything-"
ANYA,(grabs a small statue from the desk) You're taking the Ramadan effigy?!
GILES,"(rolls his eyes again) It's not inventory, it's my personal collection. (takes the statue)"
ANYA,"(indignant) Oh, huh. Aren't you Mister Dicey Semantics. So, what, you think you can just take anything you want?"
ANYA,Give it!
GILES,"No, you give it!"
GILES,Ow! Ow!
GILES,Ow!
XANDER,"Okay, when *I'm* marveling at the immaturity ... (they pause and look at him) be scared."
XANDER,"Anya, Giles is gonna leave the store to you when he goes. What more do you want?"
GILES,"I'm not *leaving* the store to anyone. I'm going to England. I'm not dead, I'm still a partner. (yanks the statue away from Anya)"
ANYA,(sullen) Silent oversees partner.
XANDER,"Who you should be very nice to, unless you want to end up working at Video Hut."
XANDER,What are you doing? What kind of gratitude is that?
ANYA,"(quietly) I know, I know. It's just ... he keeps saying he's going, and then he doesn't. And I keep almost being in charge, but then I'm not. And maybe he shouldn't be going at all, but we can't talk about that. (agitated) And it all just leaves me with this stress and bossiness stored up, and it just ... leaks out."
XANDER,"Just give it time, Ahn. This is hard for all of us. Just ... be patient."
ANYA,"I *was* being patient, but it took too long. I mean, I-I miss Buffy. I do. But life shouldn't just stop because she's gone. I'm sick of waiting to take over here, and I'm sick of waiting to tell everyone about us."
XANDER,We've talked about this. We can't announce our engagement while things are so up in the air.
ANYA,Why not? It's happy news. Happy news in hard times is a good thing.
XANDER,"It is, but ... if things go as planned, everything could be different. (Anya sighs) Let's just hold on."
ANYA,You've been saying that all summer.
XANDER,"Please, Anya. We'll know more after we talk to Willow and Tara tonight."
ANYA,"Fine, whatever. Just remember that this whole marriage thing was your stupid idea. I didn't ask to be all crazy."
Cut to,"exterior of the Summers house, night."
DAWN,"So my homeroom teacher, Ms. Lefcort, was like, ""Your sister's an example to us all."" Hmm! She wanted to make it National Buffy Day."
SPIKE,Makes sense.
DAWN,It does?
SPIKE,"Yeah, she responded to BuffyBot because a robot is predictable. Boring. Perfect teacher's pet. That's all schools are, you know. Just factories, spewing out mindless little automatons."
SPIKE,"(quickly) Who go on to be ... very ... valuable and productive members of society, and you should go. (quieter) Because Buffy would want you to."
DAWN,Check. One mindless automaton coming up.
SPIKE,"So, uh, what do you fancy, bit, uh, game of rummy? (gets up)"
DAWN,"Well, uh, Willow and Tara said they'd be back early. (Spike goes to a side table, opens a drawer) You don't really have to hang. I mean, if you're bored."
SPIKE,"I'm not, and yeah, I do."
DAWN,"But I'm fine alone. It's not like anyone's coming after me. I'm not the key. (Spike sets the chair down) Or if I am, I don't open anything any more. It's over. Remember?"
SPIKE,"(softly) I'm not leaving you here by yourself, so forget it."
DAWN,"Well, I'm just saying-"
SPIKE,(not looking at her) No. I'm not leaving you ... to get hurt. (softly) Not again.
SPIKE,Now deal.
Cut to,"the street, night. A young woman closes up a shop and turns to walk down the street, putting keys in her purse. It's dark and very quiet. She pauses, looks behind her, walks on. She pauses again, looks back again, resumes walking very quickly."
BUFFYBOT,(OS) Don't be scared.
BUFFYBOT,I'm going to kill him.
VAMP,Slayer!
BUFFYBOT,You can run away now.
BUFFYBOT,Not you!
VAMP,"You're ... you're ... you're, you're a machine!"
BUFFYBOT,(smiles) Thank you!
BUFFYBOT,Stop!
BUFFYBOT,Vampires ... beware.
Cut to,"overhead shot of Sunnydale, night."
Cut to,exterior shot of Xander's apartment building.
TARA,The urn of Osiris.
WILLOW,(looks up) You really found it.
ANYA,(sits opposite Willow) Yeah. It wasn't easy. I went through every supplier the Magic Box has.
WILLOW,(alarmed) You used a Magic Box supplier? What if Giles finds out?
ANYA,"He's too busy not leaving to pay attention to me. (We see Xander standing beside Anya) Besides, I ended up getting it on eBay."
TARA,You found the last known urn of Osiris on eBay?
ANYA,"Yeah, from this desert gnome in Cairo. He drove a really hard bargain, but I finally got him to throw in a limited edition Backstreet Boys lunchbox for a -"
ANYA,...a friend.
XANDER,"So you got your somber on, Will, is the urn not up to spec?"
WILLOW,It's the one. (puts it down) Which means it's time.
XANDER,"(anxious) It's time? (sits) Like, *time* time? With the... (vague hand gestures) timeliness?"
ANYA,(quietly) Are you sure?
WILLOW,I am.
TARA,"Mercury's in retrograde, and we have... (to Willow) Do we have everything?"
WILLOW,(nods) Just about.
XANDER,"But why the sudden rushy-rush? I mean, did the bot blow our cover at school?"
TARA,"No, she did great, she impressed all the teachers."
XANDER,And they still thought it was Buffy?
WILLOW,"(turns back to them) Tomorrow night, we'll meet back here."
XANDER,(jumps up) Whoa! Let's apply the brakes and check the rear- and side-view mirrors here.
XANDER,"(more calmly) This is deep stuff, Willow. We're talking about raising the dead."
WILLOW,It's time we stop talking. Tomorrow night ... we're bringing Buffy back.
XANDER,(nervous) Tomorrow? I don't know.
ANYA,"(gets up to stand beside him) Um, Di-Discovery Channel has monkeys. And our tape machine's all wonky."
WILLOW,"Guys, I need you on board here."
XANDER,It's just ... (fidgets nervously) It feels wrong.
TARA,"It is wrong. (Willow looks surprised) It's against all the laws of nature, and practically impossible to do, but it's what we agreed to. If-if you guys are changing your minds-"
WILLOW,Nobody's changing their minds. Period.
XANDER,Excuse me? Who made you the boss of the group?
ANYA,You did.
TARA,You said Willow should be boss. (Willow moves away)
ANYA,"And then you said ""let's vote,"" and it was unanimous..."
TARA,"...and then you made her this little plaque, that said ""Boss of Us,"" you put little sparkles on it..."
XANDER,"Valid points, all. But we ... I mean..."
XANDER,We were just talking then.
WILLOW,"Xander, I can do this, I promise. But not without you."
ANYA,"Should we maybe tell Giles? You know, now that we're really ready? It's not like he's going anywhere. Ever."
WILLOW,"No. No one else can know. Not Giles, not Spike, not Dawn. (quietly) They might not understand."
TARA,What if something does go wrong?
WILLOW,I'm telling you it won't.
XANDER,"Scenario -- We raise Buffy from the grave, she tries to eat our brains. Do we, a) congratulate ourselves on a job well done-"
WILLOW,"Xander, this isn't zombies."
ANYA,Zombies don't eat brains anyway unless instructed to by their zombie masters. A lot of people get that wrong.
WILLOW,"This isn't like Dawn trying to bring Mrs. Summers back, or anything we've dealt with before. Buffy didn't die a natural death. She was killed by mystical energy."
TARA,Which means we do have a shot.
WILLOW,It means more than that. (to Xander) It means we don't know ... where she really is.
XANDER,"We saw her body, Will. We buried it."
WILLOW,"Her body, yeah. But her soul ... her essence ... I mean, that could be somewhere else. She could be trapped, in-in some sort of hell dimension like Angel was. (tearfully) Suffering eternal torment, just because she saved us, and I'm not gonna let ...  I'm not gonna leave her there. (intensely) It's Buffy."
XANDER,What time do we meet?
BUFFYBOT,(shouts) Willow!
WILLOW,"What happened, where's Dawn?"
SPIKE,"Upstairs, in bed. But the bot here seems to have got into a scrape while she was on patrol."
BUFFYBOT,I think my feet are broken.
WILLOW,"Eh, looks more like a short in the navigational system."
WILLOW,"Can you get me a flashlight? It's in the, uh, kitchen."
SPIKE,"(heads for the kitchen) She wanted to go out and look for you again, but I figured there are enough things in Sunnydale that go bump in the night. (exits)"
WILLOW,(sits facing the bot) Good thinking.
BUFFYBOT,But my homing device locates you when I am injured. I am programmed to go to you.
WILLOW,"(nods) Right, I know. Still, I think just this once, it was a good idea to stay put."
WILLOW,Spike was right. (pokes at the bot's innards)
BUFFYBOT,"Sorry I questioned you, Spike. (Spike looks surprised) You know I admire your brain almost as much as your washboard abs. (big smile)"
SPIKE,(quietly to Willow) I told you to make her stop doing that.
WILLOW,"I did. I mean, I thought I got all that stuff out of the program."
SPIKE,"Well, you've got her opened up, fix it."
WILLOW,"(typing) Sure. I mean, I have a lot of work here, but I'll see what I can do."
WILLOW,Can you shine the flashlight right here?
WILLOW,Spike!
BUFFYBOT,Did I say something wrong?
WILLOW,"(typing) No, it's not your fault."
BUFFYBOT,(pensive) I think Spike stopped liking me.
WILLOW,"That's not true, he-he thinks you're swell."
BUFFYBOT,Then how come he never looks at me any more? Even when he's talking to me.
WILLOW,"(nervous) He just gets cranky, the way vampires do. Now, just relax. I am gonna make you good as new."
WILLOW,I promise.
Fade to,"exterior of the house, night."
Cut to,"aerial shot of Sunnydale, day."
GILES,"That was splendid. (she stops hitting) Now ... try it again ... (panting) only this time, remember your breathing."
GILES,"No, uh, that's good, but, uh ... (We see Anya come in and stop in the doorway, watching) ...think of the breath as chi. Air as a, a life source."
BUFFYBOT,I don't require oxygen to live.
GILES,"Of course, strictly speaking, but-"
ANYA,"Um ... (walks into the room) Maybe you should stick to the standard drill. You know, you don't want her to blow another gasket."
GILES,I'm testing her responses after her injury. I see no harm in imparting a little Eastern philosophy.
ANYA,"Well, I just think that, the concept of chi might be a little, you know, hard for her to grasp."
ANYA,"You know, she's not the descendant of a long line of mystical warriors. She's the descendant of a toaster oven."
GILES,"Yes, well, I appreciate your input, Anya, but I think Buffybot has responded nicely to our sessions."
ANYA,"Well, you're the boss. (to herself) Still."
BUFFYBOT,Would you like to test me again?
GILES,"No, perhaps we should call it a day. Your ... your responses are fine."
GILES,Perhaps Anya's right. Perhaps I am trying to teach you as if you were...
BUFFYBOT,Human?
GILES,(uncomfortable) Yes.
BUFFYBOT,I like your teachings. Every Slayer needs her Watcher.
GILES,I'm not so sure about that.
BUFFYBOT,(frowns) What do you mean?
GILES,Nothing.
GILES,(looking away) I just can't help but wonder if ... she would have been better off without me. Buffy.
BUFFYBOT,I don't think that's true. You were very helpful to her.
GILES,"(laughs) Right. Yes, I was a perfect Watcher. I did what any good Watcher would do. Got my Slayer killed in the line of duty."
BUFFYBOT,"Oh, that wasn't your fault."
GILES,"Of course not. That's how all Slayer/Watcher relationships end, isn't it?"
GILES,She's gone. I did my job.
BUFFYBOT,"(frowns innocently) Well, then why are you still here?"
Cut to,demons on motorcycles. They drive up to a large building with a lot of other motorcycles parked outside. Loud rock music.
VAMP,"So I got her cornered in this alley, see..."
MAG,(skeptical) You get the Slayer cornered.
VAMP,"Yeah. I figured it's my duty. She's a menace to our society. So we fight, and I'm like, pow pow pow! (makes punching gestures) And I got her on the ropes."
MAG,You're lying to me.
VAMP,"(high, choked voice) I swear on all that's unholy! You haven't even heard the best part. I cut her, right? And she's -- I don't know, some kind of machine. She's not human!"
MAG,You're high.
VAMP,"I'm tellin' you, it wasn't even the Slayer, man. It was like a trick. (Mag looks at him) A robot."
RAZOR,What's with the blood rat?
MAG,(to the vampire) Talk!
VAMP,"(nervous) Okay, uh, so, I was over in Sunnydale, minding my own beeswax, when I see the Slayer-"
MAG,(shakes him) The part about the robot.
VAMP,"We fought, right? And I was like all over her, (punching gestures) boom boom boom...."
MAG,He says the Slayer's been replaced by some kind of machine.
VAMP,"A robot, yeah! And I kicked her synthetic ass. You shoulda seen the sparks-"
RAZOR,You tellin' me there's no Slayer in Sunnydale?
VAMP,"That's what I'm saying, they got some kind of decoy standing in for her. (false bravado) Town is wide open."
MAG,Nowhere like the Hellmouth for a party. There's all kinds of bad in that place.
VAMP,"I guess with your muscle, uh, you could own it in no time. (nervous chuckle) Hey look, I know you guys don't usually let vampires join the gang, and I got the whole (air quotes) sunlight issue. But I was thinking, you know, as thanks for the 4-1-1, you could let me go-"
RAZOR,I'll think it over.
RAZOR,Let's ride!
WILLOW,"Adonai, Helomi, Pine."
WILLOW,"Adonai, Helomi, Pine. The gods do command thee from thy majesty. (puts the lid on the jar, puts it down) O Mappa Laman, Adonai, Helomi. Come forward, blessed one. Know your calling."
WILLOW,"Come forward, blessed one."
WILLOW,(panting) Accept our humble gratitude for your offering. (puts knife down) In death ... you give life. (voice breaking) May you find wings to the kingdom.
TARA,Hey. You're late.
WILLOW,"Oh. (too casual) I, uh, had to get that thing."
XANDER,"Giles isn't around, you can dump the cryptic."
WILLOW,(nervous) The last spell ingredient.
XANDER,"Okay, right. What is vino de madre anyway?"
WILLOW,(walks over to them) Wine of the mother. Kind of ... black market stuff.
TARA,"Black market, you-you didn't tell me that. You shouldn't have gone alone, it could have been dangerous."
WILLOW,Sorry. I didn't ... I was careful.
ANYA,"Well, it must be something pretty intense. The black market's all baby teeth and spooky fluids. (moves toward counter)"
WILLOW,"(moves toward bookshelves) All I know is we have to have it to finish the spell, so, it's good stuff in my book. (takes a book from the shelf, returns to sit at the table) How come you guys are here anyway? I thought we weren't gonna meet till later."
XANDER,"Oh, we were. It just felt weird hanging out on our own."
TARA,It's better if we stay together.
WILLOW,"(takes Tara's hand) Aw, you got butterflies, baby?"
TARA,More like bats.
ANYA,Y-you wanna look at the money? I find it always calms me.
TARA,"That's okay, thanks."
WILLOW,You tell those bats that everything is gonna be all right. I promise. We couldn't be more prepared.
TARA,"I know, I just wish it was time, I-"
TARA,(OS) -I can't stand worrying about it anymore.
ANYA,"Um ... well, it's your lucky day then. I have something that will distract you."
WILLOW,What?
XANDER,"(reads) ""I've gone. Not one for long good-byes."" (Shot of Willow and Tara looking dismayed) ""I thought it best to slip out quietly. Love to you all, Giles."""
WILLOW,(OS) You really think we'd let you get away with that?
GILES,"(smiles) I was trying to avoid a scene, really."
WILLOW,Like we'd make a scene.
GILES,(quietly) Not you. Me.
ANYA,"Um, we, uh, brought you some lovely parting gifts. (holds something out) It's American. Get it? Apple pie?"
ANYA,To remind you of all the good food you won't be eating.
TARA,"A-and a monster, sort of a Sunnydale souvenir we thought."
TARA,Grr! Argh!
GILES,(smiles) Thank you.
XANDER,"And I wanted to buy you a can of Old English 800, 'cause, you know, England, and you, and ... because at the time it sounded really funny. But the guy who lives in the box in front of the store, he, uh, wouldn't buy it for us."
DAWN,We got your presents at the gas station. (sits beside Giles) We were kind of in a hurry.
DAWN,"Um, we made this in the car. That's why the letters are all shaky."
GILES,"(touched) This is, uh ... impossible, really."
WILLOW,"We just wanted you to know that ... we'll miss you. Uh, but we'll be okay. (softly) We'll miss you, but, (very softly) we'll be okay."
ANYA,I'll take really good care of your money.
GILES,"(laughs) Yes, I have no doubt."
P.A. ANNOUNCER,"...passengers, Flight 3982, leaving for Los Angeles, and continuing to London. Rows 20 through 30..."
GILES,That's me.
WILLOW,Now? We just made it.
GILES,"Just, yes."
GILES,"Well, if we're going to do this, let's do it properly."
GILES,I'm just a phone call away ... if you need anything. (holds Dawn's face in his hands) You must promise me.
DAWN,I do. I promise.
GILES,Willow. I don't know where to start. (they hug)
WILLOW,"(tearful) Well, maybe you shouldn't. (lets him go) I'm trying to be stiff-upper-lippy."
GILES,"Right, right. (removes his glasses)"
WILLOW,"Well, you should get going. (taps him on the shoulder) Don't you have a life or something?"
GILES,"(replaces glasses) Um, well, I suppose that's the question really."
GILES,"Just, uh ... be careful. Please."
WILLOW,(OS) There he goes.
XANDER,It's a good thing. My face was getting sore from all that faux smiling.
WILLOW,"It was right, though, wasn't it? Giving him the no-tears sendoff? I mean, we don't want him goin' off all worried about us."
ANYA,"He'd still be all worried, just ... eight hours ahead."
WILLOW,"What's he gonna do over there by himself? (they all start walking) I mean, he never talks about people from England. What if he's lonely?"
TARA,"He won't be lonely. He used to live there before, remember?"
DAWN,"And I'm sure we'll talk to him, right? It's not like he's-"
TARA,"We'll call him tomorrow, how 'bout that? (puts arm around Dawn's shoulder) See how his flight was? Yeah?"
XANDER,"(to Willow) Can you believe the timing? I mean, he's leaving right when we're ready to... (Willow glances nervously toward Dawn) ...do the thing tonight."
WILLOW,"(still looking at the sky) I know, I had hoped we'd figure it out before he, uh ... before he left."
ANYA,"Maybe we should have told him. I mean, what if it works?"
WILLOW,(still looking at the sky) He'll come back.
XANDER,It'll be dark soon.
WILLOW,"Yeah, we should get Dawn home. I want to go over everything one more time. Nothing can go wrong tonight."
WILLOW,Does everybody have their candles?
ANYA,"I'm trying, my lighter won't stay lit. (flicking lighter continuously)"
WILLOW,"Well, hurry, it has to-"
TARA,What time is it?
XANDER,(checks watch) A minute till midnight.
WILLOW,"C'mon, Anya, do you have it?"
ANYA,"(gets the lighter lit, lights her candle) I got it, I got it. I got it."
WILLOW,Okay. Start the circle. Now.
WILLOW,"Osiris, keeper of the gate, master of all fate, hear us."
WILLOW,"Before time, and after. Before knowing and nothing."
WILLOW,Accept our offering. Know our prayer.
XANDER,Willow! (reaches for her)
TARA,No! (stuttering) She t - she told me ... she'd be tested. This is supposed to happen.
WILLOW,(louder) Osiris! Here lies the warrior of the people. Let her cross over.
XANDER,She needs help!
TARA,"Xander, she's strong! She said not to stop, no matter what. If we break the cycle now, it's over."
ANYA,"Oh god, what is that noise?"
WILLOW,"(yelling) Osiris, let her cross over! Aah..."
TARA,"Oh my god, oh my god."
TARA,(anxious) It's a test. It's a test. Willow...
DAWN,What's going on?
SPIKE,(whispers) Stay away from the window.
DAWN,"What is it, what's happening?"
SPIKE,Just do as I say.
SPIKE,I'm going to check the rest of the house.
SPIKE,(OS) Don't move!
BUFFYBOT,(OS) That doesn't belong to you.
BUFFYBOT,Put it back.
RAZOR,Slayer. I've been hearing interesting things about you.
BUFFYBOT,Yes. I am interesting. (looks around) These your friends?
RAZOR,"They're my boys, yeah."
BUFFYBOT,Good. Now tell them to get back on their loud bicycles and go back wherever they came from.
RAZOR,Or what? You'll electrocute us?
RAZOR,Hold her.
RAZOR,You're nothing but a toy. A pretty toy. Wanna play?
BUFFYBOT,"I would, but you've injured me. I have to return to Willow."
RAZOR,Get her!
WILLOW,"Osiris, release her!"
BUFFYBOT,Willow! I need service!
TARA,Willow!
WILLOW,(screams) No!
TARA,Willow!
MAG,Look what I found!
XANDER,(yells to Anya and Tara) Take off! Go! Go!
TARA,Anya!
TARA,Dissolvo!
XANDER,"Willow. Willow, are you okay?"
WILLOW,(weakly) Did it work?
XANDER,(shakes head) I'm sorry.
Note,"This point marks the end of ""Bargaining Part 1."""
BUFFYBOT,"Oh, I'm dangerously close to- (a demon hits her in the face) -systems failure! Must - oh! - disengage from combat - so - oh! - Willow can service me."
RAZOR,"(swinging a length of chain) I'll service ya, girl toy!"
TARA,Willow!
XANDER,"I'm pretty sure she's okay. (gets up and goes to Anya) Or as okay as someone who's just had snakes coming out of their mouth. What the hell was that all about, Tara? (Tara looks up at him)"
ANYA,"Less talk, more running away."
XANDER,I'm sure the woods'll give us cover. Their motorcycles can't follow us in here.
ANYA,Someone should tell them that.
XANDER,"New plan. (goes to Willow, kneels and starts lifting her) Let's split up."
ANYA,"No, bad plan."
TARA,I'll take her.
XANDER,"No, I can carry her. (Tara looks anxious) I'll keep her safe."
TARA,(nods reluctantly) We should meet up somewhere.
XANDER,"The Magic Box. Whoever gets there first, call Dawn and Spike."
ANYA,Wait. What about the Buffybot?
XANDER,(indecisive for a moment) We can't. It's lost. (lifts Willow) Go!
WILLOW,"(loudly) Xan ... Xander, where - where-"
XANDER,"Shh! We're using our quiet voice, Will."
WILLOW,(whispers) Wh-wh-where's Tara?
XANDER,(panting) Off and running. Like we need to be. We gotta keep moving.
WILLOW,(panting) Oh ... right. Demons ... on bikes.
XANDER,Yeah. We got trouble. Right here in Hellmouth City. And our very own robo-Buffy led them right to us.
WILLOW,Buffy! The ritual! We have to go back. (sits up)
XANDER,(pushes her back) Will. I told you.
WILLOW,We have to try again.
XANDER,"No, we can't."
WILLOW,"We have to, Xander! I - she - she's waiting! She's counting on us, on, on me! I can't leave her there any more, I won't. We have to finish."
XANDER,Shh!
XANDER,(whispers) Will .. .the urn of cirrhosis...
WILLOW,Osiris?
XANDER,Yeah. It got kind of...
WILLOW,(remembers) Broken. It's broken. I remember.
XANDER,So we'll find another one. Better made. Anya and I will jump back on the web-
WILLOW,There is no other one. (closes her eyes)
XANDER,"Okay, we'll fix this one. A little tape, a dab of Crazy Glue."
WILLOW,"No. It's no use. (tearful) The urn's defiled. It's gone. Nothing, it was all for nothing. Buffy's gone. She's really gone."
MAG,(OS) Over here! Stop your moanin'.
ANYA,"(annoyed) Was that really necessary? A simple ""psst""-"
CLYED,I'm just saying it's rank.
MAG,"Get off it, Clyed."
CLYED,"Razor and the others head back to town, leave us here to hunt down strays. It's bullsh-"
MAG,"Hey! (grabs Clyed) You got a bug up your crack, you take it up with Razor."
MAG,"Until then you do as he says, and shut your hole, before I rip you a new one."
MAG,"Ah, screw this, let's get out of here. (they both turn away) Let's go hit some stores."
TARA,Doesn't sound like they found Willow and Xander.
ANYA,Did he say stores? Hitting stores? Does that mean looting?
TARA,"I think, I think the woods let out over this way (points) We should keep off the streets, take alleys if we can."
ANYA,"They can't loot the magic shop, not now! I just got it."
TARA,(puts hand on Anya's shoulder) Let's go.
ANYA,"You don't think they'll cause a lot of damage, do you?"
SPIKE,(OS) A couple of stakes...
SPIKE,"...holy water, one cross - (reaches in to grab the cross) Ow! (stumbles back, shaking his hand in pain) Brilliant."
SPIKE,Here! (starts toward her) You want me to bloody thump you? I told you to stay away from the window. (pulls her away)
DAWN,Who are they?
SPIKE,"(peers out) Hellions. Road pirates. (shot of a demon throwing rocks through a house's windows) They raid towns ... use 'em up, burn 'em down. It's usually backwaters, any place... (looks back at Dawn, realizing) Any place they think is vulnerable."
DAWN,They know. The Slayer's gone.
SPIKE,"Can't stay here. (gets up, grabs Dawn by the hand)"
DAWN,"W-well, I'm not going out there!"
SPIKE,"(pulling her toward the door) Got no choice, bit, I can't protect you here."
DAWN,"(stops) Well, we can lock the doors, turn out the lights."
SPIKE,"And what, hide under the bed linen? Not really my style."
DAWN,"But we need to wait for the others, and Buffy."
DAWN,"...bot. You know, the-the Buffybot."
DAWN,(agitated) We-we have to wait for the others-
SPIKE,"(grabs her roughly by the shoulders) Look! (pauses, more quietly) Dawn, I get that you're scared. But I'm your sitter, so mind me. (lets go her shoulders) I'm not gonna let any of those buggers lay so much as a warty digit on you. Right?"
DAWN,(whispers) Right.
SPIKE,"Right, then. We can't wait around to see if the others will pop in. We're on our own. No one's coming to our rescue."
