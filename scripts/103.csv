GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer...</I>
SPIKE,I love you.
BUFFY,The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
DAWN,"Buffy, no."
DAWN,No!
XANDER,You're talking about raising the dead. It feels wrong.
TARA,It is wrong.
WILLOW,She could be trapped!
WILLOW,I'm not gonna leave her there.
WILLOW,"Osiris, master of all fate, let her cross over."
WILLOW,Buffy?
ANYA,What's wrong with her?
WILLOW,She's in shock.
DAWN,Who are they?
SPIKE,"Road pirates. They raid towns, use 'em up, burn 'em down."
DAWN,"You're alive, and you're home. You're home."
WILLOW,"She's at home. She has to be. We're, we just need to get there, and she'll be there."
TARA,This is the fastest way?
XANDER,Absolutely.
TARA,You sure?
XANDER,"Hey, I've done a lot of fleeing on these mean streets. I know all the shortcuts."
ANYA,"I don't like this. (points to something they pass that's on fire) Look, fire. Fire is rarely a sign of imminent safety."
WILLOW,I wish we were there already.
XANDER,"Hey, hey, don't worry, ladies, I'll get us there just fine. My senses are primed for danger, and nothing's gonna-"
XANDER,(shaky) I'm okay. (pats himself) Four. Four limbs.
ANYA,"Well, at least the demons almost hit you on the way *out* of town."
XANDER,"Yeah, now that their leader's gone they seem to be making with the big skedaddle."
WILLOW,"(looks around nervously) I-it was Buffy, right? We, we saw her and it was really Buffy?"
ANYA,I think we screwed it up. She's broken.
WILLOW,"No! She's not broken! She's just .... disoriented from being ... tormented in some hell dimension. Probably tortured and ... It's like, we don't even know how much time has passed there for her, uh, possibly years. That's not something you just get over. Oh my God. What if she never gets over it?"
ANYA,And you think of this now?
TARA,"What are you thinking, Willow? That-that she's ... that she's not right, or, or maybe like, dangerous?"
DAWN,(nervous) Home! See?
DAWN,You're back home. We're all okay now.
BUFFY,Ow.
BUFFY,It's different.
DAWN,"A little. Uh, Willow and Tara live here now, and, uh, we ..."
DAWN,...we didn't do much...
DAWN,"We moved some of the chairs, and took out some of the little tables, but..."
DAWN,This is the same. Except the computer stuff.
DAWN,"That's Willow's, obviously. We eat at the other end..."
DAWN,"(softly, with self-disgust) Obviously."
DAWN,There you are. Knew you were under that dirt somewhere. (nervous laugh)
DAWN,"(false cheer) You remember what Mom used to say? ""Either wash that neck or plant potatoes."" (Buffy still doesn't react) Yeah, I never thought it was funny either."
DAWN,"You want to button that, or, um..."
DAWN,Ohh ... ow.
DAWN,"Um, we'll ... take care of that after."
BUFFY,Okay.
DAWN,"Here, I'll do the shirt. (begins buttoning the shirt) And then, then we'll do your hands."
DAWN,See how nice you look...
DAWN,Mom's room. (walks closer to Buffy) I know it's really different now.
BUFFY,Willow and Tara. This is their room.
DAWN,"Yeah, well, it seemed to make the most sense. No one was using it, and it's the biggest. But, you know, now that you're here, we'll have to figure out something to do."
DAWN,"(frustrated) Buffy? You wanna, like, stop? (hopeful) We can ... we can sit down and talk."
BUFFY,What else is different?
DAWN,"(sighs) Do you mean about the house, or..."
DAWN,"Um. Let's see ... Giles. It's so weird. He, he left today. Because you were ... (Buffy doesn't appear to react) He, he'll come right back, I'll call him. Someone'll call him."
BUFFY,What...
DAWN,What what?
BUFFY,"Uh ... What, um ... will you say to him?"
BUFFY,What's that?
DAWN,It's okay. It's okay.
SPIKE,(O.S.) Dawn! Dawn! Are you there?
DAWN,"(to Buffy) It, it's just Spike. (calls) I'm here!"
SPIKE,Thank God. You scared me half to death ... or more to death. You - I could kill you.
DAWN,Spike.
SPIKE,I mean it. I could rip your head off one-handed and drink from your brain stem.
DAWN,Look.
SPIKE,Yeah? I've seen the bloody bot before. Didn't think she'd patch up so-
DAWN,"She's kind of, um ... She's been through a lot ... with the ... death. But I think she's okay."
DAWN,Spike? Are *you* okay?
SPIKE,I'm ... what did you do?
DAWN,Me? Nothing.
SPIKE,Her hands.
DAWN,"Um, I was gonna fix 'em. I don't know how they got like that."
SPIKE,"I do. Clawed her way out of a coffin, that's how. (to Buffy) Isn't that right?"
BUFFY,(quietly) Yeah. That's ... what I had to do.
SPIKE,Done it myself.
SPIKE,Um ... We'll take care of you. Come here.
SPIKE,"(to Dawn) Get some stuff, uh, mercurochrome, bandages."
DAWN,Okay.
BUFFY,How long was I gone?
SPIKE,"Hundred forty-seven days yesterday. Uh ... hundred forty-eight today. (smiles a little) 'Cept today doesn't count, does it?"
SPIKE,How long was it for you ... where you were?
BUFFY,(pause) Longer.
DAWN,Got the stuff.
WILLOW,Is she here?
ANYA,She's here!
WILLOW,You're here.
XANDER,We didn't know where you were.
ANYA,You ran away.
WILLOW,Buffy!
TARA,Are you okay?
DAWN,(shocked)You knew she was back?
DAWN,How did you know?
ANYA,"(to Buffy) You're not a zombie, are you?"
XANDER,Anya!
WILLOW,Are you in pain?
XANDER,What do you remember?
TARA,What do you know about what happened?
DAWN,Hey! Back off!
DAWN,You did this. What did you do?
WILLOW,"A spell. We, we did a spell."
ANYA,"We didn't think it worked, but-"
DAWN,Is she going to be okay?
BUFFY,I'm okay.
Everyone looks at Buffy. Shot of the Scoobies from her perspective,"towering over her, looking a little menacing."
BUFFY,I'm gonna be fine. I remember. You brought me back.
ANYA,What was it like?
BUFFY,"I, I can't..."
XANDER,"It's okay. You don't have to talk about this, Buff. Hey, do you want something? Anything. Pizza. I'll get you pizza."
ANYA,Buffy likes pizza.
TARA,"Yeah, something to eat-"
WILLOW,She doesn't want pizza.
TARA,I just meant-
DAWN,(sharply) Guys! Back off.
WILLOW,"Right, uh, Dawn's right. We should just be quiet, and let Buffy tell us what she needs."
BUFFY,"I, I think I ... just wanna go to sleep."
TARA,"That's a good idea. You, you should sleep."
WILLOW,"Right. Long day. But, Buffy ... be happy. (big smile) We got you out. We really did it."
BUFFY,(apologetically) Tired.
ANYA,"Well, yeah. I mean ... jet-lag from hell has gotta be, you know, jet-lag from hell."
BUFFY,(toward Dawn) My room is still...
DAWN,Yeah. Yes. It's your room.
WILLOW,"(defensively) Well, she, she's fine! Normal! She used to go to bed all the time!"
Cut to,"exterior Summers house, night. Anya and Xander come out, cross the porch and begin down the stairs."
ANYA,I think Willow's wrong. I don't think she's particularly normal at all.
XANDER,"Well, she just got back. Give it time. I bet in a week she'll be our little Bufferin again."
ANYA,"Oh yes, cause six or seven days, that's all you really need to get over eternal hell experiences."
XANDER,Who's that? Spike?
XANDER,What are you doing out here? I hope you're not going to start your little obsession now that she's around again.
ANYA,Hey!
SPIKE,You didn't tell me. You brought her back and you didn't tell me.
XANDER,"Well, now you know."
SPIKE,I worked beside you all summer.
XANDER,"We didn't tell you. It was just ... we didn't, okay?"
SPIKE,Listen. I've figured it out.
SPIKE,"(angrily) Maybe you haven't, but I have."
SPIKE,"Willow knew there was a chance that she'd come back wrong. So wrong that you'd have ... that she would have to get rid of what came back. And I wouldn't let her. If any part of that was Buffy, I wouldn't let her. And that's why she shut me out."
XANDER,What are you talking about? Willow wouldn't do that.
SPIKE,(sarcastic) Oh. Is that right.
XANDER,"Look. You're just covering. Don't tell me you're not happy. (Spike scoffs) Look me in the eyes, and tell me when you saw Buffy alive, that wasn't the happiest moment of your entire existence."
SPIKE,(as he walks) That's the thing about magic. There's always consequences.
SPIKE,Always!
WILLOW,Hey.
TARA,Did you get through to London?
WILLOW,"Yeah. He's gonna head back as soon as he can. I'm not sure, like maybe a couple days."
TARA,"(stops brushing hair, turns to Willow) How did he take it?"
WILLOW,"(rubbing lotion on her arms) Um ... I'm not sure. I mean ... glad, but ... kinda weirded out, which I get, you know? Lots of ""dear lords"". And I think I actually heard him cleaning his glasses."
TARA,Are you worried?
WILLOW,"Worried? Tara, it worked fine. (not convincingly) It's all good."
TARA,"(gets into bed) Hey, Will, this is me. It doesn't all have to be ""good"" and ""fine."" This is the room where you don't have to be brave. I still love you. If you're worried you can be worried."
WILLOW,"Well ... I'm not ... unworried. I mean, what, what happened, that was intense. (closes the door) That's ... gotta change you."
WILLOW,When Angel came back ... Buffy said ... he was wild. Like an animal.
TARA,Buffy's not like that.
WILLOW,Yeah.
TARA,But?
WILLOW,"(points at her head) It's just kinda ... noisy up here tonight, you know?"
TARA,Yeah.
TARA,Is this better?
WILLOW,(smiles) Yeah. I think it makes things quieter in here.
TARA,You know what I think? I think we all just assumed crash positions.
WILLOW,Huh?
TARA,"It's, it's, it's like ... we were all tensed up, like ... we were expecting it to screw up. We weren't prepared for it to ... actually go right."
WILLOW,Yeah.
WILLOW,Tara?
TARA,Yeah?
WILLOW,"If things did go right ... wouldn't you think she'd be ... happier? Like, wouldn't you think she would be so happy that we brought her out?"
TARA,Sure she is.
TARA,You thought she'd say thanks. Be more grateful.
WILLOW,Would I be a terrible person if I said yes?
TARA,Give her time. She'll get there.
WILLOW,Right. No need to be in a big furry hurry.
TARA,Exactly.
TARA VOICEOVER,I'm sure it's okay.
Suddenly the images change,all the flesh melts away and the smiling faces become dead skeleton faces.
WILLOW,Buffy?
BUFFY,"(low hoarse voice) What did you do? Do you know what you did? You're like children. (Willow and Tara sitting up in bed staring in fear) Your hands smell of death. Bitches! Filthy little bitches, rattling the bones. Did you cut the throat? Did you pat its head?"
BUFFY,"(shouts) The blood dried on your hands, didn't it?"
TARA,"Oh my god, oh my god."
BUFFY,(shouts) You were stained. You still are. I know what you did!
TARA,The glass. There's no glass.
WILLOW,"(quietly) Okay, what in the frilly heck is going on?"
TARA,Maybe we dreamed it.
WILLOW,(closing the door) Right. Right. Wrong! (points at her head) Different brains.
TARA,Oh yeah.
TARA,Well ... what was it talking about? Did you understand it?
WILLOW,"Well, I understood the words, but ... no."
WILLOW,What was that?
TARA,"There's, there's something in the house."
WILLOW,What is it after? Is it ... Buffy?
TARA,I don't know.
WILLOW,"That's it, I'm gonna call. (grabs the phone) I hope Xander's up."
ANYA,"Xander, are you up? I can't sleep. (pause, no response) Play a word game with me."
ANYA,"Xander, are you awake? Okay, I'm going to describe an adjective with accurate but misleading clues, and then you have to guess what it is. (pause) Xander? (pokes him) Xander?"
XANDER,Huh? What? Do what?
ANYA,"(exasperated, lies back) That oughta do it."
XANDER,(into phone) Hello?
WILLOW,"(on phone) Xander, it's me, Willow. (Anya gets out of bed, walks off) We were just attacked."
XANDER,Attacked? A vampire?
WILLOW,"No, it was Buffy. Or something that looked like her."
TARA,(on phone) Like she was possessed.
WILLOW,"And then she just disappeared, a-and, and we saw something... a little ... there's something in the house."
XANDER,"(slurred) In the house? All right, Willow, you need to get out of there, just get everyone out."
XANDER,(into phone) Wake up Buffy and Dawn. Don't make a big deal-
XANDER,Gah!
XANDER,Anya!
XANDER,Anya!
WILLOW,(on phone) Xander? Xander!
XANDER,"Very bad. Very, very, very bad. Bad."
ANYA,(to Willow and Tara) He's all traumatized.
WILLOW,"Well, whatever it is, it's not the, the traditional haunting, because i-it's not limited to one specific place, and there's not, you know, a dead person."
TARA,Not any more.
ANYA,I bet it's a hitchhiker.
XANDER,A hitchhiker?
ANYA,"Um, standard way to travel through dimensions. Uh, some demon-thing sees someone moving between worlds, and grabs on for the ride."
WILLOW,"You mean like, some hell-beastie rode in with Buffy? Like ... we're responsible for this?"
TARA,Assume crash positions.
ANYA,I think we shouldn't've brought Buffy back. I knew it was going to end badly. I should've said something.
XANDER,"Okay, fine, but ... what are we gonna do? I mean, I'm feeling the need for some vigorous doing, you know?"
WILLOW,"It's okay. We, we just kill the beastie and then all is good. We're rolling in puppies! ... Right?"
XANDER,Can we do that? Kill it?
BUFFY,(OS) We killing something?
WILLOW,Buffy! You're not supposed to be up.
TARA,"How, how are you feeling? Are you okay?"
BUFFY,So what are we killing?
ANYA,A demon you brought back from Hell with you. (Willow gives her an angry look)
BUFFY,Oh.
WILLOW,"It's not like she's making it sound. A little haunting-type stuff. Boo-scary, everything's normal."
TARA,You shouldn't worry about it.
BUFFY,"Um, I remember something, last ... night, uh..."
XANDER,Buff?
BUFFY,(snaps out of it) Um ... the photographs. O-of us. They changed.
TARA,How did they change?
BUFFY,"They were ... dead. I-I-I mean, we were dead. Like, um ... dead bodies? But, but then they were okay. So I just, you know, figured it was me. That I was going crazy."
ANYA,"Well, maybe you are. Going crazy. From Hell."
ANYA,(fake scoff) No. You're fine.
WILLOW,"You are. And Buffy, we're, we're so glad."
XANDER,"Yeah. This thing, this haunting thing, we'll fix it, and then we'll still have you back, which is ... it's so important."
WILLOW,Yes.
TARA,It's wonderful.
BUFFY,We should get to work.
Cut to,"interior magic shop. We see Willow, Tara, Xander, and Anya sitting around the table looking at books. Willow is writing. Dawn stands behind Willow, looking over her shoulder."
DAWN,What's the list?
ANYA,Possible hitchhikers.
XANDER,Demons that might have come out of Hell at the same time Buffy did.
DAWN,"(reads) ""Skaggmore demons, Trellbane demons, Skitterers, Large and Small Bone-Eaters"" ... If we get to pick, I say we go with the Small Bone-Eaters."
ANYA,"Well, that just means they prefer to eat things with small bones, like you."
WILLOW,"That's just what we have so far. Five species of demons that have been known to move transdimensionally. Two of them may be invisible in this dimension, and, uh, two others can perform spells to alter perception."
ANYA,"Well, that's four. What's the other one like?"
TARA,"Uh, like the others, only dripping with viscous fluid."
DAWN,Eww.
XANDER,"So, should we concentrate on how to kill those, or should we try to find more?"
WILLOW,"I'm not sure. Maybe ... maybe some of us can, uh, keep going finding more, and the others--"
BUFFY,I miss Giles.
WILLOW,"Oh. He's coming back, I talked to him. I know I'm a kind of poor substitute, but until then, we'll get it done."
BUFFY,I think I should patrol.
WILLOW,"Well, I know we'll find something soon."
BUFFY,Yeah.
XANDER,"Uh, do you want us to go with you?"
ANYA,We can do that.
BUFFY,No. I-I need to go. Sorry.
DAWN,You should go.
DAWN,(OS) I'll be safe here with the others. Don't worry about me.
ANYA,"I found one of those 24-hour places for coffee. Remember that bookstore? Well they became one of those books-and-coffee places, and now they're just coffee. It's like evolution, only without the getting-better part."
ANYA,"Uh, coffee, coffee, coffee, um, hot chocolate for Dawn. (to Dawn) You're too young for coffee."
DAWN,Idiot.
ANYA,You can have my coffee.
DAWN,(low hoarse voice) All of you did it. You stupid children. (the other all staring at her) Did you think the blood wouldn't reach you? I smell the death on you. Look at what you've done!
XANDER,Fire! Fire! Fire!
TARA,Dawn!
WILLOW,"Oh my god, oh my god."
WILLOW,"That was it. Li-like Buffy, with fire."
XANDER,Is she okay?
ANYA,Did I look like that? I hope I didn't look like that.
WILLOW,"No, I'm sure you looked really glamorous cutting up your face."
DAWN,What ... what is it? What's happening?
WILLOW,You'll be okay.
ANYA,I bet you'll experience some dry-mouth. (they all look at her) Fire.
DAWN,Was it ... did the demon thing have me?
TARA,It's okay. It's okay.
XANDER,Yeah. It's gone.
ANYA,"Yes, but where did it go? I mean, evil things have plans. They have things to do."
Cut to: interior of Spike's crypt. We're in the lower level. Spike paces back and forth restlessly. We see that there's more furniture now,"a chair, a bookcase with a lamp on it, etc."
SPIKE,Buffy.
SPIKE,(quietly) You should be careful. Never know what kind of villain's got a knife at your back.
BUFFY,Your hand is hurt.
SPIKE,Hmm. (nods toward her hands) Same with you.
BUFFY,(looks down at her hands) Right.
SPIKE,"Willow's getting pretty strong, isn't she? Bringing you back. It's hard to get a good night's death around here."
SPIKE,You can sit down. Got furniture.
SPIKE,"You should see the downstairs, too, it's quite posh."
SPIKE,Uh ... I do remember what I said. The promise. To protect her. (pause) If I had done that ... even if I didn't make it ... you wouldn't have had to jump.
SPIKE,"But I want you to know I did save you. Not when it counted, of course, but ... after that. Every night after that. I'd see it all again ... do something different. Faster or more clever, you know? Dozens of times, lots of different ways ... (softly) Every night I save you."
Cut to,"interior magic shop. Xander stands by the window, peering through the blinds. Tara comes over."
XANDER,It's getting light out. Buffy's probably on her way home from patrolling.
TARA,"I like sunrise better when I'm getting up early than when I'm staying up late, you know? It's like ... I'm seeing it from the wrong side."
XANDER,"(nervous) Hey, Tara, this is probably crazy ... but Spike got me to thinking. This spell we did ... it's having consequences, isn't it? I mean ... it sure seems like it. And I was just wondering ... did you know that this might happen?"
TARA,No!
XANDER,Do you think ... could someone have known?
TARA,"Willow is a talented witch, and she would never do anything to hurt anyone."
XANDER,"I know, I know, huh? (raises his hands) Backing off quickly, hands in the air. (sighs) I just meant-"
WILLOW,Thaumogenesis!
ANYA,She's possessed!
WILLOW,Thaumogenesis.
DAWN,(to Anya) You're right.
WILLOW,"I'm not possessed. I-I think I figured it out. This demon, i-it's not a demon we let out. It's, it's a demon that we made."
XANDER,We made a demon? Bad us.
WILLOW,"Thaumogenesis is when doing a spell actually creates a being. In this case it was like, a, a side-effect, I guess. Like a price."
DAWN,What?
WILLOW,"Think of it like, the world doesn't like you getting something for free, and we asked for this huge gift. Buffy. A-and so the world said, 'fine, but if you have that, you have to take this too.' And it made the demon."
ANYA,"Well, technically, that's not a price. That's a gift with purchase."
DAWN,"Um, but, if we made the demon, how come we can't see it? I mean, all we see is us. Doing stuff."
WILLOW,"Well, I, I think it's out of phase with this dimension. Like, its consciousness is here, but, but its body is caught in the ether between existing and not existing."
TARA,"It doesn't have a body, so it's borrowing ours. I-it borrowed Dawn and Anya..."
WILLOW,"Or, or it's manifesting copies of them, like, like it did when Buffy came at us..."
TARA,"It's using them to do stuff. To scare us, attack us."
XANDER,"So we need to uncreate it, right? We need to send it the rest of the way out of our world."
WILLOW,"Uh-huh. Except that ... it's linked to the spell. So, if we sent it away ... it would be like the spell doesn't exist. Like it never happened."
DAWN,Like it never brought Buffy back.
WILLOW,(softly) Yes.
DAWN,You can't do that. (stands) You can't think for a second that you're going to do that.
TARA,Dawn-
DAWN,If you think you can give her back to me and then take her away again? No. That's worse than if you'd never brought her back. You can't mess with people's lives this way!
WILLOW,"Dawn, we're not going to do it that way."
DAWN,(to the others) How can you let her do this? How can you even talk about letting her go?
TARA,"Honey, you're not listening. She said we will find another way."
XANDER,We will.
DAWN,Then do it!
WILLOW,Wait. Wait. Dawn. Everybody hold on. (smiles)
ANYA,What? Why are you smiling? That's inappropriate.
WILLOW,Because it's temporary.
XANDER,What is?
WILLOW,The demon. I-it's gonna dissipate. The only way for it to survive on this plane is if it were to kill the subject of the original spell.
TARA,It would live if it killed Buffy?
WILLOW,That's not gonna-
XANDER,Thanks for the tip.
Cut to,"interior of the Summers house, night. Buffy opens the door and comes in, puts her keys on the table, starts up the stairs. Behind her, we see a white mist. It slowly coalesces into a vaguely human shape, reaching out arms toward Buffy as it moves up the stairs after her."
DEMON,(whispery voice) You don't belong here.
DEMON,"(O.S.) Did they tell you, you belonged here?"
DEMON,Did they say this was your home again?
DEMON,"Were you offered pretty lies, little girl?"
DEMON,Or did they even give you a choice?
DAWN,Xander! Drive faster!
XANDER,I can't!
DAWN,I could drive faster and I can't drive!
ANYA,"She's right, you're like a snail. A snail who's driving a car very slowly. Come on, give it the lead foot! We've got to help Buffy with that demon you sent after her!"
XANDER,"I did not send the demon, I was possessed. The demon used me to eavesdrop on our conversation."
ANYA,"Great, so now what? We have to talk in some sort of anti-demon secret code?"
XANDER,"Ood-gay idea-yay, An-yay."
DAWN,Stop talking wrong in Pig Latin and drive! Buffy's in trouble!
XANDER,"It's okay, Dawnie. Willow and Tara are doing a spell."
DAWN,You sure it won't send Buffy back?
XANDER,"No, of course not. It's just that she can't fight this thing if it's all ... misty, so they make it more solid, so Buffy can kick its fully embodied ass."
DAWN,You sure it'll work?
WILLOW/TARA,"Child of words, hear thy makers. Child of words, we entreat. With our actions did we make thee, to our voices wilt thou bend."
WILLOW/TARA,"With our potions thou took motive, with our motions came to pass. We rescind no past devotions, give thee substance, give thee mass."
DEMON,You're the one who's barely here. Set on this earth like a bubble.
DEMON,You won't even disturb the air when you go.
BUFFY,Go! Take Dawn out of here!
TARA,"Child of words, hear thy makers. Child of words, we en...treat..."
WILLOW,Solid.
DAWN,"(to Xander) That's probably the sort of thing I'm not supposed to see, right?"
Cut to,"overhead shot of Sunnydale, day."
Cut to,"exterior shot of the Summers house. It's a bright sunny day, birds chirping, etc."
BUFFY,Dawn!
DAWN,(alarmed) What's wrong?
BUFFY,Lunch.
DAWN,(smiling happily) You made me lunch? (takes the lunchbag) Wow. Thanks.
BUFFY,(solemn) You better go. You've been out since ... I got back. And you know what they say. Those of us who fail history? Doomed to repeat it in summer school.
DAWN,(whispers) Thank you.
DAWN,Are you okay?
BUFFY,I'm going to start charging money for every person that asks me that.
DAWN,"Everyone's been doing that, huh?"
BUFFY,A little bit.
DAWN,It's because they care about you a lot. When you were gone ... it was bad when you were gone. But it'll be better now. Now that they can see you being happy. (pause) That's all they want.
Cut to,"interior magic shop. Tara is sitting on a chair and Willow standing, both putting books on shelves. The door bell jingles. Willow turns and smiles."
WILLOW,Buffy! Hey!
XANDER,"Hey, you get Dawn off to school all right? 'Cause I was thinking, if you need help picking her up, I..."
BUFFY,"It's okay. I got it. (nervous) Look, you guys, um, there's this thing ... so I'm just gonna say it."
BUFFY,"You brought me back. I was in a ... I was in hell. I, um ... I can't think too much about what it was like. But it felt like the world abandoned me there. And then suddenly ... you guys did what you did."
TARA,It was Willow. She knew what to do. (Willow looks embarrassed)
BUFFY,Okay. So you did that. And the world came rushing back. Thank you. You guys gave me the world. I can't tell you what it means to me.
BUFFY,And I should have said it before.
WILLOW,(tearful) You're welcome.
XANDER,"Welcome home, Buffy."
SPIKE,Buffy.
BUFFY,"(frowns) Spike, it's daylight and you're-"
SPIKE,"Not on fire? (looks at the sky) Sun's low enough, shady enough here."
SPIKE,"I was gonna go inside, but I overheard you and the Super-friends exchanging a special moment and I came over a bit queasy."
SPIKE,"Say, aren't you leaving a hole in the middle of some soggy group hug?"
BUFFY,Just wanted a little time alone.
SPIKE,"Oh, uh, right then."
BUFFY,That's okay. I can be alone with you here.
SPIKE,Thanks ever so.
BUFFY,Right.
SPIKE,Buff? ... Slayer? Are you okay?
BUFFY,I'm here. I'm good.
SPIKE,"(walks back to her) Buffy, if you're in ... if you're in pain ... or if you need anything... or if I can do anything for you..."
BUFFY,(looks down at her lap) You can't.
SPIKE,"Well, I haven't been to a hell dimension just of late, but I do know a thing or two about torment."
BUFFY,(still looking down) I was happy.
BUFFY,Wherever I ... was ... I was happy. At peace.
BUFFY,"I knew that everyone I cared about was all right. I knew it. Time ... didn't mean anything ... nothing had form ... but I was still me, you know? (glances at him, then away) And I was warm ... and I was loved ... and I was finished. Complete. I don't understand about theology or dimensions, or ... any of it, really ... but I think I was in heaven."
BUFFY,"And now I'm not. (almost tearful) I was torn out of there. Pulled out ... by my friends. (Spike continues staring, listening) Everything here is ... hard, and bright, and violent. Everything I feel, everything I touch ... this is Hell. Just getting through the next moment, and the one after that ... (softly) knowing what I've lost..."
BUFFY,They can never know. Never.
