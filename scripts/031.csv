Lyrics,<I>The way you love / Have you got a name for it / Cause I don't  understand it</I>
Lyrics,<I>The language is an annoying necessity / And I depend on all the  regular things</I>
Lyrics,<I>Got a list tattooed on my memory / Of how our tryst should  unfold</I>
Lyrics,<I>I'm falling from the opposite</I>
Ben,Hey.
Lyrics,<I>What good is it</I>
Ben,I'm Ben. We had Algebra II together last year.
Lyrics,<I>Fight the map with no key attached</I>
Buffy,"Sorry, I pretty much repress anything math-related."
Lyrics,"<I>My heart's enlarged, and I charge / What do you say</I>"
Ben,Ms. Jackson? Second period? You sat in the seat three over and one  behind.
Lyrics,<I>To a dream that won't go away</I>
Buffy,"Oh! Yeah, I remember now, it's the one with the desks and the  chalkboards and pencils and stuff, right?"
Ben,That's the one. (chuckles)
Buffy,(smiles and points at her head) Like a steel trap.
Lyrics,<I>'Cause I don't know if I can stand it</I>
Ben,"So, I was wondering, you know the dance tomorrow night? Are you  going?"
Buffy,You mean the Sadie Hawkins thing? The deal where the girls ask  the boys?
Ben,Yeah.
Lyrics,<I>Forever isn't something you want to be</I>
Ben,"And I thought maybe, you know, if you're free, you might ask me."
Lyrics,<I>And I rely on familiar things</I>
Buffy,"Oh, gosh... (exhales) I..."
Ben,"(holds up his hand) Oh, oh, hey, hey, no, don't, don't worry about  it..."
Buffy,"No, no, you seem like a really great guy, it's..."
Lyrics,<I>Seven days all have special meanings</I>
Buffy,...me. I-I'm not seeing anybody.
Lyrics,<I>But you just call it a week</I>
Buffy,"Ever again, actually."
Ben,"Oh. That's, that's too bad."
Lyrics,<I>I'm falling from the opposite / What good is it</I>
Ben,"Okay, well, I better... (indicates away and goes)"
Lyrics,<I>Fight the map with no key attached</I>
Buffy,(to herself) Sorry.
Lyrics,"<I>My heart's enlarged, and I charge</I>"
Lyrics,"<I>I'm falling from the opposite / What good is it / Fight the map  with no key attached / My heart's enlarged, and I charge</I>"
Willow,Hey! You're bailing?
Buffy,"Yeah. I'm gonna stop by the library and see if Giles wants me to  patrol, and then sack it."
Willow,"You've been doing that a lot. Patrolling and sacking. In fact,  you've kind of been All-Work-And-No-Play Buffy."
Buffy,"I play. I have *big* fun. I came here tonight, didn't I?"
Willow,"You came, you saw, you (glances up) rejected."
Buffy,You mean that guy? Just not in date mode right now.
Willow,"(smiles) Well, maybe you need to date to get in date mode."
Buffy,"I don't think I'm ready for that, Will."
Willow,You're thinking too much. Maybe you need to be impulsive.  (smiles)
Buffy,"Impulsive? Do you remember my ex-boyfriend, the vampire? I slept  with him, he lost his soul, now my boyfriend's gone forever, and the  demon that wears his face is killing my friends. The next impulsive  decision I make will involve my choice of dentures."
Willow,"Okay, the Angel thing went badly, I'm on board with that, but  that's not your fault. And anyways, love isn't always like that. Love  can be... (smiles) nice!"
Boy,(angrily) Come back here! We're not finished!
Boy,"You don't care anymore, is that it?"
Girl,"(sobbing) No, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what I feel."
Boy,Then tell me you don't love me. (shakes her) Say it!
Girl,Will that help? Is that what you need to hear? I don't. I don't!  Now let me go. (tries to go)
Boy,No! A person doesn't just wake up one day and stop loving  somebody.
Boy,Love is forever.
Boy,I'm not afraid to use it. I swear! If I can't be with you...
Buffy,Hey!
Girl,"Oh, my God!"
Boy,"DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME, BITCH!"
Boy,What happened?
Buffy,What happened?! You just went O.J. on your girlfriend!
Boy,This is nuts! I... I don't know why I got so mad.
Buffy,Because you're a jerk?
Girl,He's not. We weren't even fighting a few minutes ago.
Boy,"We weren't, I, I swear to God!"
Buffy,"If you weren't fighting, then why'd you have a gun?"
Boy,"I don't, I don't know. I don't even know where I got it."
George,I don't see any gun.
Snyder,I'm sure you know why I asked you here.
Buffy,To thank me?
Snyder,"(walks around his desk) That's right, I wanna thank you. What  would Sunnydale High do without you around to incite mayhem, chaos and  disorder?"
Buffy,"I don't incite! I stopped that boy from killing his girlfriend,  ask him. Ask the janitor."
Snyder,"People can be coerced, Summers. I'm no stranger to conspiracy.  I saw JFK. I'm a truth seeker. I've got a missing gun and two confused  kids on my hands. Pieces of the puzzle. And I'm gonna look at all the  pieces carefully and rationally, and I'm gonna keep looking until I know  exactly how this is all your fault."
Secretary,"Mr. Snyder, Billy Crandal chained himself to the snack  machine again."
Snyder,(to the intercom) Pathetic little no-life vegan.
Snyder,"Not so fast, missy. I'm not done with you yet. You stink of  lies."
Willow,"So, for next time read the chapters on information grouping and  binary coding."
Willow,"I bet you'll think coding is pretty cool. I mean, if you find  two-digit, multi-stacked conversions and primary number clusters a big  hoot."
Willow,"Giles! (goes to him) I made them laugh, did you hear? I did the  joke thing! (smiles) (goes back to the desk)"
Giles,"Yes, yes, so it seems. I-I mean, um, (approaches the desk) uh,  you did indeed. Good, good, good show. I-I-I just stopped by to, to see  if you needed any assistance, (sits on the desk) but you seem to have  things quite under control."
Willow,"(puts things away) Well, I had good lesson plans. Ms. Calendar  had them on her computer."
Giles,"Yes, yes, she was very, um... uh, dedicated."
Willow,And I found a bunch of files and Internet sites on paganism and  magic and stuff. (smiles)
Giles,Oh?
Willow,"Yes, it's really interesting."
Willow,"(reaches for something on the desk) And, uh, I found this in  her drawer. (Giles looks up) She told me it was a rose quartz. (Giles  looks at her hands) And it has healing powers."
Willow,I thought she'd want you to have it.
Giles,"Oh, thank you, Willow, that's, um... that's very thoughtful of  you."
Teacher,"Before 1935, the new deal focused on revitalizing stricken  business and agricultural communities. And the new deal also tried to  regulate the nation's financial hierarchy to avoid another disaster like  the 1929 stock market crash."
James,I like it. Very much. It's honest.
Teacher,"...hours, child labor..."
Teacher,...and collective bargaining.
Teacher,"Oh, my God!"
Boy,(smiling) Did you see what he wrote?
Buffy,"I'm telling you, something weird is going on."
Xander,Something weird is going on. Isn't that our school motto?
Buffy,Pretty much. But I don't know. This time it bugs me.
Xander,"I don't wanna poo-poo your wiggins, but a domestic dispute, a  little case of chalkboard Tourette's? All sounds like Hellmouth Lite to  me."
Willow,"Xander, what happened? Did Cordelia win another round in the  broom closet?"
Xander,"You're just a big bucket of funny, Will."
Xander,"I'll have you know I was just accosted by some kind of, um,  locker monster."
Giles,(looks up) Loch Ness Monster?
Buffy,"'Locker' monster is what he said. But it wasn't really a  monster. It was, like, this big arm that came out of the locker, but  then we opened it again, it was gone. Nothing."
Xander,This was right after Buffy's history teacher starts doing some  freaky channeling thing in class.
Giles,(stands up) Ooh! Sounds like paranormal phenomena.
Willow,(smiles) A ghost? Cool!
Xander,"Oh, no, no. No. No cool. This was no wimpy chain rattler. This  was 'I'm dead as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore.'"
Giles,"Well, despite the Xander-speak, that's a fairly accurate  definition of a poltergeist."
Xander,I defined something? Accurately? (closes a book on the table)  Guess I'm done with the book learning. (sits)
Buffy,So we have some bad boo on our hands?
Giles,Yes.
Willow,"Well, why is it here? Does it just wanna scare people?"
Giles,"Unfortunately, he doesn't know exactly what he wants. That's,  that's the trouble. See, uh, many times the spirit is plagued by all  manner of worldly troubles. Being dead, it has no way to, uh, to make  its peace. So it, it lashes out, growing ever more confused, ever more  angry."
Buffy,"So it's a normal teenager, only dead."
Willow,"Well, what can we do? Is there any way to stop it?"
Giles,"(sits on the table) Uh, the only tried and true way is to work  out what unresolved issues keep it here, and-and-and, um, resolve them."
Buffy,Fabulous. Now we're Dr. Laura for the deceased.
Giles,Only if we can find out who this spirit is. (considers) Or was.
George,Working late Ms. Frank?
George,"Oh, yes ma'am. You go ahead."
George,"You too. Drive safe. (looks up at her) Oh, Ms. Frank?"
George,(drops his mop and approaches her) You can't make me disappear  just because you say it's over.
George,Is that what this is about? What other people think?
George,I don't give a damn about a normal life! I'm going crazy not  seeing you. I think about you every minute.
George,(angrily) Come back here! We're not finished yet!
George,You don't care anymore? Is that it?
George,Then tell me you don't love me. (shakes her) Say it!
George,No. A person doesn't just wake up one day and stop loving  somebody.
George,Love is forever.
George,I'm not afraid to use it. I swear. If I can't be with you...
George,"DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME, BITCH!"
Voice,I need you.
Giles,Jenny.
George,Don't!
George,"Don't do that, damn it! Don't talk to me like I'm some dumb..."
George,What's going on?
Giles,What's going on? You just shot a woman.
Angelus,And this... this is the garden.
Drusilla,Wow! (walks through) Look. Jasmine. (holds a flower)
Angelus,Night blooming. (plays with some pruning shears)
Drusilla,"Like us. Oh, Angel, it's fairyland. (turns in excitement)  Ooh!"
Spike,"(still at the entrance) It's paradise. Big windows, lovely  gardens. It'll be perfect when we want the sunlight to kill us."
Angelus,"If you don't like it, Spike, hit the stairs and go. Take a  stand, man. (comes up behind Drusilla)"
Spike,"Well, our old place was just fine till you went and had it  burned down."
Angelus,"(walks around the center stone table) Things change, Spikey.  You gotta roll with the punches. Well, actually, you pretty much got  that part down, haven't you?"
Spike,"Very funny, mate."
Angelus,"(peeks his head out from behind Dru) What can I say? (peeks  from the other side of her head) I just love to see you smile, buddy."
Spike,"Yeah, you're a giver. (turns and rolls out)"
Giles,"It was just as with the, the couple you encountered the other  night, Buffy. The, the janitor remembered everything. He, he knew he'd  killed this poor woman, but he had no idea why. Well, they-they had no  intimate relationship."
Willow,What about the gun? Did you find it?
Giles,"No, no. The police, everybody, we-we-we-we searched high and  low. I think it's very clear what's happening here."
Xander,"Fill me in then, 'cause I've read the book, seen the movie, and  I'm still fuzzy about what's going on."
Giles,It's Jenny.
Buffy,What?
Xander,You think she's the ghost?
Giles,"Well, don't you see? Well, she-she-she died here under tragic  circumstances, a-a-and now she's trapped."
Willow,"But what about the gun? I mean, Angel didn't shoot Ms.  Calendar."
Giles,The gun is insignificant. It's the violence of the thing that  matters. (goes back into his office)
Buffy,"I don't know. These fights these couples keep having, it's sort  of... specific."
Willow,She's right. It's a pattern that doesn't fit with the way Ms.  Calendar died.
Giles,"(comes out of his office) Yes, well, I, uh, I appreciate your  thoughts on the matter, I, in fact I... well, I *encourage* you to, to  always, uh, challenge me, uh, when you feel it's appropriate. You should  never be cowed by authority. (starts back in, but comes back) Except, of  course, in this instance, when I am clearly right and you are clearly  wrong. (goes back in)"
Willow,This is freaky. I don't ever remember ever seeing Giles be this  weird.
Xander,I know. He's usually Investigate-Things-From-Every-Boring-Angle  Guy. Now he's I-Cling-Onto-My-One-Lame-Idea Guy. What gives?
Buffy,He misses her. He can't think. Just a little more fallout from  my love life.
Willow,"Okay, but this ghost stuff is something else. Let me do a  crosscheck on other shootings at the school."
Buffy,"Yeah, we need some alternate ghost theories. What do we know?"
Xander,Dog spit is cleaner than human.
Buffy,Besides that?
Willow,"(finds something) Oh, boy, we know plenty."
Willow,"It says a student murdered a teacher on the night of the Sadie  Hawkins Dance. The rumor was they were having an affair, and she tried  to break it off. After he killed her, he went into the music room and  shot himself."
Xander,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a ghost. It is one of those two,  right?"
Willow,"It all fits: the gun, the Sadie Hawkins Dance."
Buffy,Which is tonight.
Xander,How come we've never heard about this murder-suicide thing  before? When did it happen?
Buffy,1955.
Willow,How did you know?
Buffy,"Okay, here's the new strangeness. I dreamt about this woman,  (points) Grace Newman, the other day. (turns more pages) Her and this  guy. (points)"
Willow,Jim Stanley? He's the one. He did it.
Xander,"Your dreams are getting wicked accurate, Buff. You wouldn't  happen to see me coming across some big cash? Or possibly knowing the  love of a woman? In a full body sense?"
Buffy,"(ignores him) He couldn't make her love him, so he killed her.  (turns away) Sicko. (steps away)"
Willow,"He looks so normal on this picture. He was smart, too. He made  the honor roll."
Buffy,(looks back) Smart.
Xander,He killed a person and killed himself. Those are pretty much  two of the dumbest things you could do.
Willow,"I know, but... Well, don't you feel kind of bad for them?"
Buffy,Sure I feel lousy. For her. He's a murderer and he should pay  for it.
Willow,With his life?
Buffy,"No, he should be doing sixty years in a prison, breaking rocks  and making special friends with Roscoe the Weightlifter."
Xander,Yikes. The quality of mercy is not Buffy.
Willow,Whose ghost do you think we're dealing with? His or hers?
Buffy,"Well, considering how violent it is, I'm gonna say his."
Xander,That tracks.
Willow,"(sits) Well, I've been browsing on some of Ms. Calendar's pagan  sites. Maybe I can find a way to communicate with them and... we can  find out what he wants."
Buffy,Who cares what he wants? We need to shut him down before some  other innocent guy goes and kills some poor nice girl and then blows his  brains out all over the music room wall.
Xander,Okay! (smiles and rubs his hands) Who's hungry?
Cordelia,"I hope you guys aren't going to the Sadie Hawkins Dance  tonight, (sits) 'cause I'm organizing a boycott. Do you realize that the  girls have to ask the guys? And pay and everything? I mean, whose genius  idea was that?"
Xander,"Obviously, some hairy-legged feminist."
Cordelia,"Really! Well, we need to nip this thing in the bud. I mean,  otherwise, things are going to get really scary."
Cordelia,Perfect. I'm gonna be scarred and swollen. Why didn't they  just kill me?
Chief,Schoolboy pranks?
Snyder,Never sell. (slams the door and they walk)
Chief,The sewer got backed up.
Snyder,Better. I can probably make that one fly. But this is getting  out of hand. People will talk.
Chief,You'll take care of it.
Snyder,"I'm doing everything I can, but you people have to realize..."
Man,"Snyder, what's going on here?"
Snyder,Backed up sewer line. Same thing happened in San Diego just  last week.
Snyder,"(to the Chief) We're on a Hellmouth. Sooner or later, people  are gonna figure that out."
Chief,"The city council was told that you could handle this job. If you  feel that you can't, perhaps you'd like to take that up... with the  Mayor. (leaves)"
Snyder,I'll handle it. I will.
Willow,"Remember the plan to contact the spirit and talk to it? Scrap  that plan. Buffy, you were right. The time for touchy-feely  communication is passed. I've done some homework and found the only  solution is the final solution."
Xander,Nuke the school? (smiles) I like that.
Willow,Not quite. Exorcism.
Cordelia,Are you crazy? I saw that movie! Even the priest died.
Buffy,What's the deal?
Willow,"Okay, see here, the balcony? That's where the original teacher  died back in 1955 and that teacher last night. That's the hot spot where  all the bad mojo is coming from. We need to create a Mangus-tripod."
Cordelia,A what?
Willow,(points) One person chants here on the hot spot. And the other  three chant in other places around the school forming a triangle. It's  supposed to bind the bad spirit and keep it from doing any more harm.
Buffy,"Well, I'll take the hot spot. (takes the map) If there's  trouble, that's where it'll be."
Xander,"This ghost, this James guy, is fixating on you, Buffy. The  dreams, the yearbook... You sure you can handle it?"
Buffy,"Well, I'm hoping he'll show. I truly am."
Buffy,"Okay, we all have our places. We do the chant and light the  candle at midnight exactly. Any questions?"
Cordelia,"Yeah, what if this mangled triangle thingy doesn't work?"
Willow,Oh! I almost forgot. I made us all scapulas. (hands them out)
Xander,"Okay, so we can flip the ghost over when it turns a nice golden  brown?"
Willow,"Scapula, not spatula. Um, you wear it around your neck for  protection."
Cordelia,You expect me to wear this? It smells like grandpa breath.
Willow,"Sorry, I didn't have a lot of time. I had to use sulfur.  Stinky, but effective."
Buffy,"Okay, let's do this."
Cordelia,No problem. This will be a piece of cake. Right?
Drusilla,Maybe I'll sleep underground. Dig myself a little burrow.
Spike,"What about your pretty dress, sweet? It'll get all dirty."
Drusilla,Then I'll sleep naked. Like the animals do.
Angelus,"You know, I'm suddenly liking this plan."
Spike,"Fortunately, nobody cares what you like, mate."
Angelus,"Oh, yeah? Let's ask Dru."
Drusilla,"There's a gate! (rolls onto her back, laughing) It's opening!  (gets to her knees)"
Angelus,Incoming! I love when she does this.
Spike,"What gate, pet? What do you see?"
Drusilla,(bounces gleefully) It's black. (hums) It wants her. (hums)
Angelus,(crawls up behind her) Wants who?
Drusilla,"The Slayer. It's time, Angel. (stands up) She's ready for you  now. (begins to move) She's dancing. Dancing with death."
Spike,Big deal. He won't do anything. Our man Angel here likes to talk  but he's not much for action. All hat and no cattle.
Angelus,(grabs Dru's waist) I don't know about that. (turns her  around) I think this whole Slayer thing has run its course. (crouches  down by her) I'm ready to focus my energy elsewhere.
Spike,Really?
Angelus,"Oh, yeah! What, with you being Special Needs Boy, I figure I  should stick close to home. (walks his fingers up Dru's thigh and waist)  You and Dru can always use another pair of hands."
Giles,"God, Willow, what are you doing here? You're not supposed to be  inside."
Willow,Me? What about you?
Giles,"I'm, uh, I'm, I'm trying to, uh... (puts on his glasses) I think  I-I may be close to, uh, contacting Jenny."
Giles,What's that smell?
Willow,It's my scapula.
Giles,"Ah, right, of course. Did you use sulfur?"
Willow,Yeah.
Giles,"That's clever. Uh, well, uh, run along then. Th-there may be  some, uh, paranormal ph-phenomena if I contact her. Y-y-you don't want  to be in the line of fire."
Willow,Okay. 'Night.
Lyrics,<I>My love must be a kind of blind love</I>
Lyrics,<I>I can't see anyone but you</I>
Xander,"Oh, yeah, baby, it's snakalicious in here."
Lyrics,<I>The moon may be high / but I can't see a thing in the sky</I>
Lyrics,<I>'Cause I only have eyes for you</I>
Willow,(screams) GILES!
Giles,WILLOW!
Willow,GILES! GILES!
Giles,WHERE ARE YOU?!
Willow,PLEASE! HELP! HELP ME!
Willow,HELP! HELP! HELP! HELP!
James,Stop!
James,Get out!
Giles,Are you all right?
Willow,"(still frightened) Giles, (shakes her head) Jenny could never  be this mean."
Giles,"(glances up at the landing) I know. (sits) It's, it's not her,  is it?"
Willow,I'm sorry.
Willow,"Oh, God. Oh."
Giles,Careful up here!
Willow,I shall confront and expel all evil.
Cordelia,I shall *totally* confront and expel all evil.
Xander,Out of marrow and bone...
Buffy,Out of house and home... never to come here again.
Giles,"Oh, my God!"
Giles,You all right?
Buffy,Get back!
Xander,Check it.
Xander,I'd say school's out for good.
Giles,"The good news is none of you girls were shot. Well, we've  established, based on all the parallels and-and-and Buffy's visions,  that it's James' spirit."
Willow,"So what do we do, Giles? About James."
Giles,"Well, he's obviously reliving the night of the Sadie Hawkins  Dance when he killed Ms. Newman. It-it's-it's common enough for a spirit  to do this, to... recreate a, a tragedy."
Cordelia,"(munches a cracker) Hey. If Sunnydale High School shuts down  forever, do we automatically graduate?"
Xander,"(ignores her) But why? What does he want? (thinks again about  Cordelia's question) Actually, that's an interesting point."
Giles,"He's, he's trying to... resolve whatever issues are keeping him  in limbo. W-w-what exactly those are, I'm not..."
Buffy,(interrupts) He wants forgiveness.
Giles,"(leans back) Yes. (gets up) I imagine he does. (goes to her) But  when James possesses people, they act out exactly what happened that  night. So he's experiencing a form of purgatory instead. I mean, he's,  he's doomed to, to kill his Ms. Newman over and over and over again,  and... forgiveness is impossible."
Buffy,Good. He doesn't deserve it.
Giles,"To forgive is an act of compassion, Buffy. It's, it's not done  because people deserve it. It's done because they need it."
Buffy,"No. James destroyed the one person he loved the most in a moment  of blind passion. And that's not something you forgive. No matter why he  did what he did. And no matter if he knows now that it was wrong and  selfish and stupid, it is just something he's gonna have to live with."
Xander,"He can't live with it, Buff. He's dead."
Cordelia,Okay. Overidentify much? (munches her cracker)
Voice,I need you.
Willow,So what do we do next? Do we go in again?
Giles,"Well, not now. No, the, uh... the spirit is too angry, too, too  powerful. No, we have to work out exactly how and, and if this thing can  be defeated."
Willow,"Hey, Buffy, are you..."
Willow,"Oh, God. Giles! (he comes in) She went back."
Xander,So what now? Not even a mega-vat of Raid's gonna do the trick  here.
Cordelia,I don't get it. Is she trying to be a big loner hero or  something?
Giles,"No. I believe she's under the spirit's thrall. He's, he's  calling her."
Cordelia,But why?
Giles,"James needs her to re-enact everything that happened on the  night that he, he killed Ms. Newman. He wants to change things, make,  make a happy ending."
Willow,"But it can't ever happen! It always ends the same, which means  Buffy just went in there to get shot, Giles."
Giles,"Yes. But the school's deserted. There's no way for James to...  to play his part. There's, there's no man inside for him to possess."
Xander,So Buffy should be safe until we find a way to get her out.
Willow,"In theory, yeah."
Angelus,Fun fact about wasps.
Angelus,"They have no taste for the undead. Not that a sting would do  me any damage, it's just... tonight's special. I wanted to look my best  for you."
Buffy,(quietly) You're the only one. The only person I can talk to.
Angelus,"Gosh, Buff. That's really pathetic."
Buffy,(faces him) You can't make me disappear just because you say  it's over.
Angelus,"Actually... (approaches her) I can. In fact... I just want you  to be able to have some kind of normal life. We can never have that,  don't you see?"
Buffy,I don't give a *damn* about a normal life! I'm going crazy not  seeing you. I think about you every minute.
Buffy,(angrily) Come back here! We're not finished!
Buffy,"You don't care anymore, is that it?"
Angelus,"(sobbing) It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what I feel."
Buffy,Then tell me you don't love me!
James,Say it!
Angelus,I don't. Now let me go. (tries to go)
Buffy,No. A person doesn't just wake up and stop loving somebody!
Buffy,"Love is forever. I'm not afraid to use it, I swear! If I can't  be with you..."
Angelus,"Oh, my God!"
James,DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME...
Buffy,...BITCH!
Buffy,Stop it! (comes out the door) Stop it! Don't make me!
Angelus,(breathing heavily with fear) All right. Just... (turns  around)
James,"Don't. Don't do that, damn it!"
Buffy,Don't talk to me like I'm some stupid...
Angelus,James.
Lyrics,<I>My love must be a kind of blind love</I>
Lyrics,<I>I can't see anyone but you</I>
Buffy,Grace!
Angelus,Don't do this.
Buffy,But-but I killed you.
Angelus,It was an accident. It wasn't your fault.
Buffy,"Oh, it *is* my fault. How could I..."
Angelus,"Shhh. I'm the one who should be sorry, James. You thought I  stopped loving you. But I never did. I loved you with my last breath."
Angelus,Shhh... No more tears.
Buffy,(softly) Angel.
Willow,"Everything seems normal. Not a snake, not a wasp."
Cordelia,Yep. School can open again tomorrow.
Xander,Explain to me again how that's a good thing.
Cordelia,I'm drawing a blank.
Giles,Are you feeling any better?
Buffy,James picked me. I guess... I guess I was the one he could  relate to. He was so sad.
Giles,(sits by her) Well... they can both rest now.
Buffy,I still... (exhales) A part of me just doesn't understand why  she would forgive him.
Giles,Does it matter?
Buffy,No. I guess not.
Spike,"You might want to let up. They say when you've drawn blood,  you've exfoliated."
Angelus,What do you know about it? I'm the one who was friggin'  violated. You didn't have this thing in you.
Drusilla,What was it? A demon?
Angelus,Love!
Drusilla,Poor Angel.
Angelus,(walks back) Let's get outta here. I need a real vile kill  before sunup to wipe this crap out of my system.
Drusilla,Of course. We'll find you a nice toddler. (snarls)
Drusilla,"(to Spike) Want to come, pet?"
