<BLOCKQUOTE>GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire   Slayer</I>...
DAWN,You're never here. You can't even stand to be   around me.
BUFFY,That is not true.
DAWN,You didn't want to come back.   I know that. You want to go away again.
SPIKE,I'm   in.
LOOSE-SKINNED DEMON,Ante up.
BUFFY,You're gonna   play cards?!
HALFREK,"I have been   called, and vengeance shall I wreak."
HALFREK,Hello.
ANYA,Halfrek!
HALFREK,Anyanka?
ANYA,How are you?
XANDER,"You two, you know each   other?"
ANYA,"Funny, Halfrek, I didn't summon you to kill Xander, I called   to invite you to our wedding."
WILLOW,"Tara. What are you doing here? Uh, it's okay for you to be   here if you have things that ... you have to be here for. I'm doing better. No   spells for 32 days."
TARA,"Buffy, I   promise, there's nothing wrong with you."
BUFFY,There has to be. Why do I   feel like this? Why do I let Spike do those things to me?
TARA,Oh!
BUFFY,"Don't tell anyone, please."
TARA,I won't.
BUFFY,(sighs) I'm sorry.
DAWN,It's okay.
BUFFY,"No, we're gonna sit   down and have a real dinner. Someday. I hate having to run out in the middle,   it's just, you know, there's this thing out there. Definitely   non-vampire."
DAWN,(smiling) I understand.
DAWN,"Well, maybe when you get back we can set up for your party   tomorrow."
BUFFY,"Yeah. Uh, this could take a while though, I-I wouldn't   wait up. (putting on her coat) Besides, Willow promised to be on birthday   patrol, so there's nothing left for us to do. (smiling)"
DAWN,Right.
BUFFY,"Okay, so, finish dinner, homework, and don't stay up too   late, all right?"
DAWN,Okay.
BUFFY,Okay.
BUFFY,"Run off, huh? Afraid to face a true warrior?"
BUFFY,"Ooh, shiny."
ANYA,Do you think we should set up lots of candles for Buffy's party   tomorrow?
XANDER,Not if they're that horrible slug kind you keep trying to   unload.
ANYA,(walking past) I don't know why people get so turned off by   slug.
XANDER,"Honey, slugs get turned off by slug. (to Willow) Oh,   actually, I wanted to talk to you about that."
WILLOW,Slugs?
XANDER,"No,   the party. Or, Tara ... at the party."
WILLOW,Oh.
XANDER,"It's just ...   Buffy really wants her there. It seems important to her, so I told her I'd ask   you."
WILLOW,"(smiling) Oh ... yeah, of course, she should totally be there.   It'll be great."
DAWN,(smiling) Hey!
WILLOW,"Hey, Dawnie. Buffy, uh, out patrolling   already? (Dawn nods)"
XANDER,"So, uh, anything new about Warren and the Nerd   Herd?"
DAWN,"No, just a big monster hunt."
XANDER,"Man, a nerd goes into   hiding, he really goes into hiding."
DAWN,Does anybody want to come to the   mall with me for birthday presents?
WILLOW,"Oh, I would, honey, but ...   I've got my group. You know, the whole Spellcasters Anonymous thing? We're   still looking for a better name."
DAWN,"Oh. Well, yeah, uh, no, that-that's   good. You should ... do that. (beat) So what about you guys?"
ANYA,Stuck in   doing-the-books-ville.
XANDER,"Aw, I'd love to go with you, but I gotta   finish this new shift schedule for the crew by tomorrow morning."
WILLOW,"Sorry, it just looks like one of those nights. You know?"
DAWN,Yeah.
WILLOW,You okay going on your own?
DAWN,"Yeah. Somehow I'll, uh,   manage to pull it off."
Cut to,"overhead shot of Sunnydale, night."
Cut to,exterior shot of the   Summers house.
DAWN,Buffy?
Cut to,"high school classroom, next day. Pan across bored students."
TEACHER,"...if we can come up with things Jim lost during his years in   Shanghai, and things he gained. (Shot of Dawn doodling)"
STUDENT,Excuse   me.
TEACHER,Who wants to-
TEACHER,Dawn.
TEACHER,They need you in the guidance office.
Cut to,long shot of Dawn walking down an empty hall lined with lockers.
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR VOICEOVER,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR,"Just a follow-up after your ... your loss. And since   I'm new here, I thought it would give us a chance to know each other."
DAWN,Great.
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR,"So, I've been looking through your file   (shuffling papers on her desk) and, um ... your grades have slipped a   little."
DAWN,I have really hard classes this quarter.
GUIDANCE   COUNSELOR,"Yeah, still. Teachers say that you seem a little distracted   lately."
DAWN,I'm not. I-I'm fine.
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR,"Okay. It's just,   you know, I know it must seem weird, (small laugh) talking to a stranger about   stuff, but, um ... I want you to know that if something's going on,   something's up, my job ... the most important part of my job ... is looking   out for you."
DAWN,I'm really okay.
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR,I know there's been ... a lot of loss.
DAWN,"(quietly) Yeah. Kinda. (looks up) I-I mean, yes. People keep ...   people have a tendency to go away ... and, I miss them. And sometimes ... I   wish I could just make them stop. Going away."
DAWN,"But seriously, it's, it's no big deal. I'm fine."
Cut to,close shot on a table laden with several trays of hors   d'oeuvres.
XANDER,(OS) We're feeding an army!
BUFFY,"(OS) No, they   couldn't make it."
XANDER,"So, who's coming, you invite anyone else?"
BUFFY,"Just you guys.   Willow, Tara. The gang. Oh, and Sophie from work."
BUFFY,What? Like I'm one of those losers who can't make friends outside   her tight little circle? No. I'm friendly. We bonded instantly. Peas in a pod.   Bonded peas.
ANYA,"Really? Um, what's Sophie's last name?"
BUFFY,"(pouting) Okay, shut up."
XANDER,"Don't worry about it, we're all   over the new friend thing. (Anya smiling)"
BUFFY,What ... new friend   thing?
ANYA,"(smiling) Well, well ... we invited someone for you."
ANYA,(whispers) A guy.
DAWN,(entering) For Buffy? Really?   (smiling)
XANDER,"Ahh, don't worry, it's not a setup."
ANYA,"(grinning)   Right. No. Just an attractive single man, with whom we hope you find much in   common. (Buffy looking annoyed) And if you happen to form-"
XANDER,Ahn-
ANYA,-a romantic relationship leading to babies-
XANDER,Ahn-
ANYA,"-and many double dates with us so we have someone else to talk   to, yay!"
BUFFY,I assume this was an act of kindness? (Xander looking embarrassed)   That'll help with the not throttling.
XANDER,"Hey, I'm just gonna get this stuff out there, people should be here   soon."
BUFFY,Hey! You made it!
TARA,"Of course, sweetie. (pulls back) So, how're you doing?"
BUFFY,"Oh,   you know. Better. Mostly. (Tara looking sympathetic) Sometimes."
TARA,"So,   is, um... (looks around) Spike coming?"
BUFFY,"No. He may be a chip-head,   but ... he still doesn't play too well with others."
BUFFY,"Besides, I'm definitely not ready to, to..."
TARA,(turns back)   Come out.
BUFFY,(smiles) Yeah. I'm all ... stay-inny.
BUFFY,How are you doing?
TARA,"(anxious) The word ""gulp"" comes to   mind."
BUFFY,"(sympathetic) Just remember, we're all here...to..."
BUFFY,"...I have to, with the thing that I, uh... Coming!"
WILLOW,Hey.
TARA,Hey.
WILLOW,Hey. (pause) How are you?
TARA,"Fine, thanks, I'm ... I'm fine. I, how are you?"
WILLOW,"(smiling) Great! I   mean... (stops smiling) Fine. I'm, I'm ... finey McFine. Fine."
TARA,Y-you   look...
WILLOW,"(smiles) Thanks. (stops smiling, looks   embarrassed)"
TARA,I mean ... great.
WILLOW,(embarrassed) Thanks. You   do too. Is that a new-
TARA,"Oh, yeah. (glancing nervously at her   dress)"
WILLOW,It's nice.
TARA,Thanks.
TARA,I-I'm gonna get something to drink.
WILLOW,"Oh, yeah, great. You   should."
WILLOW,(muttering to herself) You don't wanna get thirsty.
BUFFY,"Hey, how did it-"
TARA,Yes please.
BUFFY,(surprised) Spike.
SPIKE,Yeah. Willow mentioned the shindig ...   figured we're all part of the team.
SPIKE,"Thought I'd, uh, swing by."
BUFFY,"Wait, what kind of team is this?"
DEMON,Hi. We met once   before.
BUFFY,"Yes, yes we did."
SPIKE,"You know, more, merrier, that   whole thing."
DEMON,"(to Tara) Hi, I'm Clement. Clem."
TARA,Tara.
XANDER,"Buffy, Richard."
BUFFY,(smiling) Hey.
XANDER,He was   wondering where the best place was to park his car.
BUFFY,"Oh, that's easy,   just-(pointing)"
XANDER,Buffy will show ya.
BUFFY,"Okay, uh... (to Tara) I'll be right back."
RICHARD,(whispers) Uh ... the guy with the...
BUFFY,Skin condition. He   doesn't like to talk about it.
SPIKE,Stupid git! (closing the back door)
TARA,"I don't know. He seemed   ... cute. W-was he cute? I mean, I'm not a very good judge, but..."
TARA,(grinning) I think he seemed cute.
CLEM,"(agreeably) I think he   seemed cute, yeah."
DAWN,"If we get Buffy, can, can she start on opening the presents? It's   been enough time, hasn't it?"
ANYA,"Not yet, sweetie."
XANDER,I think   Buffy's busy right now.
ANYA,(as if talking to a small child) Buffy's   making a new friend. A grown-up friend.
DAWN,"What, you mean the guy you   invited to set her up with?"
ANYA,Nothing.
DAWN,"It's not like I don't   understand why you invited him. I was there, remember? I can hear you when I'm   in the room, you know? (Anya just nodding) I do understand these   things."
ANYA,(patronizing) Yes you do! (patting Dawn on the head)
DAWN,"You know I'm in high school, right?"
ANYA,Yes you are!
SPIKE,"You wanna slip away for a minute, luv?"
BUFFY,What?
SPIKE,I'll let you blow out my candles.
BUFFY,Here. Now? I don't think   so.
SPIKE,"Oh, what, you worried about Richard? You don't wanna make your   new boyfriend jealous, huh?"
BUFFY,(grinning) Shut up. He's ...   sweet.
SPIKE,"(teasing) ""Oh, shut up, he's sweet."""
BUFFY,Maybe he's not   the jealous one.
SPIKE,"You think he'll take you out on his ten-speed, pet? (to himself)   Maybe he'll let you ride in that little basket in the front. (scoffs) Jealous   my ass."
BUFFY,Uh...
WILLOW,See? i-it's a battery-operated back massager. And it's portable so   you can take it with you on patrol.
BUFFY,(dubious) Wow.
WILLOW,"(smiling) It's like, instant gratification for all your little acheys."
BUFFY,"(quickly) Great! Thanks! (puts the massager aside) Uh, what's   next?"
DAWN,"(excited) Here, do mine."
BUFFY,(surprised) Dawn.
DAWN,(smiling) Do you like it?
BUFFY,(lifting it out of the box) It's   ... gorgeous.
DAWN,I was so nervous. I was afraid you wouldn't like it.
BUFFY,I-it still has the security tag on it.
DAWN,Huh. That's so weird. I can't believe they didn't take that off.
XANDER,"(OS) Happy birthday, Buffy!"
BUFFY,Oh my god!
BUFFY,Did you guys make that?
ANYA,"Uh, well, uh, Xander did the building. (Dawn still looking upset) I   offered helpful suggestions while observing from a safe distance."
XANDER,"Holds basic weapons, (Buffy smiling) plus a few non-basic ones too.   (loudly) Plus, there's a handsome CD holder."
ANYA,(OS) We wanted you to have something no one else would   have.
BUFFY,(OS) A Xander Harris original.
BUFFY,"I love it. Thanks, you guys!"
TARA,Buffy?
BUFFY,Oh! Sophie!
BUFFY,"Welcome! (Sophie exchanging smiles with Tara) Uh, we're somewhere   between, uh, presents and cake. (to Anya) There is gonna be cake eventually,   right? (Anya nodding)"
SOPHIE,"(walking into the living room) Hey. Uh, my   mom told me to say thank you right away, 'cause, otherwise I usually forget.   So, thank you."
SOPHIE,"And, also, um, I can't have any, any chocolate, or, or peanuts or   egg yolks."
ANYA,(whispers to Buffy) Is this the friend you brought from   work?
BUFFY,Yes.
SOPHIE,A-and sometimes dairy.
BUFFY,No problem.
ANYA,(whispers to Buffy) Our friend is better.
BUFFY,"(OS) Uh, we can do official introductions now that everyone's   officially here. Dawnie, you mind getting the door?"
BUFFY,"(OS) Sophie, this is Anya ... and Willow..."
HALFREK,Wish granted.
RICHARD,Hey.
BUFFY,Hi.
RICHARD,Great party. Everyone's havin'   fun.
BUFFY,(smiling) I hope so.
RICHARD,"I mean, look what time it is   and no one's even thinking about leaving. I, uh ... can't tear myself   away."
BUFFY,(smiling uncertainly) Yeah?
RICHARD,Yeah. Can I get you a   drink?
BUFFY,"Uh ... I'm good, thank you."
RICARD,Okay.
BUFFY,(awkward) I   think I'll just ... head back in.
RICHARD,Well ... I'll look for   you.
BUFFY,(smiling) Okay.
SPIKE,"Ooh, Buffy. (Buffy rolling her eyes) Can I get you a soda pop? I   think I'm in looove."
BUFFY,Stop it. Someone's gonna see.
SPIKE,Mm-hmm.
SPIKE,"I had ... a ... muscle cramp. Buffy was, uh, helping."
TARA,"(small grin) A muscle cramp? In your ... (looks down at him, then away)   pants?"
SPIKE,"What, it's a thing."
TARA,(grinning) Right.
ANYA VOICEOVER,"No, you go."
XANDER,"(teasing, nuzzling) No, you go."
ANYA,"(teasing, nuzzling) No,   you go."
WILLOW,Okay!
WILLOW,"It's just a beer run, I'll go."
SOPHIE,"Oh, well, I can't really   drink beer, 'cause you know, barley. But I'll go with you to get   some."
WILLOW,Perfect. Here we go. The beer-gettin'.
BUFFY,This sucks. I'm out. (giving money to Anya)
RICHARD,No way. I   think you're doing fine.
XANDER,(to Buffy) You wanna try poker?
CLEM,Still say it's weird   without the kittens.
BUFFY,No kittens. (Richard giving her a funny look)   He's quirky.
RICHARD,"Look, we've already been playing for like three   hours, it's, you know, it's like two-something in the morning. You can't bail   now."
ANYA,"Yeah, come on, Buffy, stay. I wanna bankrupt somebody. (Buffy   giving her a sour look)"
DAWN,Oh! We should totally have a slumber   party.
BUFFY,"(uncertain) Oh, I don't know... (looking around) I guess, as   long as everyone's staying up anyway."
SPIKE,Must be some late-night   activities to keep us busy till morning. (giving Buffy a suggestive look)   (Buffy glaring at him)
TARA,"How's that cramp, Spike? Still bothering   you?"
SPIKE,What? Oh. Yeah.
TARA,"Maybe you, uh, wanna put some ice on   it."
RICHARD,"Hey Xander, we gotta be at work in a few minutes."
XANDER,(staring at TV) Okay.
RICHARD,I can't be late today.
SPIKE,You should definitely go. Let's   find your coat and get you on your merry way.
BUFFY,Spike.
RICHARD,(confused) I don't know why I'm not leaving.
SPIKE,"Me either. Besides,   Richie, you can't skip breakfast. Growing boy like you. (Buffy glaring at him)   Me, I used to love breakfast. In the old days, I probably would have eaten by   now. (looks menacingly at Richard)"
BUFFY,"Of course, with that new diet of   yours, you wanna be careful what you try puttin' in your mouth now, Spikey.   (giving him a meaningful look)"
SPIKE,"Yeah? I don't know. Tummy's making   all kinds of gurglies. Maybe I oughta just feed on whatever's around... (Buffy   looking at Richard. Richard looking bemused) even if it doesn't go down well.   (to Richard) You, uh, work out?"
BUFFY,Okey-dokey.
BUFFY,(to Richard) 'Scuse us.
BUFFY,"Hey, Mister Passive-Aggressive Guy. Seriously, you wanna take it   down a notch or two in there?"
SPIKE,"What, poor dainty Richard can't take a   joke?"
BUFFY,(firmly) We do not joke about eating people in this   house!
SPIKE,"(angrily) What are you gonna do, beat me up again?"
BUFFY,I should have thrown you out the second you got here. (Spike rolling his eyes)   I was insane to ever think you could just hang out with my friends.
SPIKE,"And *I* was insane to think... (pauses) No, wait. You were right. *You're*   insane."
WILLOW,"(OS) Oh, hi."
TARA,(looks up) Hey.
TARA,Breakfast. Didn't really plan for a sleep-over.
WILLOW,"I know, me   either. It's weird, I ... I have class, and I know I should go,   but...(sits)"
TARA,"I know, i-it's like, I wanna leave, but I don't want   to."
WILLOW,(smiles) Exactly.
BUFFY,(angrily) I think it's time for you to go.
SPIKE,"Yeah, well,   can't. (gesturing) Daylight."
BUFFY,Okay. I'll go.
SPIKE,I'll get the   door.
BUFFY,Fine!
SPIKE,Fine!
BUFFY,I'm actually trying to move   right now.
SPIKE,(quieter) Me too.
BUFFY,Well ... this can't be good.
BUFFY,There's something keeping us in this house.
XANDER,Or   someone.
TARA,Has everyone tried to get out?
WILLOW,"What if we just,   like, as a group, got up and, and threw ourselves at the door?"
XANDER,All   right. Count of three. (everyone preparing) One ... two ... three!
XANDER,Here we go!
BUFFY,Hence the problem.
RICHARD,"I really need to go. I mean, I have a   job to get to."
ANYA,I have to open the Magic Box.
SOPHIE,"I have a   shift at the DoubleMeat. (thinks) Actually, I'm okay here."
CLEM,"Yeah, I'm,   I'm fine."
XANDER,"Willow and Tara have class, I gotta be at the   site."
BUFFY,"I know, I know, we all have places that we'd rather be."
SPIKE,(softly) Things we'd rather be doing.
BUFFY,I think the first   priority has to be to find a way out.
DAWN,"Sure. Of course you all wanna   leave. (Buffy looking at her) 'Cause being stuck in here with me, that would   really suck, right?"
WILLOW,"No, Dawnie! It's just, we have more important things to   do."
DAWN,"(disgusted) Yeah, I know. Important. (gets up) Whatever that   means, right?"
BUFFY,Dawn?
DAWN,What?
BUFFY,Did you do something?
DAWN,(exasperated) Me?
TARA,Do you know something? 'Cause we want you to feel   like you can tell us.
DAWN,(angrily) What would I know?
WILLOW,"Look, we're not accusing you   of anything, it's just ... you were kind of taking it personal down   there."
DAWN,Oh. Okay. So you've all just decided that somehow I'm   responsible. (sourly) Great. Here's me baskin' in the love.
XANDER,"No,   it's just, you know, you're upset 'cause we all wanna leave. And now we can't   leave. Only thing missing is a cornfield. There ... there isn't a cornfield,   is there?"
BUFFY,"Dawnie, it's okay. You know, we're not gonna be   mad."
DAWN,"Yeah, only I didn't do anything!"
WILLOW,You sure?
DAWN,You want me to ask my other self?
BUFFY,"Dawn, we're just trying to figure   out what's going on."
DAWN,(angrily) Figure it out yourself. I'm done being   talked to like a kid.
XANDER,"Well, 'cause you know, sometimes we do   something that seems like a good idea at the time, like, say, invoke the power   of a musical amulet? And it turns out, you know, not so much."
DAWN,God! I   didn't do anything! I wish I had. (Buffy frowning) I'm glad you're trapped.   (very angrily) How else can I get anybody to spend any time with me?
BUFFY,Dawn. If you want us to spend time with you-
DAWN,I don't. Get out.
DAWN,"(shrieking) Get out, get out, get out!"
ANYA VOICEOVER,I think she's possessed.
XANDER,She's a teenager.
TARA,"Phones are all out, we're totally cut off."
BUFFY,(quietly) She's just so angry.
TARA,It happens. We all went   through it.
BUFFY,I know. I just can't figure out why she didn't come to   me.
XANDER,"Well, you have been a little busy lately."
SPIKE,"Hey, I don't wanna keep you all from the touchy-feelies, but maybe   the encounter group can meet later. Say, when we're not trapped in a   house."
TARA,"Even if Dawn does know something, she's obviously not gonna   help us right now. We need another way."
BUFFY,"I think magic's gonna be our   best bet. (Willow looking alarmed) Something general, you know? Cast a wide   net. (Tara nodding)"
XANDER,But ... Willow. (gesturing toward Willow with   his head)
TARA,"No, I'll do it. (Willow fidgeting nervously) It's just,   o-obviously I didn't bring any supplies."
BUFFY,"(OS) Well, we don't have any in the house.   We got rid of everything."
WILLOW,"Actually ... not everything. (guilty) I,   uh... might have ... kept one or, or two things. Sort of."
WILLOW,...just in case.
XANDER,That's great!
XANDER,...in a very bad way. (shaking finger at Willow)
TARA,(to Willow) Just ... bring me what you have. (firmly) But I'm doing   this alone. You need to stay away from it.
Cut to,"exterior shot of the house, day."
ANYA,So we're supposed to just wait?
WILLOW,It won't take long.
RICHARD,"All right, somebody wanna tell me what's, what's going on here?   We're trapped in a house by ... by what, some unseen force or something.   (gesturing at the door) Who knows what she's doing in there. (pointing to the   kitchen) And I have to tell you... (looks back at Clem scratching his head   with clawed fingers) I don't think that's a skin condition."
TARA,Release.
TARA,(calls) Try the door!
SPIKE,(annoyed) No. Can't.
SPIKE,What the bloody hell was that?
BUFFY,That's the demon I killed   two nights ago.
SPIKE,The demon you thought you killed.
XANDER,It   looks pretty bad.
ANYA,"Oh god. Oh, god."
TARA,Let's get him upstairs. (to Buffy) We need to get him to a doctor   soon.
BUFFY,"(addressing everyone) Hey, i-it's gonna be okay."
BUFFY,"Just trust me, I promise we'll be out of here soon."
Cut to,"exterior shot of the house, night."
SOPHIE,Oh god. Oh god.
BUFFY,"Okay, so maybe 'soon' was a bit of an overstatement."
SPIKE,"So,   you ever think about *not* celebrating a birthday? Just to try it, I   mean."
BUFFY,I'm gonna go check upstairs. Keep an eye on things down here?
BUFFY,"You stay here, okay?"
DAWN,"What's that noise? It's in the walls, isn't it?"
CLEM,(nervously) Sorry.
ANYA,Why is it so hot in here?
XANDER,"You're just a little freaked   out, that's all. It'll pass."
ANYA,"He's gonna die. He's gonna die, and   we're gonna watch."
XANDER,Ahn...
ANYA,And we're just sitting here. Why   are we just sitting here? Why aren't we doing something?
XANDER,We are. We   will. We've been through worse.
ANYA,"(panting, rubbing her chest) Not like   this. Not trapped like animals. Seriously, did someone turn on the heat?   (unbuttoning her blouse) I can't breathe, I just ... oh, I just can't breathe   ... I can't breathe..."
XANDER,"(grabbing her hands) Ahn, stop. Stop, Ahn,   stop!"
XANDER,"Listen to me. You're just freaking out, okay? It's normal. You're   just ... you're just scared. We all are. We'll come up with a plan ... and   we'll get through it, all right? (Anya nodding, creaking noises continue)   We'll do something."
ANYA,What?
XANDER,"I don't know. (brushing hair out   of her face) Lemme get you some water, okay? (Anya nodding) It'll cool you   down. I'll be back in a second, okay? Stay here, don't move."
ANYA,Xander?
BUFFY,Grab the sword!
BUFFY,Are you hurt?
BUFFY,"Here, let me see."
ANYA,(OS) Xander.
XANDER,"It's okay. I'm okay, see? Shh."
XANDER,(whispers) It's all right. I'm okay.
BUFFY,It's getting kinda scary. You okay?
DAWN,"(sullen, not looking at   Buffy) Do you care?"
BUFFY,(exasperated) Fine. Stay with Spike.
DAWN,It's not like I meant for this to happen.
BUFFY,I never said that   you did.
DAWN,I didn't want this.
BUFFY,What did you want?
DAWN,(softly) Nothing.
BUFFY,"Dawn, come   on."
DAWN,No. You don't know! You have this thing you do. You have all   these friends. (softly) You have no idea what it's like.
BUFFY,"What are   you talking about? I don't know what, what-"
DAWN,Being alone!
BUFFY,You're not alone!
DAWN,Then why do I feel like this?
TARA,"I just think we haven't thought of the right way out yet, that's all."
SPIKE,"Well, we can't just stay put like cattle, waiting for that thing to   pop out every time it gets peckish."
TARA,"I'd say we do another spell, but   I, I think we've tried everything."
ANYA,"Well ... that's not completely   true, is it? (Tara frowning) I mean, not everything. (looks at Willow) Not   exactly. (Willow looking nervous) We're sitting here with an incredibly   powerful witch ... much more powerful than you, Tara, I'm sorry ... only no   one seems willing to say it."
WILLOW,I can't.
ANYA,"No, see, that's not   exactly true either. (angrily) Not can't, won't."
WILLOW,You don't know how   much I hate this. I don't know if there's even ... anything I could   do.
ANYA,"Yes ... and a good way to find out is to sit around and try   nothing. That was sarcasm, by the way."
SPIKE,Look-
WILLOW,It's   dangerous.
ANYA,And so is all of us dying!
XANDER,"Will ... look, I   don't wanna gang up on you ... but Anya kinda has a point. (Willow looking   anxious) We brought you back from it once. We're all here, it's just one   little spell, (Spike shaking his head) whatever happens, we can bring you back   again."
WILLOW,"(firmly) No. I can't. (to Anya) If I start, I ... I might   not be able to stop."
ANYA,"And whose fault is that? (stands up, walks   toward Willow) You know, if you hadn't gotten so much of this in your system   in the first place-"
TARA,Hey! You're gonna back off!
TARA,"She said no, and that's it. You're not gonna make her do something   that she doesn't want to. And if you try... (folds arms across her chest)   You're gonna have to go through me first. Understood?"
ANYA,"Fine. If you all aren't willing to get us out of this, then I will do   it myself."
BUFFY,I wish you would have told me.
DAWN,You haven't really   been...
BUFFY,What? I haven't been what?
DAWN,Around.
BUFFY,Dawn   ... the most important job that I have ... is looking out for you.
DAWN,(small smile) You sound like my guidance counselor. She give you a handbook or   something? 'Talkin' to the Troubled Teen'?
BUFFY,(frowning)   Counselor?
DAWN,It wasn't my idea. I didn't even know we had guidance   counselors. She called me out of class like I was a total J.D.
BUFFY,And   you'd ... never met her before?
DAWN,"No, not until yesterday."
BUFFY,And ... she got you to start talking about things that bothered you at   home?
DAWN,(uncertain) Uh ... yeah?
BUFFY,"You didn't, by any chance,   happen to ... express like a, a wish, or-or something, to her?"
DAWN,(nervous) Um ... maybe just a little.
XANDER,"Honey, come on, this isn't the way, calm down."
ANYA,"(still   searching) She knows something. She knows something, we have to find out what   it is."
DAWN,Hey!
XANDER,"Ahn, just stop for a second."
ANYA,There's gotta   be a clue in here somewhere.
DAWN,Stop it!
BUFFY,"Anya, it wasn't her fault."
DAWN,No!
ANYA,Half this stuff is from the Magic Box.
ANYA,How could you do this?
ANYA,"I work hard at that store, and I helped you! (grabs Dawn's arm, turns   her around) I took care of you. This is how you say 'thank you'?"
BUFFY,"Anya, hold on, okay? (to Dawn) Tell her you didn't do this. Tell her   it's a mistake."
DAWN,(anguished) No!
BUFFY,Oh. (looking at Dawn)
DAWN,(upset) Buffy...
ANYA,"How are we   supposed to trust you, Dawn? I mean, you ... you say you didn't put us here,   but look at this stuff! How are we supposed to believe you?"
BUFFY,"Look, I-I don't think she- I don't think it's all her fault, okay?   She ... there was a guidance counselor, or someone pretending to be a guidance   counselor, she, she made Dawn make a wish."
ANYA,Guidance counselor? You   made a wish to someone you've never seen before?
DAWN,(nervous)   Yeah?
ANYA,"Did she wear a pendant with a, with a dark blue stone?"
DAWN,And little red flecks?
ANYA,"Uhh, for crying out loud. (yells) Halfrek! (to   Dawn) It's Halfrek, a vengeance demon. You made a wish to a vengeance   demon."
DAWN,I didn't know.
ANYA,"Only a vengeance demon can break her   own vengeance spell. Nothing else will work. She's the only one who can get us   out of here. (yells) Hallie, get your ass down here!"
HALFREK,(deep resonant voice) You rang?
ANYA,"(punching) I hope you die, you stupid jerkface!"
XANDER,Anya!
SPIKE,The sword!
ANYA,Her pendant! Get her pendant!
HALFREK,(normal voice) There will be no touching of the pendant.
HALFREK,What? (laughs) Did you think I'd be stopped by a sword in the   chest?
HALFREK,"Flesh wound. (Anya getting up) Honestly, Anyanka, you used to know   better."
ANYA,(coming closer) How could you? Why would you do   this?
HALFREK,I told you I was going to take care of some business while I   was here in town.
ANYA,"Yeah, but cursing us? Some of them are in the   wedding party."
HALFREK,I just go where I'm-
HALFREK,(shocked whisper) William?
SPIKE,"(frowning) Hey, wait a   minute."
BUFFY,You guys know each other?
HALFREK,"(quickly) Uh, no. (laughs) No."
SPIKE,(still frowning) Not really.
TARA,I thought vengeance demons only punished men who wronged   women.
HALFREK,"Oh, that was Anya's little <I>raison d'être</I>. Most of us   try to be a little more well-rounded. And actually, we prefer 'justice demon.'   Okay? FYI."
ANYA,"Well-rounded, huh? Is that how you explain your thing for   bad parents?"
HALFREK,"Oh, it's not a thing. The children need me."
ANYA,Hmm! (coughing)Daddy issues(coughing)
HALFREK,"Sling all the little barbs   at me that you want, Anyanka, it doesn't change the fact that this girl was in   pain, (pointing at Dawn) and none of you could hear it. (Dawn looks down) I   could hear her crying out everywhere I went in this town. (Anya looking   guilty) It was unbearable. And none of you knew."
HALFREK,You people deserve to be cursed. (shot of the others listening)   Enjoy your time together. From now on ... all you have is time. (to Anya) Time   ... and each other. Good luck!
HALFREK,Wait ... (nervous laugh) Wait.
HALFREK,"(muttering to herself) Time, and each other."
ANYA,"(rolling her eyes) It's the curse, Hallie."
HALFREK,"Oh, for crying   out loud. Fine, the curse is lifted! We can all leave now! ... Damn it."
WILLOW,"Thanks ... for before. And, and for taking this stuff with   you."
TARA,(nodding) No problem.
WILLOW,"Just so you know, I-I was never   ... gonna use it. I mean, not really, I ... I just kept it like a safety net.   'Cause ... there was always this ... thing in the back of my head. This, you   know, voice, saying, like, 'what if things get bad, I mean really bad? And   what if you can't handle it?' A-and it made me panic, so ... that's why I kept   a couple of things. I ... kept them so I-I didn't have to think about it, so I   could focus on ... on getting better."
TARA,"I get it. I-I really do. But   it's time to work without the net, Will. (Willow looking anxious) You know, I   don't know if you noticed, but it actually did get bad in there. Really bad,   and ... and you still said no."
RICHARD,You have some weird friends.
XANDER,News from the file marked   'duh.' (to Buffy) We're gonna get him to the E.R. (Buffy nodding)
ANYA,"And   then we're gonna talk about payment. And Dawnie, there are two words I want   you to get used to..."
ANYA,(OS) Punitive damages.
BUFFY,(to   Spike) Think it's worn off?
SPIKE,Just one thing to do.
ANYA,"Okay, who's pushing?"
TARA,"Wow, look at the stars!"
CLEM,(turning back to give Buffy a   thumbs-up) Good party!
XANDER,"(OS) I just wanna run barefoot on the grass so I can feel the   dew-drops between my... God, look at the stars!"
