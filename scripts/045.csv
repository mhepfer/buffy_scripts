character,dialogue
Joyce,Is it a vampire?
Buffy,"Mom, what are you doing here?"
Joyce,"(holds up the bag and thermos) I brought you a snack. I thought  it was about time for me to come out and watch. Y-you know, the slaying."
Buffy,"You know, the slaying is kind of an alone thing."
Joyce,"But it's such a big part of your life, and I'd like to  understand it. It's, um, you know, something we could share."
Buffy,"A-actually, it's pretty dull, you know, it's (distracted) bam  boom stick... poof."
Joyce,"Good, honey! Kill him!"
Joyce,"(points) Buffy, he-he's over here!"
Joyce,"Oh, my God! It's Mr. Sanderson from the bank!"
Joyce,(points with the thermos) And he's getting away!
Buffy,Stay!
Joyce,"Oh, God. (takes a breath) Oh..."
Buffy,(reaches her mother) They said we can go home now.
Joyce,(distraught) They were little kids. Did you see them? They're so  tiny.
Buffy,(sympathetically) I saw.
Joyce,(shaking her head) Who could do something like this? I just...  (looks down sadly)
Buffy,"I'm so sorry that you had to see this. But I promise, everything  is gonna be okay."
Joyce,How?
Buffy,Because I'm gonna *find* whatever did it.
Joyce,I guess. It's just you can't... you can't make it right.
Buffy,(comfortingly) I know. I'm sorry. But I'll take care of  everything. I promise. Just try and calm down.
Buffy,(upset) Don't tell me to calm down!
Giles,(taken aback) I-I-I only meant...
Buffy,"They were kids, Giles. Little kids! You don't know what it was  like to see them there. My mom can't even talk."
Giles,(takes a few steps down) I'm sorry. I... I just want to help.
Buffy,(calms a bit) I know.
Giles,Do we know how? Uh... It wasn't a vampire? (sits on the table)
Buffy,No. There were no marks.
Buffy,"Wait. I-I mean, there, there was a mark, um, a-a symbol."
Giles,"Oh, uh, 12th century, Papal Encyclical. Write on this."
Buffy,"I-it was on their hands. The cops are keeping it quiet, but I  got a good look at it."
Buffy,There. Find me the thing that uses this symbol and point me at  it.
Giles,(thoughtfully) Hmm.
Buffy,"Hmm. What? Giles, speak."
Giles,"(torn from his reverie) What? Oh, sorry. Um, no, it... (picks up  the notebook) I just wonder if we're looking for a thing. The use of a  symbol o-o-on a victim like this suggests a, a ritual murder and a cult  sacrifice by a group."
Buffy,A group of... human beings? Someone with a soul did this?
Giles,"Yes, I'm afraid so."
Buffy,"Okay. Then while you're looking for the meaning of that symbol  thingy, could you also find a loophole in that 'Slayers don't kill  people' rule?"
Giles,"Buffy, this is a dreadful crime, I know, (stands up) and you  have every right to be upset, but... I-I wonder if you're not letting  yourself get a shade, uh... more personal because of your mother's  involvement."
Buffy,"(stands and faces him) Oh, it's *completely* personal. Giles,  find me the people that did this. Please."
Xander,Hey.
Oz,Hey.
Xander,"(slightly nervous) So, a burrito."
Oz,This is a burrito.
Xander,Damn straight.
Willow,"Hi, Oz."
Oz,Hey.
Willow,Xander. Hi.
Oz,"Hey, Amy."
Amy,"Hi, guys."
Xander,"Hey, Amy. I like your new hair."
Oz,(to Willow) I haven't see you all day. Where you been?
Xander,"(shaking his head defensively) Not with me. No, sir. Ask  anyone. No."
Oz,"So, Buffy's birthday is next week."
Xander,(claps his hands and points at Oz) Ooh! Yeah. Good. I've been  pondering gift options.
Willow,Shh.
Xander,"Oh, come on, we just got a topic here."
Willow,"Hi, Buffy."
Xander,Buffy! (stands up) What's up?
Buffy,You guys didn't hear?
Xander,Hear what?
Buffy,A murder. Somebody killed two little kids.
Willow,"(shocked) Oh, no."
Buffy,"They were, like, seven or eight years old. My mom found the  bodies during patrol last night."
Amy,"Oh, my God."
Oz,Kids?
Xander,Why was your mom there?
Buffy,"More bad. She picked last night, of all nights, for a surprise  bonding visit."
Willow,"God, your mom would actually take the time to do that with you?"
Willow,"That really wasn't the point of the story, was it?"
Buffy,"No. The point is, she's completely wigging."
Joyce,Who's wigging?
Buffy,"(thinking quickly) Um... everyone. You know, 'cause of what  happened."
Joyce,"Oh, it's so awful. I-I had bad dreams about it all night."
Willow,"Hi, Mrs. Summers."
Joyce,"(absently) Oh, hi, everybody."
Xander,Hi.
Amy,"Hi, Mrs. Summers."
Joyce,"Buffy, have you talked to Mr. Giles yet about who could have  done this?"
Buffy,"Yeah. He, uh... He thinks it might be something ritual. A cult.  Uh, he's still looking. In the meantime, we're gonna add to my patrol  and, and, y'know, keep an eye out."
Joyce,A cult. (jumps to a conclusion) Like witches.
Willow,Sorry. Phlegm. Too much dairy.
Joyce,"Oh, I-I-I know you kids think that stuff's cool. Buffy told me  you dabble."
Willow,(nervously) Right. Absolutely. That's me. I'm a dabbler.
Joyce,But anybody who could do this isn't cool. Anybody who could do  this has to be a monster. It's...
Buffy,"(interrupts) You know what? Uh, would you guys excuse us for a  little bit?"
Joyce,"Uh, n-nice to see you."
Xander,"What a burn. I mean, Buff's mom was just starting to accept the  whole Slayer thing, and now she's gonna be double-freaked."
Willow,(smiles) Makes me grateful that my mom's not interested in my  extra-curricular activities.
Willow,Or my *curricular* activities.
Joyce,"Are your friends gonna help with the investigation, too?"
Buffy,"Mom, I really think... Maybe this isn't the best place to talk  about this."
Joyce,Are you embarrassed to be hanging out with your mother? I didn't  hug you.
Buffy,"No. It's just... This hall is about school, and you're about  home. Mix them, my world dissolves."
Joyce,"It's just, I keep thinking about who could have done such a  thing. I have to help."
Buffy,"Well, Giles can always use help in the library."
Joyce,I called everybody I know in town. I told them about the dead  children. They're all just as upset as I am.
Buffy,(confused) You called everybody that you know?
Joyce,"And they called all their friends. And guess what? We're setting  up a vigil, for tonight, for City Hall. The Mayor is even gonna be  there. Now we are gonna get some action. (smiles)"
Buffy,"(less than thrilled) Uh-huh. That's great. Uh... But you know  what? A lot of times when we're working on stuff like this, we like to  keep the number of people that know about it kind of... small."
Joyce,"(considers) Oh. Right. Well, I-I'm sure there won't be all that  many people."
Buffy,This is great. Maybe we could all go patrolling together later.
Willow,(gestures at Joyce) At least your mom's making an effort. My  mom's probably... (notices) standing right in front of me right this  second.
Willow,Mom?
Sheila,"Willow, I-I didn't know you were going to be here. (to Buffy,  absently) Oh, hi, Bunny."
Buffy,Hi.
Willow,"Mom, what are you doing here?"
Sheila,"Oh, well, I read about it in the paper, and what with your dad  out of town... (notices, surprised) Willow, you cut off your hair! Huh.  That's a new look."
Willow,"Yeah, it's just a sudden whim I had... in August."
Sheila,(smiles) I like it.
Sheila,"Hello, Joyce."
Joyce,"Sheila, I'm glad you could come."
Giles,"There you are. I almost didn't find you in this crush. (notices  Joyce) (nervously) Oh, uh, Mrs., uh... uh, Joyce. Quite a turnout you  have here."
Joyce,"Oh, well, it's, it's not just me, but thank you. Well, it's, uh,  it's been a while."
Giles,"(uneasy) Right. Not since, um... Not since... Not for a while."
Sheila,"There's a rumor going around, Mr. Giles."
Giles,"(suddenly worried) R-rumor, about us?"
Giles,A-a-about what?
Sheila,About witches. (Willow and Buffy exchange a look) People  calling themselves witches are responsible for this brutal crime.
Giles,Indeed? How strange.
Willow,"(laughs nervously, trying to play it off) Yes! Strange!  Witches."
Sheila,"(goes into lecture mode) Well, actually, not that strange. I  recently co-authored a paper about the rise of mysticism among  adolescents, and I was shocked at the statistical..."
Sheila,"Oh. Oh, a-are we starting?"
Joyce,"(to Buffy, wispering) He'll do something about this. You'll see."
Joyce,Thank you.
Joyce,"Mr. Mayor, you're dead wrong. (people begin to murmur) This is  *not* a good town. How many of us have, have lost someone who, who just  disappeared? Or, or got skinned? Or suffered neck rupture? And how many  of us have been too afraid to speak out? I-I was supposed to lead us in  a moment of silence, but... silence is this town's disease. For too long  we-we've been plagued by unnatural evils. This isn't our town anymore.  It belongs to the monsters and, and the witches and the Slayers."
Joyce,I say it's time for the grownups to take Sunnydale back. I say  we start by finding the people who did this and making them pay.
Man,"Hear, hear!"
Michael,Watch it.
Roy,"(smiling smugly) Oh, sorry. Did I make you smudge your eyeliner?"
Roy,You gonna put a spell on me?
Amy,"Hey, what is your problem?"
Roy,Everyone knows he's into that voodoo witchcraft. (other students  stare) I heard about those kids. People like him... (slams Michael  again) gotta learn a lesson.
Amy,And what about people like me?
Roy,(threateningly) Get in my face and you'll find out.
Roy,No problem here. (nods to the other boys) We're walking.
Buffy,You guys okay?
Michael,Yeah. We're fine. (walks off)
Amy,"(smiles) Thanks, Buffy. (walks off)"
Cordelia,"You'll be one busy little Slayer, baby-sitting them."
Buffy,I doubt they'll have any more trouble.
Cordelia,"I doubt your doubt. Everyone knows that witches killed those  kids, and Amy is a witch. And Michael is whatever the boy of witch is,  plus being the poster child for yuck."
Buffy,Corde...
Cordelia,"(interrupts) If you're gonna hang with them, expect badness.  'Cause that's what you get when you hang with freaks and losers. Believe  me, I know."
Cordelia,(smiling) That was a pointed comment about me hanging with  you guys. (turns and leaves)
Buffy,"Yeah, I got that one. (loudly after her) Besides, witches didn't  do it. (turns to Giles)"
Giles,"(whispers) Actually, I think they may have. My research keeps  bringing me back to European Wiccan covens."
Buffy,You found the meaning of the symbol?
Giles,"(exhales) I'm pretty sure, yes. There's a, a piece of  information I need that's in a book that Willow borrowed. Can you find  it?"
Xander,"Buffy, hi."
Buffy,Hey. Is Willow around?
Xander,"(exasperated) How can I convince you people that it's over? You  assume because I'm here, she's here, that I somehow mysteriously know  where she is."
Buffy,(points) Those her books?
Xander,Yeah. She's in the bathroom. (points)
Xander,"But the fact that I know that doesn't change that I have a  genuine complaint here. Look. I'm getting sick of the judgment, the  innuendoes. Is a man not innocent until proven guilty?"
Buffy,"You *are* guilty. You got illicit smoochies, gonna have to pay  the price."
Xander,"But I'm talking about the future guilt. Look, everyone expects  me to mess up again. Like Oz. I see how he is around me. You know, that  steely gaze... that pointed silence."
Buffy,'Cause he's usually such a chatterbox.
Xander,"No, but it's different now. It's more a verbal nonverbal. He  speaks volumes with his eyes."
Willow,"Hey, Buff. What cha looking for? You wanna borrow something?"
Buffy,(holds up the notebook) What is this?
Willow,"(takes and closes it) A doodle. I do doodle. You, too. You do  doodle, too."
Buffy,This is a witch symbol.
Willow,"Okay, yeah, it is."
Buffy,Willow...
Willow,(defensively) What?
Buffy,That symbol was on the murdered children.
Snyder,(smugly) This is a glorious day for principals everywhere. No  pathetic whining about students' rights. Just a long row of lockers and  a man with a key.
Oz,"(to Willow, quietly) They just took three kids away."
Buffy,What are they looking for?
Amy,Witch stuff.
Willow,(very worried) What?
Amy,They got my spells. I'm supposed to report to Snyder's office.
Willow,"Oh, my God."
Willow,"(to Buffy, sick with worry) I have stuff in my locker. Henbane,  hellebore, mandrake root."
Xander,(interrupts) Excuse me. Playboys. Can we turn the sympathy  (jerks his head) this way?
Cordelia,Hey! Get your grubby custodial hands off that. (tries to  approach)
Cordelia,"That hair spray costs $45, and it's imported!"
Willow,"(begins to freak out) Oh, God, my locker's next. Buffy, I  didn't do anything wrong."
Willow,"The, the symbol is harmless. I used it to make a protection  spell for you, for your birthday. With Michael and Amy. Only, now it's  broken, because you know about it, so happy birthday, and please, you  have to believe me!"
Snyder,Ms. Rosenberg. My office.
Buffy,Giles.
Giles,They're confiscating my books.
Buffy,"Giles, we need those books."
Giles,"Believe me, I tried to tell that to the nice man with the big  gun."
Buffy,No. There's something about the symbol that we're missing.  Willow said she used it in a protection spell. It's harmless. Not a big  bad. So then why would it turn up in a ritual sacrifice?
Giles,"I don't know. Ordinarily, I would say let's widen our research."
Buffy,Using what? A-a dictionary and 'My Friend Flicka'?
Giles,"This is intolerable. Snyder's interfered before, but I, I won't  take this from that twisted little homunculus."
Snyder,(smirking) I love the smell of desperate librarian in the  morning.
Giles,(approaches him angrily) You get out! And take your marauders  with you.
Snyder,"(unaffected) Oh, my. So fierce. (walks past him) I suppose I  should hear you out. Just how is, um... (takes a book from an officer,  reads the title) 'Blood Rites and Sacrifices' appropriate material for a  public school library? Chess club branching out? (sips his coffee)"
Giles,This is not over.
Snyder,"Oh, I should say it's just beginning. Fight it if you want.  Just remember, lift a finger against me, and you'll have to answer to  MOO."
Buffy,(incredulous) Answer to MOO? Did that sentence just make some  sense that I'm not in on?
Snyder,'Mothers Opposed to the Occult.' A powerful new group. (sips  his coffee)
Buffy,And who came up with that lame name?
Snyder,(heads out) That would be the founder. I believe you call her  'Mom'.
Sheila,"Oh, sit down, honey."
Willow,(goes to the couch) Principal Snyder talk to you? (takes off  her pack and sits)
Sheila,Yes. He's quite concerned. (looks at an old picture)
Willow,"Mom, I know what this looks like, and I can totally..."
Sheila,"(interrupts) Oh, you don't have to explain, honey. This isn't  exactly a surprise. (turns over the picture)"
Willow,"(fidgets, confused) Why not?"
Sheila,"(shrugs) Oh, well, identification with mythical icons is  perfectly typical of your age group. It's a, a classic adolescent  response to the pressures of incipient adulthood. (set the picture down)"
Willow,Oh. Is that what it is?
Sheila,"(picks up a bag of herbs) Of course, I wish you could've  identified with something a little less icky, (shrugs) but  developmentally speaking..."
Willow,"Mom, I'm not an age group. I'm me. Willow group."
Sheila,"Oh, honey..."
Sheila,I understand. (sits next to her)
Willow,"No, you don't. (faces her) Mom, this may be hard for you to  accept, but I can do stuff. Nothing bad or dangerous, but I can do  spells."
Sheila,"You think you can, and that's what concerns me. The delusions."
Willow,"Mom, how would you know what I can do? I mean, the last time we  had a conversation over three minutes, it was about the patriarchal bias  of the Mr. Rogers Show."
Sheila,"Well, (makes finger quotes) with King Friday lording it over  all the lesser puppets..."
Willow,"Mom, you're not paying attention."
Sheila,"And this is your way of trying to get it. Now, I have consulted  with some of my colleagues, and they agree that this is a cry for  discipline. You're grounded."
Willow,"(surprised) Grounded? This is the first time *ever* I've done  something you don't like and I'm grounded? I'm supposed to mess up. I'm  a teenager, remember?"
Sheila,"You're upset, I hear you..."
Willow,"(stands up) No, Ma, hear this! I'm a rebel! I'm having a  rebellion!"
Sheila,"(smiling) Willow, honey, you don't need to act out like this to  prove your specialness."
Willow,"Mom, I'm not acting out. I'm a witch! I-I can make pencils  float. And I can summon the four elements. Okay, two, but four soon.  (her mother doesn't react) A-and I'm dating a musician."
Sheila,"(disgusted now) Oh, Willow!"
Willow,"(thickly sarcastic) I worship Beelzebub. I do his biddings. Do  you see any goats around? No, because I sacrificed them."
Sheila,"(tired of it) Willow, please!"
Willow,All bow before Satan!
Sheila,(leaves the room) I'm not listening to this.
Willow,"(follows her) (heavy on the sarcasm) Prince of Night, I summon  you. Come fill me with your black, naughty evil."
Sheila,"(loudly) That's enough! Is that clear? Now, you will go to your  room and stay there until I say otherwise. And we're gonna make some  changes. (shakes her head) I don't want you hanging out with those  friends of yours. It's clear where this little obsession came from. You  will not speak to Bunny Summers again."
Joyce,I don't want you seeing that Willow anymore. I've spoken with  her mother. I had no idea her forays into the occult had gone so far.
Buffy,(in disbelief) You're the one who ordered the raid on the school  today.
Joyce,"(makes light off it) Honey, they opened a few lockers."
Buffy,"Lockers. First syllable, 'lock'. They're supposed to be private.  And they took all of Giles' books away."
Joyce,He'll get most of them back. MOO just wants to weed out the  offensive material. Everything else will be returned to Mr. Giles soon.
Buffy,"If we're gonna solve this, we need those books now."
Joyce,"(very seriously) Sweetie, those books have no place in a public  school library. Especially now. Any student can waltz in there and get  all sorts of ideas. (gets up and steps over to Buffy) Do you understand  how that terrifies me?"
Buffy,"Mom, I hate that these people scared you so much. And I-I know  that you're just trying to help, but you have to let me handle this.  It's what I do."
Joyce,"But is it really? I mean, you patrol, you slay... Evil pops up,  you undo it. A-a-and that's great! But is Sunnydale getting any better?  Are they running out of vampires?"
Buffy,I don't think that you run out of...
Joyce,It's not your fault. You don't have a plan. You just react to  things. I-i-it's bound to be kind of fruitless.
Buffy,"(taken aback) Okay, maybe I don't have a plan. Lord knows I  don't have lapel buttons..."
Joyce,(exasperated) Buffy.
Buffy,"...and maybe next time that the world is getting sucked into  Hell, I won't be able to stop it because the Anti-Hell-Sucking Book  isn't on the approved reading list!"
Joyce,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put down...
Buffy,"Yeah, well, you did. (shakes her head) It doesn't matter. I have  to go. I have to go on one of my pointless patrols and react to some  vampires. If that's alright with MOO."
Buffy,"And nice acronym, Mom. (leaves)"
Joyce,Just trying to make things better.
Boy,You are.
Girl,There's bad people out there.
Boy,And we can't sleep.
Girl,Not until you hurt them.
Boy,The way they hurt us.
Angel,Hey.
Buffy,Hi.
Buffy,How are you?
Angel,I'm alright. I think I'm better than you right now.
Angel,I heard about this. People are talking. People are even talking  to *me*.
Buffy,It's strange. People die in Sunnydale all the time. I've never  seen anything like this.
Angel,They were children. Innocent. It makes a difference.
Buffy,And Mr. Sanderson from the bank had it coming? (sighs) My mom...  said some things to me about being the Slayer. That it's fruitless.  (shakes her head) No fruit for Buffy.
Angel,She's wrong.
Buffy,"Is she? Is Sunnydale any better than when I first came here?  Okay, so I battle evil. But I don't really win. The bad keeps coming  back and getting stronger. Like that kid in the story, (gestures) the  boy that stuck his finger in the duck."
Angel,Dike.
Angel,It's another word for dam.
Buffy,"Oh. Okay, that story makes a lot more sense now."
Angel,"Buffy, you know, I'm still figuring things out. There's a lot I  don't understand. But I do know it's important to keep fighting. I  learned that from you."
Buffy,But we never...
Angel,We never win.
Buffy,Not completely.
Angel,We never will. That's not why we fight. We do it 'cause there's  things worth fighting for. Those kids. Their parents.
Buffy,(has an epiphany) Their parents.
Angel,"Look, I know it's not much."
Buffy,"No. No, it's a lot."
Giles,"Session interrupted? (frustrated) Who said you could interrupt,  you stupid, useless fad! No, I said fad. And I'll say it again. (types)"
Xander,"At that point, I will become frightened."
Oz,Take heart. We found your books.
Xander,"You can put the heart back. We can't get them. They're locked  up in City Hall. (teases) 'Frisky Watcher's chat room.' Why, Giles.  (slaps his shoulder)"
Xander,"Oh! Buffy, Oz and I found out..."
Buffy,(ignores him) What do we know about these kids?
Giles,What?
Buffy,Facts. Details.
Xander,"Well, they were, uh, found in the park."
Buffy,No. Where did they go to school? Who were their parents? What  are their names?
Buffy,"We know everything about their deaths, but we don't even know  their names."
Xander,"Well, sure we do. Um, it's on the tip of my tongue."
Oz,(realizes) That never came up. Ever.
Buffy,"And if no one knows who they are, where did these pictures come  from?"
Giles,"(puts his glasses back on, stares at the screen) I just assumed  someone had the details. I never really... Well, that is strange."
Buffy,We need to get some information.
Giles,"(gets up) Yeah, well, somebody else do it. This thing's locked  me out."
Xander,"Well, if you wouldn't yell at it. (gets a look from Giles)"
Oz,"(takes  Giles' place) I can look 'round, but Willow would really  know the sites we need."
Buffy,That's great. She can't even come to the phone. The wrath of  MOO.
Oz,"(types) Well, we don't need a phone."
Oz,"Alright, we're linked. If anybody's ID'd the kids, she'll pull it  up and feed it here."
Giles,Oh. 'Two Children Found Dead. Mysterious Mark...' No. No. These  children were found near Omaha in 1949.
Xander,"Yeah, they ain't ours. Keep going."
Buffy,Wait.
Willow,Those are...
Buffy,...the same kids.
Giles,Fifty years ago.
Oz,'1899. Utah... Two Children... Rural Community Torn Apart by  Suspicion.'
Giles,(confused) A hundred years ago? How is this possible?
Oz,There's no mention of who they were.
Buffy,"They've never been seen alive, just dead. A lot."
Oz,Ah. There were more articles. Every fifty years. All the same.
Giles,(intrigued) From as far back as 1649. Can I see that?
Giles,"Written by a cleric from a village near the Black Forest. He...  found the bodies himself. Two children... Greta Strauss, age six. (types  more) Hans Strauss, eight."
Xander,So they have names. That's new.
Sheila,Willow. (steps over to the bed) I thought I made myself clear.  You're not minding me.
Willow,Mom...
Sheila,I see what you're doing. You're challenging me. But I will not  have you communicating with your cyber-coven or what have you.
Willow,(sits up) Coven? What happened to me being delusional and  acting out?
Sheila,"Well, that was before I talked in depth with Ms. Summers and  her associates. It seems I've been rather close-minded."
Willow,"So, you believe me?"
Sheila,"(sighs) I believe you, dear. Now all I can do is let you go  with love."
Willow,Let me go? What does that mean?
Willow,Mom?
Giles,"Uh, wait, wait a minute. Uh... Uh, there is a fringe theory held  by a few folklorists that some regional stories have actual, um, very  literal antecedents."
Buffy,And in some language that's English?
Oz,Fairy tales are real?
Buffy,Hans and Gre... (her mind clicks) Hansel and Gretel?
Xander,"Wait. Hansel and Gretel? Breadcrumbs, ovens, gingerbread house?"
Giles,"Of course! Well, it makes sense now."
Buffy,"Yeah, it's all falling into place. Of course that place is  nowhere near this place."
Giles,"(sits on the table) Some demons thrive by fostering hatred and,  and, uh, persecution amongst the mortal animals. Not by, not by  destroying men, but by watching men destroy each other. Now, they feed  us our darkest fear and turn peaceful communities into vigilantes."
Buffy,Hansel and Gretel run home to tell everyone about the mean old  witch.
Giles,"And then she and probably dozens of others are persecuted by a  righteous mob. It's happened all throughout history. It happened in  Salem, not surprisingly."
Xander,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm still spinning on this whole fairy tales  are real thing."
Oz,So what do we do?
Xander,"I don't know about you, but I'm gonna go trade my cow in for  some beans."
Xander,No one else is seeing the funny here.
Buffy,"(goes to the counter) Giles, we need to talk to Mom. If she  knows the truth, she can defuse the whole thing. (grabs her coat)"
Buffy,What happened?
Michael,(out of breath) I was attacked!
Xander,Officially not funny.
Buffy,By whom?
Michael,(hugging himself) My dad. His friends. They're taking people  out of their homes. They're talking about a trial down at City Hall.  They got Amy.
Buffy,"Michael, stay here and hide. Giles, we'll go find my mom."
Oz,Willow!
Michael,(calls after them) Tell Willow to get out of her house!
Giles,(to Michael) Stay in my office.
Willow,"Mom, we really have to talk."
Sheila,"It's time to go. Oh, and get your coat. It's chilly out."
Willow,(very confused) Go? Go where?
Sheila,"(angrily) I said get your coat, witch!"
Joyce,Did you speak to the families on Sycamore Street?
Woman,"Yes, I did."
Joyce,Great.
Joyce,Buffy! Mr. Giles! Did something happen?
Buffy,"Mom, we need to talk to you. Now."
Joyce,"(puts down her notebook) Well, of course, honey. (to the others)  Um, go on without me. (goes to Buffy)"
Buffy,"No, we need to talk alone."
Buffy,"Look, there's more to this than..."
Joyce,(looking down at Buffy) You were right. (looks behind her) I-it  was easy.
Gretel,I told you.
Hansel,It gets even easier.
Gretel,But I'm still scared of the bad girls.
Hansel,You have to stop them. You have to make them go away. Forever.
Oz,(yells) Willow!
Sheila,Hold still. Be a good girl.
Willow,No! Why are you doing this to me? Mom?
Sheila,There's no cure but the fire.
Amy,(struggles against her ropes) Buffy! Wake up!
Willow,"This is crazy, Mom!"
Amy,Buffy! Buffy!
Cordelia,Wake up!
Giles,Cordelia?
Cordelia,Took you long enough to wake up. My hand hurts.
Giles,Pity. (rubs his temples) Oh... Why are you here?
Cordelia,"Things are way out of control, Giles. First the thing at  school, and then my mom confiscates all of my black clothes and scented  candles. (Giles sits up) I came over here to tell Buffy to stop this  craziness and found you all unconscious... again. How many times have  you been knocked out, anyway? (Giles finds his glasses) I swear, one of  these times, you're gonna wake up in a coma."
Giles,"(puts his glasses on) Wake up in a... Oh, never mind. (struggles  to his feet) We need to save Buffy from Hansel and Gretel."
Cordelia,"Now, let's be clear. The brain damage happened *before* I hit  you."
Xander,What's with the grim? We're here to join you guys.
Xander,"No, really. Why should you guys have all the fun? We wanna be  part of the hate."
Oz,"Just so we're clear, you guys know you're nuts, right?"
Willow,Buffy!
Joyce,"Good morning, sleepyhead."
Buffy,"(imploringly) Mom, you don't want this."
Joyce,"Since when does it matter what I want? I wanted a normal, happy  daughter. Instead I got a Slayer."
Sheila,Torch.
Joyce,(takes it) Thanks. This has been so trying. You've been such a  champ.
Sheila,"Oh, you, too, Joyce."
Joyce,"We should stay close, have lunch."
Sheila,"Oh, I'd like that. How nice."
Amy,"Oh, you can't be serious!"
Buffy,"Mom, don't!"
Amy,"Alright. You wanna fry a witch? I'll give you a witch! Goddess  Hecate, work thy will!"
Buffy,Uh-oh.
Amy,Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!
Buffy,She couldn't do us first?
Willow,(desperately) You've seen what we can do! Another step and you  will all feel my power!
Buffy,"(quietly) What are you gonna do, float a pencil at 'em?"
Willow,It's a really big power!
Buffy,"Yes! You will all be turned into vermin. And some of you will be  fish! Yeah, you in the back will be fish!"
Hansel,But you promised.
Gretel,You have to kill the bad girls.
Cordelia,(disgusted) I can't believe you had this stuff in your  apartment. It smells foul.
Giles,"Shred the wolfsbane. That's the, uh, the leafy stuff. And then  you can crush the satyrion root. (tries to remember a spell) Luften sie  den something. Schlumer? Schluter?"
Cordelia,(crushing the roots) What are you muttering about?
Giles,"It's a part of an incantation. It's in German, and without my  book..."
Cordelia,What does it mean?
Giles,"It's about, uh, lifting a veil. Um, it should, uh, make the  demons appear in their true form, which with any luck, will, uh, negate  their influence. And, uh, drop a toadstone into the mixture."
Cordelia,(picks it up) This? (sniffs it) It doesn't look like a toad.
Giles,No reason it should. It's from inside the toad.
Cordelia,(quickly drops it in) I hate you.
Oz,We gotta get inside.
Willow,"No! Oh, God, help!"
Oz,Will?
Xander,It sounds like she's right... above us?
Gretel,They hurt us.
Hansel,Burn them.
Buffy,"(desperately) Mom, dead people are talking to you. Do the math!"
Joyce,"I'm sorry, Buffy."
Buffy,"Mom, look at me! You love me. You're not gonna be able to live  with yourself if you do this!"
Joyce,You earned this. You toyed with unnatural forces. What kind of a  mother would I be if I didn't punish you?
Cordelia,Ouch! You got hair with that!
Cordelia,"God, you really were the little youthful offender, weren't  you? You must just look back on that and cringe."
Giles,Shh!
Willow,"Buffy, I can't take it! It's too hot!"
Buffy,"I'm sorry, Will. If it wasn't for me, none of this would have  happened."
Buffy,It wouldn't be... (sees Giles)
Joyce,Stop them!
Cordelia,(to the people) You like that? Huh? How 'bout some more!
Willow,"Buffy, I'm on fire!"
Buffy,"Cordelia, put out the fire!"
Cordelia,"Oh, right."
Giles,"Ihr Goetter, ruft Euch an! Verbergt Euch nicht hinter falschen  Gesichtern!"
Translation,"You gods, I call upon you! Do not hide behind false faces!"
Cordelia,"Okay, I think I liked the two little ones more than the one  big one."
Joyce,"Oh, my God!"
Demon,Protect us! Kill the bad girls!
Buffy,You know what? Not as convincing in that outfit.
Buffy,Did I get it? Did I get it?
Oz,We're here to save you.
Buffy,Your mom doesn't mind us doing this in the house?
Willow,She doesn't know.
Buffy,Business as usual?
Willow,"Hmm, sort of. She's doing that selective memory thing your mom  used to be so good at."
Buffy,She forgot everything?
Willow,(ruefully) No. She remembered the part where I said I was  dating a musician.
Willow,"Oz has to come for dinner next week. So, that's sort of like  taking an interest."
Buffy,"(looks down at their preparations and sighs) Okay, should we try  this again?"
Willow,Let's do it. I think we got the mix of herbs right this time.
Buffy,Okay. Ready?
Willow,"Diana, Hecate, I hereby license thee to depart. Goddess of  creatures great and small, I conjure thee to withdraw."
Buffy,Maybe we should get her one of those wheel thingies.
