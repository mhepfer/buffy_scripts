character,dialogue
Cordelia,I just love springtime.
Cordelia,Me and bright spring fashions!
Mitch,Spring training.
Cordelia,Me at the end of school dance.
Harmony,The end of school.
Cordelia,"Definitely. My favorite time of year. (giggles) I am, of  course, having my dress specially made. Off the rack gives me hives."
Mitch,"Lemme guess: blue, like your eyes! (laughs)"
Cordelia,"(laughs) My eyes are hazel, Helen Keller."
Harmony,You two will look so fine together in the May Queen photo.
Cordelia,"Well, I haven't been elected May Queen yet."
Cordelia,"Uhhh! Behold, the weirdness!"
Buffy,"(looks up) You're probably wondering what I'm doing with this  stuff, huh?"
Cordelia,"Wow, I'm not!"
Buffy,"Uh, for history class. Mr. Giles has this, like, hobby of  collecting stuff... which he lent me... for show and tell. D-did I  mention it's for history class?"
Harmony,She is always hanging with that creepy librarian in that  creepy library.
Cordelia,"(to Mitch) Hey, did I ever tell you about the time that she  attacked me? At the Bronze? I don't know why this school admits mentals  like her."
Cordelia,"Well, how about color me totally self-involved?"
Cordelia,"Yeah. With Shylock it's whine, whine, whine, like the whole  world is about him. He acts like it's justice, him getting a pound of  Antonio's flesh. It's not justice, it's yicky."
Willow,"Well, everyone looked down on him."
Cordelia,"That is such a twinkie defense. Shylock should get over  himself. People who think their problems are so huge craze me. Like this  time I sort of ran over this girl on her bike. It was the most  traumatizing event of *my* life, and she's trying to make it about *her*  leg! Like *my* pain meant nothing."
Cordelia,Ms. Miller?
Cordelia,"Thanks. Um, I wanna talk to you about my final paper. I'm  real unfocused. I have all these thoughts, and I'm pretty sure they all  contradict each other."
Cordelia,That'd be great! Thanks a lot. (starts to leave)
Cordelia,Okay! Bye! (goes into the hall) Harmony!
Harmony,Hi!
Cordelia,They called and said the dress is ready. It's so great! Mitch  is gonna die!
Bud,"Hey, Mitch! You goin' to the Bronze?"
Mitch,Later. I'm pickin' up my tux first.
Bud,Uh huh.
Mitch,Gotta look sharp for the big dig.
Bud,"Oh, that's right! You gotta look good to be on Cordelia's arm!"
Mitch,"Oh, it's not her arm I'm lookin' to be on. (laughs)"
Mitch,Who's there?
Mitch,"Okay, fun time's over, come out."
Cordelia,"Now, remember who to vote for for May Queen! As in me!"
Boy,Thanks.
Cordelia,Hi! Isn't this the bomb? I'm such the campaign strategist.
Harmony,'C'. For Cordelia?
Cordelia,"No, 'C' for Wilma, little brain! Of course, 'C' for Cordelia!  This way people will associate me with something sweet!"
Cordelia,Here's a chocolate... (sees it's Buffy and pulls her hand  back) Oh. I don't think I need the loony-fringe vote. (leaves)
Buffy,"Well, I-I don't even *like* chocolates. (to herself) Okay, that  was the lamest comeback of our times."
Xander,"So, what's Cordelia up to?"
Buffy,Bribery. She's desperate to be May Queen.
Xander,"Cordelia, man, she does love titles!"
Willow,"(reminded by that, laughing hysterically) Oh, God! Remember in  sixth grade with the field trip?"
Xander,Right! Right! The guy with the antlers on his belt!
Willow,Be my Deputy!
Xander,"And remember the, the hat?"
Willow,Oh God! The hat!
Buffy,"Gee, it's fun that we're speaking in tongues."
Willow,I'm sorry. (calms down)
Xander,"It's just that we had this, uh... You had to be there."
Willow,It's not even funny.
Xander,Really.
Willow,"Uh, Cordelia just has a history of trying too hard."
Xander,"Yeah, what kind of moron would wanna be May Queen anyway?"
Buffy,(turns to her locker) I was.
Xander,You what?
Buffy,At my old school.
Xander,"Oh! So the, uh, *good* kind of moron would do that. The, uh,  non-moron, I mean."
Buffy,"(closes her locker and turns back) Well, we didn't call it 'May  Queen', but we had the coronation, and the dance, and all that stuff. It  was nice."
Xander,"Well, you know, you don't need that anymore. You got us!"
Willow,"(cracks up again) Be my Deputy! Oh, God..."
Bud,Guys! C'mon! (Buffy looks up) Mitch got whaled on! I think he's...
Snyder,"Dead? Of course not. What are you, ghouls?"
Snyder,"There are no dead students here. This week. Clear back, make  room, all of you."
Buffy,"Mitch, what happened?"
Mitch,"I don't know. I, I heard something. I tried to grab a, a bat...  (guffaws, unable to believe what he's saying) that hit me."
Buffy,What hit you?
Mitch,"The bat! By itself, the thing was floating, it knocked me out."
Buffy,(to Xander) I'd better check out the scene. (starts toward the  locker room)
Snyder,Where do you think you're going?
Buffy,"(stops and faces him) Um, Mitch wanted me to get his comb. He,  he likes his comb."
Snyder,I don't think Mitch needs his comb right now. I think Mitch  needs medical attention.
Snyder,And you need to stay away from the crime scene. Always sticking  your nose in.
Willow,(loudly) Sue? What did you say? Mitch was gonna sue the school?
Snyder,(diverted by Willow) Sue? Who?
Xander,"Well, his dad is the most powerful lawyer in Sunnydale."
Snyder,Hold on. What have you two heard?
Xander,"His dad, the lawyer. You haven't heard of him?"
Willow,Other lawyers call him 'The Beast'.
Willow,'Look'? That's all it said?
Xander,Look at what? Look at Mitch?
Buffy,Maybe. All I know is it's a message.
Xander,And...
Giles,"(finds them) Ah, here you are."
Buffy,"And monsters don't usually send messages. It's pretty much  crush, kill, destroy. This was different."
Giles,I'd have to say you're right.
Buffy,I love it when he says that! Any theories?
Giles,"(takes a seat) Uh, I'm, uh, it's a bit of a puzzle, really. Um,  I've never actually heard of anyone attacked by a lone baseball bat  before."
Xander,"Maybe it's a vampire bat. (no response from the others) I'm  alone with that one, huh?"
Giles,"Well, assuming the bat itself is not possessed, uh, there are a  few possibilities that bear investigating. Uh, someone with telekinesis,  uh, the power to move objects at will, uh, uh, an invisible creature,  um, or possibly a poltergeist."
Willow,A ghost?
Giles,"Yes, and a very angry one."
Buffy,"Yeah, I'd say. The locker room was a real scene."
Willow,"If it's a ghost, then we're talking about a dead kid."
Buffy,"I guess so. You know, why don't you compile a list of dead or  missing kids? It's probably a good place to start."
Giles,"And, uh, I'll research all the possibilities, ghosts included.  But, uh, Xander, if you're not doing anything, would you like to help  me?"
Xander,"What, so there's homework now? When did that happen?"
Buffy,It's all part of the glamorous world of vampire slayage.
Xander,"Well, what part do you have?"
Buffy,Gonna find out what I can about Mitch. This attack wasn't  random.
Xander,"Well, I want that part."
Buffy,"Fine. You can do it. Ask around, talk to his friends. Talk to  Cordelia!"
Xander,"Talk to Cordelia? (to Giles) So, research, huh?"
Harmony,Hi!
Cordelia,"Oh, hi."
Harmony,"Cordelia, you weren't in fifth period."
Cordelia,I went to the hospital.
Harmony,"Oh, Mitch. How is he? Will he be okay?"
Cordelia,"Well, the doctor says he'll be fine. They're gonna send him  home tomorrow. But... you should've seen him lying there. All black and  blue? How's he gonna look in our Prom pictures? How am I ever gonna be  able to show them to anyone?"
Harmony,"Well, they can do wonderful things with airbrushes these days."
Cordelia,You think?
Harmony,Hi!
Cordelia,"Hi! Did you see Mitch? He just broke up with Wendy eight  seconds ago, and he's already nosing around."
Harmony,It's shameless!
Cordelia,"In the spring, if he makes varsity baseball, maybe I'll take  him on a test drive."
Marcie,"Hi, guys!"
Cordelia,What do *you* want?
Cordelia,I just hope they can prop him up long enough to take the  picture.
Buffy,"(from the door) Cordelia, can I talk to you?"
Cordelia,"Oh, great."
Harmony,Why is she always try... Uff!
Cordelia,Harmony!
Snyder,"Oh, for heaven sakes! Clear back, everyone! Give her some air!  (to a student) You! School nurse, now!"
Harmony,"Ow! Oh, my ankle! I think it's broken."
Buffy,What happened?
Snyder,(to Buffy) Hey! Who's the principal here? (to Harmony) What  happened?
Cordelia,"She fell! She, she, we were standing at the top of the stairs  and she just fell! All by herself!"
Harmony,No! I was pushed!
Harmony,Ow!
Snyder,Don't sue.
Buffy,Is anybody here?
Buffy,Hey! Who's here?
Buffy,"Okay, I know someone's here. Look, I'm not gonna hurt you. I  just wanna talk to you."
Buffy,"Giles, have you ever touched a ghost?"
Giles,"Uh, no. From what I've heard, uh, having a, a ghost pass through  you is a singular experience. It's a, it's a rather, uh, cold amorphous  feeling. It makes your hair stand on end."
Buffy,"You see, that's my problem. I touched the thing, but it didn't  go through me. It bumped into me. And it wasn't cold."
Xander,"So, we're talking about what, an invisible person?"
Buffy,A girl. She laughed.
Giles,A girl on campus with the ability to become invisible.
Xander,That is so cool!
Willow,Cool?
Xander,"Well, yeah, I would give anything to be able to turn invisible.  Well, I wouldn't use my powers to beat people up, but I'd use my powers  to protect the girls' locker room."
Giles,It must be a fairly heady experience... having that ability.
Willow,How'd she get it? Is she a witch? 'Cause we can fight a witch.
Xander,"Hmm. Greek myths speak of cloaks of invisibility, but they're  usually for the gods. (gets looks from everyone) Research Boy comes  through with the knowledge!"
Buffy,This girl's sorta petty for a god.
Willow,She's got a grudge. But why Harmony?
Xander,Harmony and Mitch. The common denominator is...
Buffy,Cordelia!
Willow,So what now?
Buffy,"First thing tomorrow, why don't you pull up that missing kids  list?"
Willow,Got it. I'll see ya then.
Buffy,Bye.
Xander,"See ya. (leaves with Willow) Oh, hey, do you wanna come to our  place tonight for dinner? Mom's making her famous phone call to the  Chinese place."
Willow,"Xander, do you guys even have a stove?"
Giles,"(to Buffy) So, I'll look into ways that you can de-cloak an  invisible someone. What about you?"
Buffy,I think Cordelia's gonna be workin' on her May Queen dress  tonight. Maybe there'll be some action. Guess I'm gonna start the hunt.
Giles,How exactly do you propose to hunt someone you can't see?
Giles,You may have to work on listening to people.
Buffy,Very funny.
Giles,I thought so.
Cordelia,Should I wear my hair up? Do you think I should wear it up?
Cordelia,"How does the, um, hem go? Is it, is it long enough, or..."
Cordelia,Isn't it beautiful?
Giles,Who's there?
Giles,(exhales) A vampire casts no reflection.
Angel,Don't worry. I'm not here to eat.
Giles,Buffy told me you don't feed from humans anymore.
Angel,Not for a long while.
Giles,Is that why you're here? To see her?
Angel,"I can't. It's, uh... It's too hard for me to be around her."
Giles,"A vampire in love with a Slayer! It's rather poetic! In a  maudlin sort of way. What can I, uh... What can I do for you?"
Angel,I know you've been researching the Master.
Giles,"Yes, the vampire king. I've tried to learn as much as I can  about him for the day that Buffy must face him."
Angel,"Something's already in motion, something big, but I don't know  what. You've read all the Slayer lore there is, right?"
Giles,"I-I've studied all the extant volumes, of course. But the, uh,  most salient books of Slayer prophecy have been lost. The Tiberius  Manifesto, the Pergamum Codex..."
Angel,The Codex?
Giles,"It's reputed to have contained the most complete prophecies  about the Slayer's role in the end years. Unfortunately, the book was  lost in the 15th century."
Angel,Not lost. Misplaced. I can get it.
Giles,"(exhales, astounded) That would be most helpful! Uh, m-my own  volumes have... been rather useless of late."
Angel,(looks at Giles' book) Legends of Vishnu?
Giles,(a bit embarrassed) There's an... invisible girl terrorizing the  school.
Angel,That's not really my area of expertise.
Giles,"Nor mine, I'm afraid. Uh, it's fascinating, though. By all  accounts it's a, a... a wonderful power to possess."
Angel,"Oh, I don't know. Looking in the mirror everyday and seeing  nothing there. (cut to Giles' reflection) It's an overrated pleasure."
Cordelia,God! I am never sitting through another one of those alumni  lectures again. Two hours of 'My Trek Through Nepal'. Hello! There is  nobody caring.
Marcie,"And did you guys see his toupee? I mean, it looks like a  cabbage."
Cordelia,"And those slides! 'That's a mountain. That's a mountain, too.  Now look at some mountains.'"
Harmony,"I swear, he had three slides and just used them over and over."
Marcie,"I know, but did you guys see his toupee? I mean, it was, like,  the worst!"
Harmony,"(to Marcie) We're talking, okay?"
Cordelia,"Oh! And did you guys check out that extreme toupee? Yeah,  that's realistic. It looked like a cabbage."
Snyder,The winner is Cordelia Chase!
Snyder,Let's bring up our new May Queen.
Cordelia,"Thank you for making the right choice, and for showing me how  much you all love me. (applause) Being this popular is not just my  right, but my responsibility, and I want you to know I take it very  seriously."
Cordelia,It all began when...
Xander,"So, Giles said you'd be here. Why are you being here?"
Buffy,Last night was a bust. But I still think Cordy's the key.
Willow,"This is the dead and missing list. I pulled up their classes,  activities, medical records..."
Buffy,Good work.
Willow,Has Cordelia hired a bodyguard or something?
Buffy,"Hey, you guys, check out this one. It's the most recent one,  Marcie Ross, disappeared, like, six months ago."
Xander,I don't know her.
Willow,Me neither.
Buffy,Her only activity was band. She played the flute.
Willow,So?
Buffy,"Well, last night when I was hunting, I heard this flute, but I  couldn't figure out where it was coming from. And it was in the band  room that I lost Miss Invisible yesterday. You know what, this all  tracks. I'm gonna check it out. See you guys later?"
Xander,"Okay, we'll see you after geometry."
Cordelia,"(still giving her acceptance speech) Ask not what your school  can do for you, ask: Hey! What am I wearing to the Spring Fling?"
Buffy,Marcie Ross. So it is you.
Cordelia,"Ms. Miller? (sees her) Oh, my God! Ms. Miller! (lifts her up)  Oh, my God! (pulls the bag off) Are you okay?"
Cordelia,"Ms. Miller, what happened?"
Giles,A nest?
Buffy,It looked like she'd been there for months. It's where I found  this.
Willow,"Oh, my God! (reads) 'Have a nice summer. Have a nice summer.'  This girl had no friends at all."
Giles,"Uh, once again I teeter at the precipice of the generation gap."
Buffy,'Have a nice summer' is what you write when you have nothing to  say.
Xander,It's the kiss of death.
Buffy,You guys didn't know Marcie Ross?
Xander,Never met her. Why?
Buffy,"'Cause you both wrote it, too. (points to Xander's signature)"
Xander,'Have a nice...' Yeesh!
Willow,"Where am I? (Buffy points) Oh. 'Have a *great* summer.' See, I  cared!"
Buffy,You guys don't remember her?
Xander,"No, I probably didn't see her except to sign the book. I mean,  this is a big school."
Willow,"(looks at her printouts) Xander, we each had four classes with  her last year."
Buffy,"So, no one noticed her, and now she's invisible."
Xander,"What, she turned invisible because no one noticed her?"
Giles,"(hits the table) Of course! (gets up) I've been investigating  the mystical causes of invisibility when I, I should have looked at the  quantum mechanical! (gets looks from them all) Physics."
Buffy,"I think I speak for everyone here when I say, huh?"
Giles,"(gets a book) It's a rudimentary concept that, that reality is  shaped, even, even... created by our perception."
Buffy,And with the Hellmouth below us sending out mystical energy...
Giles,"People perceived Marcie as, as, as invisible, and, and, and, and  she became so."
Cordelia,"Well, just because the story's about him, doesn't necessarily  mean he's the hero, right?"
Willow,"Well, the protagonist."
Xander,"Why can't he be both? I mean, he did do some things that are  pretty heroic."
Buffy,This isn't this great power that she can control. It's something  that was done to her. That *we* did to her.
Willow,No wonder she's miffed.
Xander,What does she want?
Buffy,Just what we thought. Cordelia.
Cordelia,"What? I knew you'd be here. Buffy, I, uh, I, I know we've had  our differences, with you being so weird and all, and hanging out with  these total losers..."
Cordelia,"Ooo! (exhales) Well, anyway, despite all of that, I know that  you share this feeling that we have for each other, deep down..."
Willow,Nausea?
Cordelia,"Somebody is after me! They just tried to kill Ms. Miller? Uh,  she was helping me with my homework. And Mitch! And Harmony?! This is  all about me! Me, me, me!"
Xander,Wow! For once she's right!
Buffy,So you've come to *me* for help.
Cordelia,"(nods) Because you're always around when all this weird stuff  is happening. And I know you're very strong, and you've got all those  weapons... I was kind of hoping you were in a gang."
Cordelia,Please! I don't have anyone else to turn to!
Giles,Please. Sit down.
Cordelia,Okay. Thanks.
Giles,"You know, I... I don't recall ever seeing you here before."
Cordelia,"Oh, no, I have a life."
Buffy,"Okay. (exhales) Cordelia, your attacker is an invisible girl."
Xander,"Who is really, really angry at you, which I... can't imagine  personally, but it... takes all kinds, y'know?"
Cordelia,"Well, I don't care what it is, just get rid of it!"
Buffy,"Well, it's not that simple, it's a person, it's... (shows her  the yearbook) It's this person. Now, do you have any idea why she'd be  so..."
Cordelia,"Oh, God! Is she really wearing Laura Ashley?"
Xander,So homicidal?
Cordelia,(exhales) I have no idea! I've never seen this girl before in  my life!
Marcie,"(maniacally) I won 'cause you didn't see me coming. Cordelia,  you don't remember me. I remember you, all your idiot slut friends, I  hate them. They take your life and they suck it out of you! But then  they didn't see me coming. They gotta learn. They gotta learn."
Giles,"According to what you told us about the attack on Ms. Miller, we  now have two messages from Marcie: 'look' and 'listen'."
Willow,Messages we don't understand.
Buffy,"I don't think we're supposed to... yet. Marcie's not quite  ready. But from what she did to Cordelia's picture, I would say that  she's wigged on the whole May Queen thing. Maybe she's gonna do  something about it."
Willow,"Stop the coronation tonight, maybe. Keep you guys away from the  Bronze?"
Cordelia,Nothing is keeping me from the Bronze tonight!
Xander,"Uh, can we just revel in your fabulous lack of priorities?"
Cordelia,"If I'm not crowned tonight then, then Marcie's won! And that  would be bad. She's evil, okay? Way eviler than me."
Buffy,Cordelia has a point.
Cordelia,Buffy's with me on this.
Buffy,"Anyway, continuing the normal May Queen activities may be the  best way to draw Marcie out. We can use Cordelia as bait."
Cordelia,Great! Bait?
Giles,"Willow, Xander, you'll help me begin our research anew. Unless  we find a way to cure Marcie's invisibility, then Buffy will be..."
Buffy,A sitting duck.
Buffy,(to Cordelia) C'mon.
Cordelia,"Well, I have to try on my dress. And am I really bait?"
Cordelia,"So, how much the creepy is it that this Marcie's been at this  for months? Spying on us? Learning our most guarded secrets? So, are you  saying she's invisible because she's so unpopular?"
Buffy,That about sums it up.
Cordelia,(exhales) Bummer for her. It's awful to feel that lonely.
Buffy,Hmm.  So you've read something about the feeling?
Cordelia,"(stops Buffy) Hey! You think I'm never lonely because I'm so  cute and popular? I can be surrounded by people and be completely alone.  It's not like any of them really know me. I don't even know if they like  me half the time. People just want to be in a popular zone. Sometimes  when I talk, everyone's so busy agreeing with me, they don't hear a word  I say."
Buffy,"Well, if you feel so alone, then why do you work so hard at  being popular?"
Cordelia,"Well, it beats being alone all by yourself."
Willow,Shhh! Listen!
Giles,Come on.
Giles,We could... talk to her. Perhaps reason with her. Or possibly  grab her.
Willow,There are three of us.
Xander,Let's go!
Cordelia,If you ever tell to anyone that I changed in a mop closet...
Buffy,Your secret dies with me. (looks around) Looks okay. But hurry.
Cordelia,Okay.
Xander,Over here.
Giles,"Marcie? We know what happened to you. Please, can we talk to  you?"
Willow,We're sorry we ignored you.
Xander,Can you say 'gulp'?
Giles,What's that sound?
Buffy,You know what you were saying before? I understand. Somehow it  doesn't seem to matter how popular you are when...
Cordelia,You were popular? In what alternate universe?
Buffy,"In L.A. Th-the point is, I did sort of feel like something was  missing."
Cordelia,Is that when you became weird and got kicked out?
Buffy,Okay. Can we have the heartfelt talk with a little less talk  from you? (no response) Cordelia?
Buffy,Cordelia!
Buffy,Cordelia!
Cordelia,Buffy!
Giles,It's gas. (checks the furnace) She's snuffed out the pilot  light! The gas is on full! (looks around) I can't find the shutoff  valve.
Xander,Is this it?
Willow,"Okay, that's bad. How 'bout the door?"
Giles,NO! One spark and you'll take the whole building with us!
Buffy,"Cordelia! (kneels next to her) Cordelia! (takes her pulse) Oh,  my God!"
Cordelia,Buffy? You're awake?
Buffy,(a bit disoriented) Yeah.
Cordelia,I can't feel my face!
Buffy,What do you mean?
Cordelia,My face. My face is numb. What is she doing?
Buffy,I don't know.
Cordelia,What does that mean?
Buffy,I don't know.
Giles,"That should give us a few minutes, but we b... If we don't get  out of this room soon..."
Willow,Why is Marcie doing this?
Giles,"The loneliness, the constant exile, she's... (coughs) she has  gone mad!"
Xander,Ya think? (coughs)
Marcie,"Uh, I'm disappointed. I'd really hoped you guys had figured it  out by now."
Buffy,"Well, why don't you explain it? C'mon, Marcie, what are we  supposed to learn?"
Cordelia,"Yeah, what do you wanna teach us!"
Marcie,You don't get it. You're not the student. You're the lesson.
Cordelia,What did you do to my face?
Marcie,"Your face. That's what this is all about, isn't it? Your  beautiful face. That's what makes you shine just a little bit brighter  than the rest of us. We all want what you have. To be noticed,  remembered. To be seen."
Cordelia,What are you doing?
Marcie,"Well, I'm fulfilling your fondest wish."
Marcie,I'm gonna give you a face no one will ever forget.
Giles,"One, two, three!"
Giles,Again!
Buffy,"Marcie, you can't do this."
Marcie,What are you gonna do? Slay me?
Buffy,"Marcie, you know this is wrong."
Marcie,"(punches Buffy) You shoulda stayed outta my way. Y'know, I, I  thought, I thought you would understand my vision, but you're just like  them."
Cordelia,(gasps) Please don't do this! (watches the blade float in  front of her) Nooohohoho!
Marcie,"You should be grateful. I mean, people who pass you in the  street are gonna remember you for the rest of their lives."
Marcie,"Children are gonna dream about you. And every one of your, your  friends who comes to the coronation tonight will take the sight of the  May Queen to their graves."
Cordelia,Wait!
Marcie,"No, we really have to get started. The local anesthetic's gonna  wear off soon, and I don't want you to faint. It's less fun if you're  not awake."
Xander,You guys are... I'm blacking out on you.
Marcie,Let me see. I think we should start with your smile. I think it  should be wider.
Cordelia,"Marcie, I know you think I don't understand, but I do!"
Marcie,"Yeah, I'll *bet* you know how I feel. I'm sure you can just be  with all your friends and feel so alone 'cause they don't really know  you. You're just a typical, self-involved, spoiled little brat, and you  think you can charm your way out of this, don't you?! ISN'T THAT WHAT  YOU THINK?!"
Marcie,I see right through you.
Cordelia,"Oh, my God! Get me out of here, please!"
Buffy,(starts working on Cordelia's ropes) Hold still!
Cordelia,"(crying) Uh, huh, huh, oh, my God!"
Angel,Come on!
Xander,What happened?
Angel,You tell me.
Willow,"(waking up) I'm up, mom."
Xander,(notices Angel) Hi! What do you want?
Angel,I brought you the Codex. (hands the book to Giles) I came in  through the basement. I smelled the gas.
Giles,"Yes, w-w-well shut it off, otherwise, uh, the whole building  will go up!"
Angel,I'll get it. It's not like I need the oxygen.
Giles,"Come on, let's get out of here."
Buffy,"Y'know, I really felt sorry for you. You've suffered. There's  one thing I really didn't factor into all this. You're a thundering  loony!"
Cordelia,"Buffy, are you okay?"
Cordelia,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
Cordelia,(screams) Buffy!
Cordelia,"(screams) Buffy! Oh, my God!"
Marcie,"Hey, moron! I'm invisible! (knocks Buffy down) How are you  gonna fight someone you can't see?"
Cordelia,"Oh, my God!"
Buffy,"Cordelia, shut up."
Cordelia,(meekly) Okay.
Buffy,I see you.
Agent,Everybody stay where you are.
Doyle,(gun drawn) FBI! Nobody move!
Manetti,"(holds out his hand to keep Buffy back) Okay, we'll take it  from here now, ma'am. (helps Marcie up)"
Buffy,Take what from where?
Doyle,"I'm agent Doyle, this is Agent Manetti. We're here for the girl."
Buffy,"Well, where were you ten minutes ago when she was playing  surgeon?"
Doyle,"I'm sorry, we came as fast as we could."
Marcie,"(to herself) Oh, my God!"
Doyle,(hands Marcie off to another agent) We'll take it from here on.
Agent,C'mon.
Buffy,You can cure her?
Doyle,We can rehabilitate her.
Manetti,In time she'll learn to be a useful member of society again.
Marcie,Where are we going?
Doyle,Very useful.
Buffy,"(realizes) This isn't the first time this has happened, is it?  It's happened at other schools."
Manetti,We're not at liberty to discuss that.
Doyle,It would be best for you to forget this whole incident.
Buffy,Do you know that you guys are very creepy?
Doyle,Thank you for your help.
Manetti,"Oh, and, uh... have a nice day."
Cordelia,Can I get untied now?
Buffy,"I just can't believe how twisted Marcie got. By the way, how did  you guys get out of the boiler room?"
Xander,"Oh, well, when the gas was coming down, we..."
Giles,"Janitor, um, found us. Shut the valve off."
Willow,We were lucky.
Buffy,I'll say.
Cordelia,Hi.
Buffy,Hey!
Cordelia,"Look, um, I didn't get a chance to say anything yesterday  with the coronation and everything... but, um, I guess I just wanted to  say thank you, all of you."
Xander,"That's funny, 'cause she *looks* like Cordelia."
Cordelia,"You really helped me out yesterday, and you didn't have to.  So, thank you."
Buffy,It's okay.
Willow,"Listen, we were gonna grab lunch in a minute if you wanted  to..."
Mitch,"(comes up behind Cordelia) Whoa, whoa. You're not hangin' with  these losers, are you?"
Cordelia,Uhhh! Are you kidding? Heh! (takes his arm and leaves) I was  just being charitable. Helping them with their fashion problems. Heh.  You think I really felt like joining *that* social leper colony? Puh- leeease!
Xander,"Boy, where's an invisible girl when you really need one?"
Doyle,I think you'll be happy here.
Manetti,You should fit right in.
Teacher,"Welcome, Marcie."
Marcie,Hey.
Teacher,"Class, this is Marcie."
Class,"Hi, Marcie."
Teacher,Sit down.
Teacher,"Okay, class, let's get started. Everybody turn to page fifty- four of your texts."
Marcie,Cool!
