GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer...</I>
XANDER,We're getting married.
BUFFY,(to Giles) Did you know about this?
ANYA,He couldn't imagine the rest of his life without me. And then he gave me this.
DEMON,Ante up.
BUFFY,You play for kittens?!
GILES,Have you spoken to Dawn about that incident at Halloween?
BUFFY,I thought you took care of that.
GILES,Right.
BUFFY,What would I do without you?
TARA,"Willow, you are using too much magic. What do you want me to do, just ... sit back and keep my mouth shut?"
WILLOW,"Well, that'd be a good start."
WILLOW,Let's just forget it ever happened.
WILLOW,Forget.
BUFFY,I think I was in heaven. I was torn out of there.
BUFFY,"Pulled out, by my friends."
SPIKE,Can we talk?
BUFFY,"Vocal-cord-wise, yes. With each other? No."
SPIKE,We have to talk.
BUFFY,"(stops walking, sighs) About what?"
SPIKE,"We kissed, Buffy."
BUFFY,So?
SPIKE,"We ... we kissed, you and me. All <I>Gone With The Wind</I>, with the rising music, and the rising ... music, and what was that, Buffy?"
BUFFY,A spell?
SPIKE,"Oh, don't get all prim and proper with me."
SPIKE,I know what kind of girl you really are. (Buffy glaring at him) Don't I.
BUFFY,"What we did is done. But I will never kiss you, Spike. Never touch you ever, *ever* again."
SHARK DEMON,"Easy, boys. No need to get physical-like."
SHARK DEMON,"Is there, Mister Spike?"
BUFFY,You know this guy?!
SPIKE,Yeah. (to demon) Whadda you want?
SHARK DEMON,"(walks forward) You know me, uh ... there are a lot of things I would like, Mister Spike. (pulls the stake out of the tree) A house in Bel Air ... (walks toward Spike) with a generously sized swimming pool ... and of course, the forty Siamese that you owe me."
SPIKE,"Take it easy, you'll get your kittens. (Buffy rolls her eyes)"
SHARK DEMON,"Oh, I trust you, Mister Spike. (lets him go)"
BUFFY,"Oh god, what is it with you guys? Why kittens? Why can't you just use money like everybody else?"
SHARK DEMON,(to Spike) She's funny. I like funny in a girl.
SPIKE,I just need a little more time.
SHARK DEMON,"Time, time, time! Is what turns kittens into cats! Look, I don't wanna see anyone get hurt. (turns away) Boys."
BUFFY,Then you'd better close your eyes.
VAMP 1,"I said she was the Slayer, boss."
SHARK DEMON,"Ahh, good for you. The vampire slayer. (to Buffy) Have you ever given any thought to, uh, freelance work? A little debt collecting, perhaps?"
BUFFY,No thank you.
VAMP 1,"Boss, he's gone. Spike has split."
SHARK DEMON,"Well, that's what I get for socializing. All right, come on, boys, we'll locate Mister Spike and, uh, *talk* to him a little more."
SHARK DEMON,Oh. It was a genuine pleasure.
BUFFY,"(to herself) If I were to stop saving his life, it would simple things up *so* much."
ANYA,"Do you think she ... walked around on clouds, wearing like ... Birkenstocks and played a harp? 'Cause those are just not flattering. You know, the clonky sandals, not a harp. (softly) I mean, who ... doesn't look good with a harp?"
ANYA,"What? I'm just saying what everyone's thinking, (to Xander) right baby?"
XANDER,You are attractive and have many good qualities.
TARA,It's totally not stupid to wonder what it was like for Buffy. But it could have been any one of a zillion heavenly dimensions. All we know is that ... it was a good place and she was happy there.
WILLOW,And we took her away from that. We wrecked it for her.
XANDER,We didn't wreck. We didn't know.
WILLOW,We didn't wanna know. (Tara looks sadly at her) We were so selfish. *I* was so selfish.
XANDER,"(shakes head) Maybe we were. I just feel weird feeling bad that my friend's not dead. It's ... too mind-boggling. So I've decided to simplify the whole thing. Me like Buffy. Buffy's alive, so, me glad."
TARA,"Not to be Miss Psycho Pep Squad, but we have *got* to stop obsessing about what we did and start trying to make things better for Buffy."
ANYA,I'm with Miss Psycho Pep Squad.
XANDER,"Ah, we need to spend more time with her, just hang out. Maybe have ... weekly dinners over here, or, uh ... a book club. Short books. Videos."
WILLOW,I can fix it. I know a spell.
TARA,(angrily) No! No more spells.
WILLOW,"(to Tara) Then what? This isn't something that's gonna be fixed by a video club. I know I messed up, okay, and ... I wanna fix it."
TARA,"I can't believe that we are talking about this again. You know how powerful magic is, how dangerous. You could hurt someone, you ... you could hurt yourself."
WILLOW,(shaking head) I know a spell that will make her forget she was ever in heaven.
TARA,"(angrily) God, what is wrong with you?!"
XANDER,"(getting up) I'm gonna go get that ... phone you probably don't hear. High-pitched ring, ears like a dog."
ANYA,I'm gonna help you with that.
TARA,Do you think I'm stupid? I know you used that spell on me.
WILLOW,"Tara, I'm sorry, I-"
TARA,Don't! Just ... don't. (shakes head) There's nothing you can say.
WILLOW,"Tara, I didn't mean to-"
TARA,"To what? Violate my mind like that? How could you, Willow? How could you after what Glory did to me?"
WILLOW,"Violate you? I ... I-I didn't ... mean anything like that, I-I, I just wanted us not to fight any more. I love you."
TARA,"If you don't wanna fight, you don't fight. You don't use magic to make a fight disappear."
WILLOW,But I-I just wanted to make things better. Better for us.
TARA,"But you don't get to decide what is better for us, Will. We're in a relationship, we are supposed to decide together."
WILLOW,"Okay. I'm ... I realize I, I did it wrong."
TARA,"You did it the way you're doing everything. When things get rough, you ... you don't even consider the options. You just ... you just do a spell. It's not good for you, Willow. And it's not what magic is for."
WILLOW,(anxious) But I ... I just wanna help people.
TARA,"Maybe that's how it started, but ... you're helping yourself now, fixing things to your liking. Including me."
WILLOW,"Tara, no!"
TARA,(tearfully) I don't think this is gonna work.
WILLOW,"Hey. It is, i-it's working. (Tara just looks at her, looks down) Tara, please. I need you, baby. I need you. I don't need magic, I-I don't, I ... let me prove it to you, okay? I, I will go a month without doing any magic. I won't do a single spell. I swear."
TARA,Go a week. One week without magic.
WILLOW,"(excited) Fine. Fine, that's easy!"
TARA,"(nods, not convinced) Go a week, and then we'll see."
TARA,"I don't know, I just ... think we both need some ... I don't know, space. (Willow looks upset) Oh, I can't believe I'm saying this."
WILLOW,Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
GILES,I have to.
BUFFY,Uh-huh.
GILES,"You have to be strong. I'm, I'm trying to-"
BUFFY,"(jumps up) Trying to, to what? (angrily) Desert me? Abandon me? Leave me all alone when I really need somebody?"
GILES,(quietly) I don't want to leave-
BUFFY,So don't. Please don't.
BUFFY,I can't do this without you.
GILES,"You can. That's why I'm going. As long as I stay you'll always turn to me if there's something comes up that you feel that you can't handle, and I'll step in because, because ... (pause, sighs) Because I can't bear to see you suffer."
BUFFY,Me too. Hate suffering. Had about as much of it as I can take.
GILES,"Believe me, I'm loathe to cause you more, but this..."
GILES,"I've taught you all I can about being a slayer, and your mother taught you what you needed to know about life. (Buffy looks away, pouting) You ... you're not gonna trust that until you're forced to stand alone."
BUFFY,"But why now? Now that you know where I've been, what I'm going through?"
GILES,"Now more than ever. The temptation to give up is gonna be overwhelming, and I can't let-"
BUFFY,"So I won't! No giving up. You can be here, and I can still be strong."
GILES,"Buffy, I've thought this over ... and over. I believe it's the right thing to do."
BUFFY,You're wrong.
Cut to,interior of the Summers house. Angle down the stairs from above. Tara and Dawn stand at the foot of the stairs.
DAWN,"(calls up the stairs) Willow, come on, you ready?"
WILLOW,"Not so much. You go ahead, tell Giles to hold up. I'll be there in a sec."
TARA,(annoyed) Fine. (moves toward the door)
DAWN,Hurry up. You don't wanna miss the lowdown on our latest featured creature.
WILLOW,"For Buffy and Tara, this  I char."
WILLOW,"Let Lethe's Bramble do its chore. Purge their minds of memories grim, of pains from recent slights and sins."
WILLOW,"When the fire goes out, when the crystal turns black, the spell will be cast. (pulls the crystal back) Tabula rasa, tabula rasa, tabula rasa."
DAWN VOICEOVER,So whadda we got?
GILES,(to Dawn) Sorry?
DAWN,"What kind of oogly-boogleys? Lizardy types, or um, zombies, or, or vampires, or what?"
GILES,"(cleaning glasses) There are no oogly-boogleys, Dawn."
WILLOW,Thanks for the jacket. It's cold out there.
XANDER,"Not a problem, the cold only makes me stronger and more macho-like."
GILES,"I'm glad you're here, um..."
GILES,I have something I really have to tell you all. Um ... I know it feels like we've been through this before-
BUFFY,Why don't you just jump to the chase? (gets down from stairs) Tell them that you're-
GILES,Spike?
ANYA,Holy moly.
SPIKE,You need to give me asylum.
XANDER,I'll say.
XANDER,"No need to get cute. (takes off hat, throws it down) It's a disguise. Happens there's a bloke I'd rather not see just now."
SPIKE,"(to Buffy) You met him, I believe. Toothy bloke with the baby-seal breath?"
SPIKE,"Nasty fellow, him. And ugly too."
SPIKE,(OS) He's got a mouthful of choppers just waiting to be yanked out and worn as necklaces.
GILES,"Well, now that we've recovered from Spike's ... sartorial humor, (sighs) I'll jump (glancing at Buffy) to the chase. Um ... I'm headed back to England (Dawn looking surprised) and I plan to stay ... indefinitely."
XANDER,"Now? Not now, I mean, not after ... everything."
GILES,"Yes, now."
ANYA,"For real this time? 'Cause honest to Pete, a young shopkeeper's heart can only take so much ... I mean, not that I want you to go-"
BUFFY,I can't do this.
BUFFY,"I just, I don't think..."
WILLOW,"Buffy, listen."
WILLOW,"I know this must be awful for you, and I, I'm sorry, I ... I'm so sorry for..."
BUFFY,"Sorry. Everybody's sorry. I know that you guys are just trying to help ... but it's just, it's too much. And, and I, I can't take it any more. (tearful) If you guys ... if you guys understood how it felt ... how it feels. It's like I'm dying, it-"
BUFFY,Huh?
XANDER,Hey.
WILLOW,(uncertain) Hey?
GILES,Hello?
DAWN,"Who, who are you people?"
BUFFY,Don't worry.
DAWN,Please don't hurt me! (moves away from Buffy)
BUFFY,"Oh, it's okay. I don't know anyone here either."
DAWN,(nervous) Yeah? Who are you?
BUFFY,"(confused) I, uh...."
XANDER,"(scrambling to his feet) Okay, who are you freaks?"
WILLOW,You don't know me?
XANDER,Not a clue.
WILLOW,"But you were just all like, (imitating him) 'oh, hey.'"
XANDER,"Yeah, 'cause I thought you were a girl and I'd remember, but..."
WILLOW,"(grabs her breasts) Well, I am a girl! I'm ... not sure ... who I am exactly, but..."
XANDER,"(yelling) Okay, why was I on the ground? And why are you all staring at me? Is this some kind of psych test? Am I getting paid for this?"
GILES,(gets up) It's not just you. Does anyone remember anything?
SPIKE,Nope.
GILES,"(smiling) Well, maybe we all got ... terribly drunk and this is some sort of, uh, blackout."
DAWN,(uncertain) I don't think I drink.
ANYA,I-I don't see any booze. I don't feel any head bumps. (looks around) I don't see Allen Funt.
GILES,Who?
XANDER,(panicky) Okay. I'm not panicking. I'm not. I'm not. (everyone looking at him) Stop looking at me like I'm panicking!
BUFFY,"Hey, hey, take it easy, guy. Okay, no one's hurt, right? And, and none of us look all hatchety-murdery, so ... we're probably safe. Here. Wherever here is."
WILLOW,(looks around) Look at this stuff on these shelves. Weird jars of weird stuff.
WILLOW,"Weird books with weird covers, like (picks up a book from the counter) <I>Magic for Beginners</I>. (revelation) Oh!"
TARA,(gets up) This is a magic shop. A-a-a real magic shop.
BUFFY,"Well, maybe that's it. Maybe something magic happened-"
GILES,"(scoffs) Magic! Magic's all balderdash and chicanery. I'm afraid we don't know a bloody thing. (everyone looking at him) Except I seem to be British, don't I? Uh, and a man. With ... glasses. (removes glasses) Well, that narrows it down considerably."
DAWN,(tearfully to Buffy) I don't like this.
BUFFY,"It's okay, don't worry. We'll take care of each other."
GILES,"We'll all get our memory back, and it'll all be right as rain."
SPIKE,"Oh, listen to Mary Poppins. He's got his crust all stiff and upper with that nancy-boy accent. (everyone looking at him) You Englishmen are always so... (pauses) Bloody hell! (ticks off on his fingers) Sodding, blimey, shagging, knickers, bollocks, oh God! I'm English!"
GILES,(puts glasses on) Welcome to the nancy tribe.
SPIKE,"You don't suppose you and I ... we're not related, are we?"
ANYA,There is a ruggedly handsome resemblance.
GILES,"(to Spike) And you do inspire a, um ... (Spike walking out from behind the counter) particular feeling of ... familiarity and ... disappointment."
GILES,Older brother?
SPIKE,"(scoffs) Father. (Giles looks outraged) Oh, god, how I must hate you."
GILES,What did I do?
SPIKE,"There's always something, and what's with the trollop? (indicates Anya)"
ANYA,Hey!
GILES,Her?
SPIKE,I saw you! Sleeping together.
GILES,Resting together.
ANYA,Look! (holds up her hand with the engagement ring) It's okay. We're engaged.
GILES,(smiling) Oh.
ANYA,It's a lovely ring.
SPIKE,"Oh, great, a tarty stepmom who's half old Daddy's age."
ANYA,Tarty?
GILES,"Old? You little twerp, I'm young enough to still get carded."
WILLOW,Carded! Driver's licenses!
XANDER,"(looks at his wallet) It's me! 'Alexander Harris.' Cute picture. (holds it up to them) Hey, I exist."
WILLOW,"I'm Willow Rosenberg. (looks at Xander) Heh, Willow. Funny name."
TARA,I think it's pretty.
WILLOW,(smiles at Tara) Whadda you got?
TARA,"(holds up her I.D.) Tara, and look, I'm a student at U.C. Sunnydale."
WILLOW,"Me too! Hey, maybe we're study buddies. (Tara smiles)"
DAWN,(to Buffy) I don't have a wallet.
BUFFY,"Don't worry. Me neither. But here, look."
BUFFY,You're Dawn.
DAWN,"(smiles) Or, Umad."
GILES,"I'm, uh, called Rupert Giles."
ANYA,(smiling fondly) Rupert.
SPIKE,Rupert! (giggles)
GILES,"You're not too old to put across my knee, you know ... sonny. (Spike still laughing) Anyway, what did I call you?"
SPIKE,Um...
SPIKE,"'Made with care for Randy.' (looks at Giles angrily) Randy Giles? Why not just call me 'Horny Giles,' or 'Desperate for a Shag Giles'? I knew there was a reason I hated you!"
GILES,"Randy's ... a family name, undoubtedly."
WILLOW,"Oh, hey, I have a name on my jacket. (takes off jacket to look) Harris."
XANDER,Harris? That's my last name. Maybe I have a brother and you go out with him. (Willow looking uncertain) Or maybe you go out with me.
WILLOW,"Well, we did wake up all snuggly-wuggly. (walks closer to him) Maybe you're my boyfriend."
XANDER,"Either that, or I got one pissed-off brother out there somewhere. (both smile)"
ANYA,I'm Anya!
Everyone looks over at Anya by the cash register. [Note,Anya pronounces her name wrong.]
ANYA,"Um, this key fits this lock. And, uh, the forms ... next to the cash register say that, uh, Rupert and, and Anya own the shop together."
GILES,"This is *our* magic shop? (goes over to Anya) Uh, well, that's very, uh, uh, progressive of me."
DAWN,(to Buffy) So you don't have a name?
BUFFY,Of course I do. I just don't happen to know it.
DAWN,(smiling) You want me to name you?
"BUFFY: Oh, that's sweet, but I think I can name myself. (thinks) I'll name me ... Joan. [transcriber's note",great choice!]
DAWN,(makes a face) Ugh!
BUFFY,What? Did you just 'ugh' my name?
DAWN,"No! I just ... I mean, it's so blah. Joan?"
BUFFY,I like it. I feel like a Joan.
DAWN,"(chuckles) Fine, that's your purgative."
BUFFY,Prerogative.
DAWN,"Whatever, Joan."
BUFFY,"Whatever, Umad."
DAWN/BUFFY,"(unison) Boy, you're a pain in the/Boy, you're bossy!"
DAWN,Do you think we're-
BUFFY,Sisters?
SPIKE,(to Giles) You never showed me affection like that!
SPIKE,...I'd wager.
BUFFY,"Well, we need to figure out what's going on. We need to get help."
SPIKE,Looks like Joan fancies herself the boss.
BUFFY,We have a kid here-
DAWN,A teenager.
BUFFY,A teenager. And we have no idea what's wrong with us. I think a hospital's our best bet.
GILES,"Uh, yes, let's, um, let's head out."
BUFFY,Any suggestions on how we're gonna get there?
SPIKE,"Dad can drive. He's bound to have some classic midlife-crisis transport. (puts arm around Giles's shoulder) Something red, shiny, shaped like a penis."
BUFFY,Did you guys see that?
SPIKE,Vampires!
TARA,Maybe it's Halloween.
DAWN,It doesn't feel like Halloween.
XANDER,"Even if it is, those guys are definitely not kids, and those are definitely not costumes. Randy's right. Looks like we have vampires."
VAMP,(O.S.) Slayer!
XANDER,They're definitely not knocking for candy.
WILLOW,"Okay, doors, we need to check to see if there's other doors, a-and make sure they're locked and put large objects in front of them. Come on."
BUFFY,Monsters are real. Did we know this?
TARA,"I don't know, but we n-need our memories back. We have to get to a hospital. (Buffy nodding)"
GILES,"As, uh, proprietor of a magic shop, I propose we fight them. (Buffy shaking her head) We can use things here in the shop, you know, magic ... tricks or whatever."
VAMP 2,Send out Spike!
GILES,They seem to want spikes.
SPIKE,Oh!
SPIKE,Let's give 'em these.
GILES,Well done.
DAWN,"But wait, what are they going to do with them?"
VAMP,"(O.S.) Slayer, come out and play!"
TARA,"'Slay her,' that's just what they said before. (horrified) Th-th-they're gonna use the spikes to-"
BUFFY,To slay someone? A female someone! (Giles looking horrified) Who do those jerks think they are?
ANYA,"Bloodsuckers. They kill by sucking blood. Take it easy, Joan."
WILLOW,(O.S.) You guys!
XANDER,"Trap door in the basement, it seems to lead to the sewer."
ANYA,Let's go!
XANDER,"Now I'm not sure what I am so bear with me here. (in background we see one vamp grabbing Buffy, who shrieks) Now I lay me down to sleep, uh, shabat Israel, uh, om, om."
VAMP 3,You owe us!
SPIKE,Fine! Take your damn spikes!
VAMP 3,Don't be stupid.
BUFFY,"Get your hands off me, you son of a-"
VAMP 3,I said you owe us.
SPIKE,"Who, me?"
VAMP 3,You've got the boss's kittens.
SPIKE,Kittens?!
BUFFY,Hey! Stay away from Randy!
DAWN,Whoa!!
WILLOW,What did you just do?
BUFFY,Uh ... I....
BUFFY,I don't know. (slow smile) But it was COOL!
VAMP 1,The boss ain't gonna like this! I'll be back. And I won't be alone!
BUFFY,(to others) I think I know why Joan's the boss. I'm like a superhero or something!
VAMP 1,"The boys want to taste blood, boss. They wanna break down the door."
SHARK DEMON,The boys are barbarians. There's no need to do that. The humans will turn on him soon enough.
SHARK DEMON,"(O.S.) And if they don't, we'll burn the place to the ground."
BUFFY,Okay. I've got a plan.
XANDER,I'm all ears.
BUFFY,"They seem to want Randy. And I seem to be pretty strong. Wicked strong. So, you guys go through the sewers to get to the hospital, and Randy and I'll give the monsters a run for their money."
SPIKE,That's your plan?
BUFFY,Yes.
SPIKE,Right.
ANYA,"I'm not leaving the shop. I have to protect the cash register, and ... do some spells."
GILES,"Oh. Well, magic might help, yes, it's worth a shot."
BUFFY,"All right. You work on that then. We need to go. Ready, Randy?"
SPIKE,"Ready, Joan."
GILES,"Um, son. (Spike stops) Come here. Um, please."
SPIKE,Um...
GILES,"Yes, um..."
SPIKE,Right.
GILES,"Good, then."
BUFFY,Randy!
SPIKE,"(turns to her) Hey, I'm a superhero too!"
SPIKE,"Joan, where're you going?"
SPIKE,(calls) Hey! Joan! Wait up!
XANDER,"Almost there, come on. There we go."
DAWN,Thanks.
DAWN,"(sings) The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah. The ants go marching one by-"
ANYA,This must be nice for us.
GILES,Sorry?
ANYA,I mean ... I know there's...
ANYA,"(OS) ...the vampire problem, and our memory loss, and all that, but still..."
ANYA,...to spend this time together alone? Must be nice.
GILES,"(puts ticket back in his pocket) Uh, yes, yes, um, I'm sure that's right. Um, which, uh, which book shall we start with?"
ANYA,(smiling) This is the book for us.
GILES,"(takes book) Oh, good. Does it focus on mind control, or-or memory loss?"
ANYA,"Not exactly, I just, um ... my intuition tells me this is the book. (Giles stares at her) And I figure being a magic shop owner and a natural at the supernatural, I should trust my intuition."
GILES,"Y-yes, fine, but as you recall, (caressing her face) I too am a magic shop owner."
ANYA,"True, but my intuition says that you're not so much the magic guy and more of a paperwork type. (Giles frowns) Okay, here we go."
GILES,But you don't even know-
ANYA,(reads from book) Bara bara himble gemination.
SPIKE,Wait up!
SPIKE,"Bloody hell, what are you doing?"
BUFFY,"(staring at him, realizing) You don't know who you are."
SPIKE,"Right, none of us do, and we're being chased by-"
BUFFY,You're a vampire!
SPIKE,"(shocked) How can you say - I, me, a vampire? No."
BUFFY,Check the lumpies. And the teeth.
BUFFY,I kill your kind.
SPIKE,And I bite yours. (drops his hand from his face) So how come I don't wanna bite you? (Buffy frowns in confusion) And why am I fightin' other vampires?
SPIKE,I must be a noble vampire. (Buffy looks dubious) A good guy. On a mission of redemption. I help the hopeless. (chuckles) I'm a vampire with a soul.
BUFFY,"(frowning) A vampire with a soul? (beat) Oh my god, how lame is that?"
GILES,Perhaps we should try another book.
ANYA,(O.S.) No!
Reveal Anya standing on a chair holding the book close to her face. We see that there are bunnies everywhere,"on the floor, the counter, the bookshelves."
ANYA,"This book made the little fluffers, and this book's gonna send 'em back. I've got it this time, okay. (reads) 'Himble abri, abri voyon.'"
GILES,"Yes, dear."
SPIKE,"I'm a hero really. I mean, to be cast such an ugly lot in life and then to rise above it. To seek out better, nobler things. It's inspirational, isn't it? And the two of us... (gestures from Buffy to himself) natural enemies, thrown together to stand against the forces of darkness. Utter trust. No thought of me biting you, no thought of you staking me."
BUFFY,Depends on how long you keep on yapping.
TARA,Come on. This way. Up the ladder.
XANDER,(whispers) He's coming!
GILES,"Clearly that is not a helpful book, *darling.*"
GILES,"Come down, and we will go about fixing this in a sensible fashion!"
ANYA,"Sensible! You think it's sensible for me to go down into that pit of cotton-top hell, and let them hippity-hop all over my vulnerable flesh?"
GILES,"Fine, then just stay up there and keep making bunnies! That's a capital plan!"
ANYA,"What capital? I never know what you're talking about. Loo, shag, brolly, what the hell is all that?"
GILES,What? There's no way that you could remember me saying any of those words.
ANYA,"Oh, bugger off, you brolly."
BUFFY: Note to self,learn to duck.
GILES,"(yells) Get a different book! (grunts) Put that book down, do you hear? Not ... that... (ducks a sword thrust) book!"
WILLOW,"How you doin', Dawn?"
DAWN,"Uh, I'm okay. It's scary ... but, weirdly? Kind of familiar."
WILLOW,(frowns) I know what you mean.
DAWN,How are you?
WILLOW,"A little confused. I mean, I'm ... all sweaty ... and trapped, no memory, hiding in a pipe from a vampire..."
