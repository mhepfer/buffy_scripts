<BLOCKQUOTE>GILES VOICEOVER,Previously...
BUFFY,I'm using you.
SPIKE,"Oh, this is worse then, is it? This   is you telling me..."
BUFFY,It's over.
JONATHAN,Where've you guys been?
ANDREW,"Checking out Buffy on   the van's remote surveillance."
BUFFY,I thought you were gonna go see Tara.
WILLOW VOICEOVER,"She's ...   seeing someone else. They're probably just friends."
ANYA,Xander's gone? Xander's missing?
XANDER,Is she here?
WILLOW,"She left a couple days   ago."
BUFFY,She was ... kinda broken.
XANDER,"I love her, and, god, I   miss her so much."
DAWN,No!
ANYA,"How   could you do this?"
DAWN,"Buffy, stop! No!"
BUFFY,"I'm so   sorry."
XANDER,"We're okay, it's all okay."
WARREN,Ha ha!
ANDREW,They're getting to the gate!
WARREN,"I see it,   I see it!"
"The vampires continue fleeing. Now we see one of them has something in his   hand","a flat round metallic disk three or four inches in diameter. The Geeks   continue pursuing."
ANDREW,We're gonna lose 'em.
JONATHAN,We need that disk.
WARREN,Wait.
SPIKE,How you doin'?
BUFFY,"(holding the vamp off) Oh, fine. You know,   same old same old."
SPIKE,"Here, I could take care of this guy if you   want."
BUFFY,Whatever.
BUFFY,Your call.
SPIKE,"I mean, sure he don't look like much..."
"VAMP   2",Hey!
SPIKE,"...but I'd wager he could give you a bit o' nasty. (Buffy   kicking Vamp 1) Save you the staking. (Buffy throwing Vamp 1 to the ground)   All you gotta do is-"
BUFFY,I am not telling my friends about us.
SPIKE,"Right, I'll just be dropping him down to you then."
BUFFY,"(still struggling   with Vamp 1) You wanna tell them so badly? Go ahead."
BUFFY,"You know why? I tried to kill my friends, my sister, last week ...   and guess how much they hate me. Zero. Zero much. (shrugs) So I'm thinking,   sleeping with you? (Spike looking annoyed) They'll deal."
SPIKE,"In that case, why won't you sleep with me again?"
VAMP 2,Huh?
BUFFY,(quietly as she walks away) Because I don't love you.
SPIKE,(to himself) Like hell.
TARA,Hey!
WILLOW,"Hey. Look at you. All coming out of class and   everything. (they continue walking)"
TARA,"(smiling) I do that sometimes.   Usually at the end part of the class."
WILLOW,"Right. (nervous   laugh)"
TARA,"So how's your, you know, after the whole basement deal?   (gesturing at her neck)"
WILLOW,"(puts hand to her neck) It's between a   hitch and a kink, with a side of a twinge. It's okay. (smiling)"
TARA,"And   Buffy's okay too? Enjoying the refreshing sanity and so forth? (stops   walking)"
WILLOW,"(loud fake laugh) Ha, yeah! Refreshing san - that's funny.   (more seriously) She's okay. A little ... freaked. I'm glad she didn't hurt   you."
TARA,You too.
TARA,"So, this is becoming kind of a regular thing, you and me after   class."
WILLOW,"(nervous) Uh, I didn't..."
TARA,"Only this time you stuck   around."
WILLOW,"Uh, um ... various sounds of hesitation..."
TARA,"She was   just a friend."
WILLOW,"(relieved, nervous laugh) Friends are nice!"
TARA,"(smiles) You rushed off before I could, you know, explain."
WILLOW,"Well,   officially, I have to say I have no idea what you're talking about."
TARA,Unofficially?
WILLOW,"We should have some coffee some time. (nervously) Uh, maybe some   day ... this week after class?"
TARA,"(small smile) I'm free   tomorrow."
WILLOW,"Uh, you could, you could bring your friend."
TARA,"(surprised) I wasn't gonna - I-I mean, if you have a friend-"
WILLOW,"No!   (quickly) I'm, oh, I-I'm friendless."
TARA,"Yeah, yeah, no friends.   (quickly) I-I mean, I have friends-"
WILLOW,"Right, many dear friends, yeah."
TARA,"(sighing, smiling) Coffee."
WILLOW,"With us. Who are ... just   friends. (both nodding at each other)"
Cut to,"exterior street mall, day. Lots of people walking around, shopping   etc."
BUFFY,"(OS) Okay, how about this store?"
DAWN,"Ah. Three pairs of earrings, a coin purse and a toothbrush."
BUFFY,(dubious) You stole a toothbrush.
DAWN,"(defensive) A mother-of-pearl   handle. Very fancy."
BUFFY,"Yeah, but you stole a toothbrush. As far as   rebellious teenagers go, you're kinda square."
DAWN,"(smiling) Dental   hygiene is important."
BUFFY,"Guess this was kind of a lame sisters' day   out, huh? I make up for trying to kill you by taking you to places you can't   go in."
DAWN,"No, it's my bad. I'm the one that got caught taking   stuff."
BUFFY,"(noticing something offscreen, pointing) Hey, how about the   pet store? You didn't take anything from there, did you?"
DAWN,"A pocketful   of goldfish. It didn't work out."
DAWN,(laughing) No!
BUFFY,"(smiling) Okay, good. We can go, and we can   look at all the puppies."
DAWN,"(grimacing) Ehh. It's so awful! There's   puppy mills, and keeping them in cages, and, and people poking at them all   day."
BUFFY,"Yeah, but puppies, cute! Come on, you used to love the pet   store."
DAWN,"Yes, when I was in my fives and sixes. (sees Buffy looking   disappointed) Uh, come on, we'll go look. (looking around) Besides, I don't   think there's another store here where I can ... show my face."
BUFFY,"It'll   pass. You've returned all the stuff that you still had, and we're paying for   the rest."
DAWN,I'm paying for the rest.
BUFFY,We'll figure it out.
Cut to,"close-up of the disk from earlier. We see that it has symbols drawn   in concentric rings on its surface. It sits on a table leaning against a small   glass jar filled with yellow liquid."
JONATHAN,(OS) Get back.
JONATHAN,"You don't want to make me rush this. (mixing stuff in the   mortar)"
WARREN,"I'm not impressed, padawan. When do we hit   pay-dirt?"
JONATHAN,"If something goes wrong, it's gonna surge... (Warren   pacing to the other side) ...and we'll be deader than an   ex-girlfriend."
WARREN,"(pauses, whirls to stare at Jonathan) What did you   say?"
JONATHAN,(annoyed) Just let me work!
WARREN,"(playing it cool) All   right. All right, you do what you need to do. You get us to the goods, and   then watch out! (smiles) It'll gonna be like ... it'll be like the whole world   just spread open and gave it up for you, man."
JONATHAN,"(quietly) And then we're done, right? We each take our share and   we call it a day."
WARREN,You that ready to get rid of us? Huh?
WARREN,"Don't worry. We pull this off, you can go buy any tropical island   you want. (Jonathan still looking grim) Aw, cheer up, Short Round. You're   about to get us everything we ever wanted."
WARREN,(quietly) He's almost done. (shot of Jonathan working)
ANDREW,"I   sorta feel ... kinda sorry for him."
WARREN,"(glares at him) That's a   weakness."
ANDREW,(uncertain) Um ... okay.
WARREN,"Look at him. (shot of   Jonathan working, frowning)"
ANDREW,"He's got that same look on his face,   the one he had that time I highlighted in his Babylon 5 novels."
ANDREW,"Right before he told his mother on me! Warren! I don't think we can   trust him."
WARREN,We don't have to. Not for that much longer.
ANDREW,Is it gonna be that soon?
WARREN,"The milk. In the fridge. How long 'til it   expires?"
ANDREW,"Well, we got it on Friday, and I remember noticing there   wasn't a full two weeks on it, (Warren rolling his eyes) but we did get it in   the fridge pretty quick, unless I'm thinking of the two-percent   milk..."
WARREN,"(annoyed) Forget it. It was a thing. (explaining) It's   gonna be soon."
ANDREW,(pretending to get it) Oh. Wow.
XANDER,Oh my god.
XANDER,How are you?
ANYA,Ducky. You?
XANDER,"(holding out a hand   toward her) Ahn. (sighs) Please. Let me, uh, explain."
XANDER,"I know there's nothing that I can say or do to make up for what I   did. I can't. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I'm like, 'oh god, is   this my life? Was that me?'"
ANYA,(softly) Me too.
XANDER,"But you gotta   believe me, please. I want to make up for it. I want to take away the hurt.   (small sigh) I love you so much."
XANDER,"(embarrassed smile) I, I may have practiced that a couple times in   front of the mirror."
ANYA,"I just ... don't understand what   happened."
XANDER,"I do. I'm an idiot. All I had to do was say something   earlier. (Anya looks surprised) I could have spared you from that ... that   nightmare."
ANYA,Said something about what?
XANDER,"(makes ""uh-oh"" face) No, no! I   mean, you know, if I were, like, more ... self-aware. Because, with the whole   idiot thing."
ANYA,"(arms still folded, angrily) If you had been more   self-aware, you would have what? (Xander looking alarmed) Been able to stop   the wedding?"
XANDER,"No no, it's not like that, that's not what... (pauses,   frustrated sigh) Okay, see, I didn't practice this part."
ANYA,"(firmly) Do   you still want to get married?"
ANYA,(very quietly) Oh.
XANDER,"Ahn, it's a very complicated   question."
ANYA,"(getting teary) No, actually, it's really not. It's kind of   an either-or deal. Do you want to get married?"
XANDER,"Someday, yes, very   much. When we're ready. (Anya looking very hurt) I don't want you to take this   as a bad thing. It's good. (Anya looking resigned, annoyed) I love you, I love   you so much, I'm just trying to be honest with you."
ANYA,"(angry) Yes,   honesty *now*. Congratulations, Xander, on being honest now. I wonder what the   medal will say."
XANDER,"(confused) Okay, clearly I'm not handling this   well."
ANYA,"(yelling) Well, duh!"
XANDER,"All I want is for us to be together. I love you, I ... I wish we   could just go back to the way things were before."
ANYA,(demon voice) And I wish you were never born!
XANDER,I know this is all coming out wrong.
ANYA,"(angry) I wish you felt the pain of a thousand searing pokers boiling   your heart in its own juices!"
XANDER,"I know, honey. I totally deserve   that."
ANYA,"(confused) I ... I wish you had tentacles where your beady eyes   should be! I wish your intestines were tied in knots and ripped apart inside   your lousy gut!"
XANDER,(sadly) They are.
ANYA,"(hopeful) Really?   (Xander nods) Right now? Does it hurt?"
XANDER,"God, yes. It hurts so bad   it's killing me. Anya ... I love you, I want to make this work."
ANYA,"(annoyed) Those are metaphor intestines! You're not in any real pain! What's   wrong with me?"
XANDER,"No, honey, it's not you, it's me. That-"
ANYA,(frustrated) Ohh!!
XANDER,Ahn! Ahn! Wait. Please.
XANDER,Ahn!
HALFREK VOICEOVER,"So there was no child support in, like, eleven years..."
Cut to,"a restaurant, day. Halfrek and Anya sit at a table. Halfrek holds a   coffee cup. Anya is fiddling with a yellow flower, not really listening to   Halfrek."
HALFREK,"...not a single check, so now, every time he picks up a piece of   paper that isn't a check for the child? Paper cut."
HALFREK,"Oh, you know how I hate to toot my own horn ... but now his hands   are just covered in all these tiny little bandages. (smiling) Like a quilt.   (chuckles) You know, made of bandages."
ANYA,Hmm?
HALFREK,"Okay, do they not teach listening skills in Human   World? (puts down coffee cup)"
ANYA,"I'm sorry. I know. (puts the flower   back into its vase on the table) I'm just distracted."
HALFREK,"What, about   this thing with Xander? Don't worry, you'll figure out a way to-"
ANYA,"No,   that's just it, I've tried everything. I tried every curse I knew, nothing's   worked."
HALFREK,Wait. Did you try to curse him yourself?
ANYA,"Yeah, I   am the wronged party here, of course I-"
HALFREK,"You can't exact justice   against someone on behalf of yourself, silly! (laughs) How long have you been   away?"
ANYA,"I haven't been scorned by a man in, like, a thousand years. I   never had to make a wish for myself. There has to be some way around   that."
HALFREK,"Well ... (thinks) You could try getting someone to make the   wish for you. I suppose."
Cut to,"exterior Summers house, day."
DAWN,Uh ... did we open a chain?
DAWN,Are we the International House of something?
BUFFY,"Nope. Got up   early, and it felt like a breakfast kind of morning. (puts pancakes from the   pan onto a plate) Okay, what kind of syrup do you want on your   pancakes?"
DAWN,(amazed) Syrups have kinds?
BUFFY,"Oh! Also, you know, I   was thinking, (turns away to put the pan in the sink) after the mall   yesterday, maybe we, we shouldn't go out tonight, you know, maybe we could   stay in and, uh, (taking toast from the toaster) ow ... um, you know, get a   pizza, or, uh, rent a movie?"
DAWN,Um...
BUFFY,"(putting plateful of   toast on the island) Also, I didn't know if, you know, if you had plans this   weekend, (turns to grab the cereal boxes) but I thought, maybe we   could..."
DAWN,"Hey, Buffy?"
DAWN,"(quietly) I'm gonna be okay with the basement thing. Really. You   weren't you."
BUFFY,"(quietly) This isn't guilt. I want us to spend   time."
DAWN,Okay. Good. I love spending time-
BUFFY,"(realizing) But I'm   cramping your teenage style."
DAWN,No-
BUFFY,"Yes, I am. (alarmed) I'm   the embarrassing mom who tries too hard. When did this happen?"
DAWN,"(smiling) No, you're not, it's not that, it's just ... what if, instead of you   hanging out with me? Maybe I could hang out with you."
DAWN,Why don't I come patrolling with you tonight?
BUFFY,"Oh. And then?   Maybe we can invite over some strangers and ask them to feed you   candy."
DAWN,"Well, you guys went out patrolling every night when you were   my age."
BUFFY,"True ... but technically, you're one-and-a-half."
BUFFY,"See, I thought a little levity might ... but okay, also no."
DAWN,I just ... I just think I could help.
BUFFY,"I'm sure you could. But it's a   little more dangerous than I had in mind."
DAWN,But-
BUFFY,"Dawn, I work   very hard to keep you away from that stuff. Okay, I don't want you around   dangerous things that can kill you."
DAWN,"Which would be a perfectly   reasonable argument, if my sister was chosen to protect the world from tax   audits? But, see, my sister is you, and ... dangerous things that want to kill   me seem to find me."
BUFFY,But you don't need to go looking for them.
BUFFY,Now eat up. You're gonna be late for school.
Cut to,"the Espresso Pump, day."
TARA,"(OS) Okay, wait, it was under her wig?"
WILLOW,"Well, it was this thing, it just came out from inside her   head."
TARA,That's disgusting! What did it look like?
WILLOW,"Well,   let's put it this way, if I wasn't gay before..."
TARA,"(laughing) God, and   this was *after* the invisible ray?"
WILLOW,Yep.
TARA,"Okay, I'm gone   for a couple of months-"
WILLOW,"Oh, did I tell you about the demon   eggs?"
TARA,"See, now, now I know you're just trying to make me   jealous."
WILLOW,"(grinning) So, what, no rollicking adventures in the   dorms?"
TARA,"(quieter) Mm, it's not the same. It's not like living with a   house full of family, or sharing a room with someone you..."
WILLOW,"...are   friends with?"
ANYA,Hi.
WILLOW,Oh my god. You're back. (hugs Anya)
TARA,"We've   been so worried."
ANYA,"Yeah, sorry. I needed to, you know ... I couldn't   stay here. Not after ... everything that happened."
TARA,"No, no no, we, we   totally understand."
WILLOW,"But, you're back now, right?"
ANYA,"It's   complicated. (sits) You know, and there's a lot to deal with."
WILLOW,"Well,   if there's anything we can do, just let us-"
ANYA,"Actually ... um ... there   is an eensy something I could use a little help with. You're lesbians, so the   hating of men will come in handy."
ANYA,(cheerfully) Let's talk about Xander.
Cut to,"Magic shop, day. Close on Dawn."
DAWN,He feels awful.
ANYA,You think it's anywhere close to what I feel?
DAWN,"No,   but-"
ANYA,"What if it were you, Dawn? What if ... all you dreamed about was   that magical day? (Dawn looking chastised) The day when the one person you   loved with all your soul would promise to cherish and protect your heart for   the rest of his life, but instead he shatters it into a million jagged pieces?"
TARA,"Well, it's, it's not really so much   about hating the men."
WILLOW,"We're more centered around the ... (smirking)   girl on girl action. (Tara grinning)"
ANYA,"And men really like to watch   that kind of stuff, don't they? Men like Xander."
Cut to,"exterior Summers house, day. Anya and Buffy stand on the front   porch, leaning against the two pillars on either side of the door, facing each   other."
BUFFY,I don't think he could feel any worse.
ANYA,"Let's test   that theory."
BUFFY,"Anya, Xander's my friend. I know what he did was wrong,   and ... if it had happened to me, I'd-"
ANYA,"(hopefully) Wish his penis   would explode?"
DAWN,"I never use that word   anymore."
ANYA,Coagulate?
DAWN,W-i-s-h.
ANYA,"Oh, wish! As in 'I   wish Xander-'"
DAWN,"Right! That word. There's vengeance demons out there   that are still active, remember? Any 'I wish' could totally end in horrible   grossness."
ANYA,Gimme a for-instance?
BUFFY,I don't really think I should.
ANYA,"Did I mention the whole 'left at the altar' thing? Didn't leave that out, did   I?"
BUFFY,"No. (shakes head) Look, I - I know what he did was wrong. God, if   it happened to me, I ... I-I, it must have been torture."
ANYA,"(excited)   Okay! Let's talk about torture!"
ANYA,"So. Tell me more   about wishing Xander's brains and guts would go blooey."
DAWN,"I didn't say   that."
ANYA,Yes you did.
DAWN,No I didn't.
ANYA,"I heard   you."
DAWN,"I swear, I didn't say that."
ANYA,Didn't say what?
DAWN,"Um ... I just saw you were back and wanted to talk to you about working off my   debt. (nervous chuckle) You know, my whole sticky-fingers, grabby-hands   thing?"
ANYA,"Oh, right, the mad thieving! Good, yes, there 's much to do.   (mock stern) I'm gonna put you to work, missy!"
ANYA,"So, back to Xander's brains and guts..."
ANYA,"Squish squish squish! Guys have been running roughshod over you   for years. (Buffy nodding, pouting, reluctantly agreeing) Torturing that perky   little ticker. Aren't you sick of it? Don't you wish guys like that-"
BUFFY,"Whoa. Guys? There have only been four - three! Three! Three guys. That's   barely plural."
ANYA,"And didn't each of them rip your heart out? Don't men   like that, as to pick an example, Xander, deserve to be punished?"
WILLOW,"Well, Xander is a guy, so ... (Tara   looking confused) it's kinda not the surprise that he likes to watch ... girls   ... Why are we talking about this?"
ANYA,"(annoyed) We're comforting   me!"
TARA,"Well, I-I guess it's ... natural for guys to be interested   in-"
ANYA,"God! What kind of lesbians are you?! If you love men so much, go   love men!"
BUFFY,"Anya, I know you're hurting, but-"
ANYA,"What? Xander doesn't   deserve to suffer for what he did 'cause he's your friend, and I'm not, right?   I get it."
BUFFY,"No. That's not what I'm saying at all. What he did was   wrong. He knows that."
ANYA,"(upset) It just, it hurts. He hurt me so   much."
BUFFY,"(gets up) He really did. (puts hand on Anya's arm) Look, I-I   wish that..."
XANDER,(OS) Anya?
ANYA,"(angry) Well, congratulations. They all still love you. Even after   what you did to me."
XANDER,"Anya, wait..."
BUFFY,"Okay. Not, not crazy about that   idea."
XANDER,What are you doing? I have to go after her.
BUFFY,"Or, in   the land of the sane, you could give her some space, let her cool   down."
XANDER,"(frustrated) That's not Proactive Guy. (pacing) That's   Sit-Around-And ... Watch-The-Rest-of-Your-Life-To-Turn-To-Crap Guy."
BUFFY,"True, uh, but at least Crap Guy gets to keep all of his   appendages."
XANDER,"And I'm supposed to what? Walk away? (Buffy looking   sympathetic) Shouldn't be too hard. It's what I'm good at, right?"
BUFFY,"Okay, see, that's exactly why a heart-to-heart is probably not your   best course of action right now. (Xander still pacing) When you're both angry   and upset and ... what the hell is that creepy little thing doing in my yard?"
BUFFY,"Did Willow put that there when I was dead? 'Cause if I had known, I   would have crawled out of the grave sooner to-"
XANDER,Buffy.
BUFFY,Oh my god.
XANDER,"Looks like someone's been keeping an eye on   all your ins and outs."
BUFFY,What the who?
XANDER,"Well, now, let's   see. Who's obsessed with Buffy? Who likes to hang out in her yard and keep an   eye on her? Who's in love with you and not getting any?"
Cut to,close-up of a hand holding the camera.
SPIKE,What's this?
BUFFY,It's a camera.
SPIKE,"Yeah, I got that part. Why am I holding   it?"
BUFFY,"Someone was using it to spy on me. On my house. (Spike frowning)   Xander thinks it's you."
SPIKE,"Oh, the great Xander thinks so! Shudder   gasp! It must be true!"
BUFFY,Spike-
SPIKE,"That ponce has always had it   for me. Every chance he gets, he sticks it-"
SPIKE,"(outraged) You believe him, don't you? You think I was spying on   you."
SPIKE,You think I could do that?
BUFFY,"Because you don't lie or cheat   or steal or manipulate..."
SPIKE,(quietly) I don't hurt you.
BUFFY,I know.
SPIKE,"No, you don't. I've tried to make it clear to you,   but you won't see it. (pauses) Something happened to me. The way I feel ...   about you ... it's different. And no matter how hard you try to convince   yourself it isn't, it's real."
BUFFY,I think it is.
BUFFY,For you.
BUFFY,"I know that's not what you want to hear. I'm sorry. I really am.   But, Spike, you have to move on. You have to get over-"
SPIKE,"(softly) Get   out."
Cut to,"magic shop. Anya stands behind the counter talking to Halfrek, who   is on the other side of the counter sitting on a stool."
ANYA,"No! They're all, 'oh, poor Xander! It took so much out of him, all   that running away he did.' I just don't understand what's wrong with these   people."
HALFREK,"Did you really think they were the ones who would help   you?"
ANYA,"Well, but-"
HALFREK,"Do you want retribution,   Anyanka?"
ANYA,I want Xander good and cursed.
HALFREK,"Then you know   what you have to do."
ANYA,"Get a wish from someone who doesn't freaking   love him."
HALFREK,Exactly.
ANYA,"Yeah, but my social circle is a little   limited here. What am I supposed to do, just stumble upon someone who doesn't   give a fig's ass if Xander gets hurt?"
SPIKE,Hey. I need a thing.
ANYA,So. What's your pleasure?
SPIKE,"Fresh of out of pleasure. That's   why I'm here. (sighs) I need something. Numbing spell, maybe."
ANYA,"(fake   smile) Uh huh. Hang on."
ANYA,"(quietly, smiling) Oh my God. Spike *hates* Xander. Maybe I could get   him to wish ... dammit, if only he were a woman. (thinks) Got it! If I can   somehow get someone to wish that Spike were a woman, then I could go to him -   well, he'd be a her by then - then I could go to her -"
HALFREK,"Anyanka.   There's an easier way. Now, I know you have this whole female-power, Take Back   the Night thing, I think that's cute. But I've been telling you for decades -   men need a little vengeance now and then, too."
ANYA,"Oh. (looks over at   Spike)"
HALFREK,Maybe this is a good chance to try it out.
HALFREK,Good luck with that. Ta-ta!
SPIKE,Sorry to bust up the little girls' night out.
ANYA,"(walking   toward him) That's okay. I'm ready to do some business."
SPIKE,"Right then.   Got something that'll dull the ache a bit?"
ANYA,"(smiling) Actually, yes.   (walks back behind the counter) Um, Giles left a couple of supplies here, and   I think ... this might help."
ANYA,"Eases the hurt ... makes the sun shine a little brighter, (Spike   frowning) even makes boring people seem more interesting. Ah. Here."
Cut to,"close shot on a table strewn with various colored wires. The camera   from the garden gnome sits there with several wires attached. A hand attaches   another wire to it. We see a laptop computer next to the camera."
BUFFY,How's it coming? Can you see who's getting the camera's signal?
WILLOW,"Should have something once I get tapped into the fiber-optic   network. We're gonna use the feedback relay to, uh, get their signal routed   into our system."
XANDER,"Okay, if it's not Spike, and I'm, I'm not saying I   believe him ... but if it's not Spike, I think we already know who's behind   this."
WILLOW,(typing) Makes sense.
BUFFY,"(grimly) I want. To find.   These guys."
Cut to,"the Geek Trio Lair. Green, blue, yellow liquids bubble in the   chemistry set. Jonathan lights a red candle on the table next to the chemistry   stuff. Warren and Andrew stand watching."
JONATHAN,Uncover.
JONATHAN,There. That's it. That's where we have to go.
WARREN,"Well,   now that we've found out where we're supposed to go-"
JONATHAN,Yah!
Cut to,"magic shop, night. Spike is sitting on the stool beside the   counter, Anya still standing behind the counter. They both have shot glasses   and are in the process of drinking the shots."
SPIKE,"(angrily) So then, this girl says, ""real for *you*."""
ANYA,"Right.   But getting back to Xander..."
SPIKE,"(scornful) Xander. Let's not waste any   more breath on that wanker."
ANYA,"But he made a fool of me. And nobody   seems to care enough to do anything!"
SPIKE,"I care. What he done to you?   I've never stooped that low, and I'm an 'evil, soulless thing.' (bitterly)   According to some people."
ANYA,"But shouldn't he pay? Don't you wish he had   to pay in some horrible way?"
SPIKE,Absolutely.
SPIKE,"Take him on myself, if it wasn't for my little handicap. (gesturing   at his head)"
ANYA,"Right. (sits) So ... hypothetically, what do you wish you could do to   him? (Spike pouring fresh shots for both of them)"
SPIKE,"You name it, pet.   You're the wronged party. Something, uh... (lifts his glass) gruesome, how   'bout?"
Cut to,"Geek Trio lair. Andrew and Warren are stomping on the fire trying   to put it out. Jonathan runs in with a fire extinguisher."
JONATHAN,Hey! That's my blanket!
WARREN,"Well, makes sense, it was your   fire."
Cut to,Summers dining room. Willow still working on her laptop.
WILLOW,"Hey hey, I think I've got something."
ANYA,"(angrily) Thing about it is, none of this was my idea. (disgusted) I   didn't ask to be human. (pouring)"
SPIKE,"Right! And I didn't ask for this   bloody chip in my head."
ANYA,"To tell you the truth ...(puts bottle down)   all I wanted was to use him and lose him. I hadn't had a good tumble in a   thousand years..."
SPIKE,"(grinning) Me too. The using part. I just wanted   to know what I was missing, move on."
ANYA,"(maudlin) Yeah ... and he was   ... all bumpy ... in the right places. And nice to me..."
SPIKE,(softly) She was so raw. I've never felt anything like it.
ANYA,"Next thing you know ... I'm changing to please him. (a little more upset) I   care if he cares!"
SPIKE,(nodding) Right.
ANYA,"And I'm off my guard.   Happy! I'm singing in the shower and doing my sexy dance?!"
SPIKE,"Exactly.   (pauses) I ... have no dance."
BUFFY,"Talk to me,   Will."
WILLOW,"Technology's pretty sophisticated, lots of booby traps and   firewall stuff... (shot of the screen showing a ""radar"" diagram of concentric   circles)"
BUFFY,But can you get us a location?
WILLOW,"Well, hey, I'm   still me. Just one - whoa."
BUFFY,What?
WILLOW,There are other cameras.
ANYA,Screw 'em!
SPIKE,To the rafters!
ANYA,I did everything for that man. Was it ever enough?
SPIKE,"Never!   (slurred) I was always going above and beyond. I saved the Scoobies how many   times? And I can't stand the lot of you."
ANYA,"Me either! I hate us!   Everybody's so *nice.* Nobody says what's on their mind."
SPIKE,"You do.   That's why you're the only one of them I wouldn't bite if I had the   chance."
ANYA,"(giggles, pleased) Really?"
SPIKE,"Absolutely. I have   nothing but respect for a woman who is forthright. Drusilla was always   straightforward. Didn't have a single buggering clue about what was going on   in front of her, (Anya giggling) but she was straight about it. That's a   virtue."
ANYA,Mm. Xander didn't think so. He thought I was rude.
SPIKE,"(like 'duh') That's because he's one of them. Uptight. Repressed. (makes   ""uptight"" gesture with one finger)"
ANYA,(frowning) You think?
SPIKE,"Please. It's no wonder they couldn't deal with the likes of you and me, luv.   We should have been dead hundreds of years ago ... and we're the only ones who   are really alive."
WILLOW,"Oh my god, the Double Meat Palace? (image changes) The Bronze? My   classes on campus..."
WILLOW,(OS) Xander's site... (Xander looking surprised)
BUFFY,What?!
XANDER,They've been spying on all these places?
WILLOW,"I can   tell there are more feeds, I, I'm just having a harder time pinpointing 'em.   Here, lemme... (typing)"
SPIKE,"Here. (picks up glass, holds it toward her) Ladies last."
ANYA,(gazing sentimentally at him) Thank you.
SPIKE,"Take it quick or my   chivalry'll run out."
ANYA,No ... (puts her hand on Spike's) thank you.
ANYA,"This is the first time since ... (shrugs) It feels good to be with   someone who understands."
SPIKE,(softly) Intimately. (sighs)
ANYA,"This   whole time, I've been coming on all ... hell-bent and mad. Wanting his head,   you know?"
SPIKE,Yeah.
ANYA,"When, really, I ... (tearfully) can't sleep   at night, thinking it ... has to be my fault, somehow..."
SPIKE,"(shakes his   head) Shh..."
ANYA,"(crying) What if it was just pretending? What if he   never wanted me ... the way I wanted him?"
ANYA,Ohh. I'm sorry.
SPIKE,Now now.
SPIKE,"He would have to be more than just the git he is, Anya. He'd have to   be deaf, dumb and blind not to want a woman like you."
ANYA,"(whispers) Then   why?"
SPIKE,"(looks away, sadly) The two of them ... they're weak, is all.   (pauses) But, I'll tell you what, though. (continues stroking Anya's face)   They'll, uh, miss the water now that the well's gone dry."
ANYA,(quietly) Too hot to handle.
SPIKE,Too hot...
ANYA,Um ... just-just one more question.
SPIKE,Hmm?
ANYA,"(very   softly) Can I see your sexy dance?"
SPIKE,"(small grin) I'll show you   mine..."
ANYA,Wait. Wait. (very soft whisper) What are we doing?
SPIKE,"Moving   on."
WILLOW,"Here, I think there are a couple more   transmitters on the network, I just ... ucch, I've almost got a picture on   'em."
ANYA,"You know I'm only doing this 'cause I'm ... I'm lonely and   drunk and you ... smell really good."
SPIKE,See? Forthright.
Cut to,"Geek Lair. The red light continues flashing, now accompanied by a   loud alarm noise. The geeks look over in alarm."
WARREN,Ahh!
ANDREW,"It tapped into our feed, something's wrong!"
WILLOW,I think I've got the Magic Box.
WILLOW,Whoa!
WARREN,"(OS) Shut it down, shut it *all*   down!"
ANDREW,"I'm trying, I can't find --"
JONATHAN,"(reaching across Warren to   Andrew's keyboard) Here, dorkface-"
ANDREW,I'll get it myself-
WARREN,"Guys, we have to - oh, holy crap."
JONATHAN,Oh my god.
WARREN,"What is that, p-porn?"
JONATHAN,Oh my god.
WARREN,"Is that the cam in the Magic   Box?"
JONATHAN,Oh my god.
ANDREW,What are they ... ohh.
WARREN,"Is   that-"
JONATHAN,Spike.
ANDREW,"(riveted) He is so cool. (glances at the   others, self-consciously) And, I mean, the girl is hot too."
WARREN,(shaking his head) Dude.
WILLOW,"Wait, Xander, no."
XANDER,"(looks) Oh, god."
DAWN,Hey guys. What's up?
WILLOW,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
XANDER,I ... what is she...
WILLOW,Buffy?
BUFFY,That's enough.
WILLOW,"(sits) Here, lemme just... (typing)"
WILLOW,"You know, we, we aren't even really sure what we're just seeing   here, there could be something-"
WILLOW,"There, got it."
WILLOW,Xander?
DAWN,"So. This is it? This is the stuff you've been protecting me from? You   and Spike?"
BUFFY,And a lot of monsters.
DAWN,Uh-huh.
BUFFY,"But   it's over. (Dawn sitting in the other chair) Spike."
DAWN,"I wish you'd told   me."
BUFFY,I kinda didn't wanna admit it to myself.
DAWN,I get that.
DAWN,"I know it must hurt. To feel like you have to hide, to keep secrets   from everybody?"
WILLOW,Buffy. Xander's gone. He took your axe.
XANDER,Get up. Get up!
XANDER,You're just gonna sit there? Do nothing?
XANDER,That the kinda man you are?
SPIKE,"I'm not gonna fight you.   Chip."
XANDER,Too bad.
ANYA,"Xander, no! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!"
ANYA,"Xander, I..."
XANDER,"(panting) Don't even try to deny it. 'Cause I   saw it all. The whole beautiful show."
ANYA,How...?
ANYA,"It was just, it ... it was just a thing. I ... I felt bad, and he was   just ... there."
BUFFY,"(to Spike) Didn't take long, did it? (Spike looking   sourly at her)"
XANDER,"(still yelling at Anya) Oh, oh, oh, okay! You had to   do it. Because he was there. Like Mt. Everest. (upset) Like I used to   be."
ANYA,"(angry) And then you weren't. You left *me,* Xander. At the   altar. (yelling) I don't owe you anything."
XANDER,"So you go out and bang   the first body you can find? Dead or alive?"
ANYA,"Where do you get off   judging me?!"
XANDER,"When this is your solution to our problems. I hurt   you, and you hit me back? Very mature."
ANYA,"No, the mature solution is for   you to spend your whole life telling stupid, pointless jokes, so that no one   will notice that you are just a scared, insecure little boy!"
XANDER,"(bitterly) I'm not joking now. You let that evil, soulless thing touch you.   (pointing at Spike) You wanted me to feel something? (Anya looking chagrined)   Congratulations, it worked."
XANDER,"I look at you ... and I feel sick. 'Cause you had sex with that.   (points at Spike again)"
SPIKE,(quietly) It's good enough for Buffy.
XANDER,"(yells) Shut up and   leave her out of..."
ANYA,Buffy?
BUFFY,Xander...
XANDER,"(shaking his head, full of   pain) I don't want to know this."
XANDER,I don't want to know any of this.
SPIKE,"(OS) Bloody Xander, mucking(?) up everything."
SPIKE,"You know, I wish-"
ANYA,Don't.
TARA,(OS) Things fall apart. They fall apart so hard.
WILLOW,Tara?
TARA,"You can't ever ... (sighs) put them back the way they   were."
WILLOW,Are you okay?
TARA,"I'm sorry, it's just ... (deep sigh)   You know, it takes time. (walking into the room) You can't just ... have   coffee and expect-"
WILLOW,(guilty) I know.
TARA,"There's just so much to work through. Trust has to be built again, on   both sides ... (Willow looking upset) You have to learn if ... if we're even   the same people we were, if you can fit in each other's lives."
TARA,"It's a long... important process, and ... can we just skip it?   Can-can you just be kissing me now?"
