<BLOCKQUOTE>GILES VOICEOVER,Previously...
RILEY,"They want me back, Buffy. The military."
BUFFY,This is   good-bye?
RILEY,"Unless you give me a reason to stay, I'm leaving   tonight."
BUFFY,Riley!
SPIKE,Are we having a conversation?
BUFFY,What? No! ...Maybe.
XANDER,We're getting married.
BUFFY,Congratulations.
BUFFY,Double meat is double sweet. Enjoy.
DAWN,Hey   Buffy!
ANYA,We're here to support your subsistence-level employment.   Bravo.
TODD VOICEOVER,"You see, Buffy..."
TODD VOICEOVER,"...the thing you gotta learn about the Palace, and this   takes a while..."
TODD,...is that job security all boils down to one simple thing.
TODD,Politics.
TODD,"Now, I'm not a political animal, but you learn fast around here or   it's wham! Hello glass ceiling."
TODD,"I mean, it's not like we work at Burger World, or the Happy Bun,   where the power structure is simple. No, here at the Palace, you gotta keep   your friends close, but your enemies? Closer. (Buffy nodding, rolling her   eyes) It's like Machiavelli says. (Buffy looks confused) You know Machiavelli,   right?"
BUFFY,"Tall guy, bleached mullet, works day shifts?"
TODD,(laughs) I'm sorry. My bad. I keep forgetting you dropped out of   college.
BUFFY,I'm reapplying.
TODD,"(patronizing) Good luck with that.   Well, gotta motor! (picks up a backpack) Don't wanna be late for night   school."
BUFFY,You go to night school?
TODD,"I'm working on my MBA.   Think I wanna spend the rest of my life cleaning grease traps? (shakes head)   Ooh, don't forget to lock up before you go, and the gum under the tables? Be   sure to give it a good scrape before you leave."
BUFFY,(sarcastic) May   I?
TODD,(leaving) See you tomorrow!
BUFFY,"(to herself) Yes, you will.   And the day after that, (sighs) and the day after that, and the day after   that..."
BUFFY,"(sings) 'Get the double treat, that's the double sweet, oh it's hard   to beat, when the meat meets-' Oh, why can't I get this stupid jingle out of   my head?"
VAMP,"Least of your problems now, little girl."
BUFFY,Wait.
VAMP,Ooookay.
BUFFY,"(turns back) Okay, let's do this. (points at him)   Quickly."
VAMP,"What's that smell? (sniffing) Geez, Slayer, is that you?"
BUFFY,I've been working!
VAMP,"Where, in a slaughterhouse?!"
BUFFY,(pouts)   Double Meat Palace.
VAMP,Ohhh.
VAMP,"You know what? Let's just call it a night. (Buffy looking surprised)   If it's all the same to you, and you've been eating that stuff, I'm not so   sure I wanna bite you."
BUFFY,You're dead! You smell like it! (vamp   shrugging and nodding) How do you get to say I'm the one who's stinky?   (pouting)
VAMP,"Really, it's, it's cool, I'll just catch you next time."
BUFFY,"Oh, for pete's sake. Spike?"
SPIKE,"Ah, it's a fair cop, you caught me, Slayer. However, in all honesty,   I think we have to say this one doesn't count. After all, I wasn't exactly   hiding. (walks toward her)"
BUFFY,"No, Spike."
SPIKE,"No? What kind of   answer is that, you haven't even heard the question yet."
BUFFY,I don't   have to. We both know what you're thinking.
SPIKE,(grins) And we both know   ... that I'm not the only one thinking it.
BUFFY,No! Not here.
SPIKE,Why not? (pouting)
BUFFY,"Dawn. (looks   toward the house) She's inside waiting for dinner, she's counting on me. I'm   not letting her down by letting you in."
SPIKE,"So it's the fear of getting   caught, then, is it?"
BUFFY,Reason number one on a very long list. (turns   to go)
SPIKE,Needn't be an obstacle.
BUFFY,"(sighs) Spike, I mean it. Come on."
SPIKE,I hear you're serious.   So am I. I want you ... you want me...
SPIKE,"...I can't go inside, so ... maybe the time is right ... for you to   come outside."
BUFFY,Dawn.
BUFFY,"Hey, hi."
DAWN,Rough night?
BUFFY,The usual. I-I brought you   dinner.
DAWN,"Oh, great. (opening bag) Oh."
BUFFY,"I-I know it's not the most original these days, but ... I made it   myself. I-I made hundreds, actually, but this is the, the very best   one."
DAWN,It ... looks kinda squished.
BUFFY,"Oh, well just, you know,   just... (takes the sandwich and slaps it lightly a few times) give it a sec.   (Dawn looking disgusted) Yeah, these babies really bounce back. Literally."
DAWN,"Buffy ... it's not like I don't appreciate it, I do. It's just that   ... (softly) I can't eat this stuff another night. I'm sorry."
BUFFY,"(fake   cheer) Oh! No, it, it's all good. I get it. (taking the sandwich back) Tell   you what, tomorrow night, I'll, uh, I'll bring home the fisherman's nuggets   with cheese."
WILLOW,"Hey, workin' lady. Rough night?"
BUFFY,Why does everybody keep   asking me that?
WILLOW,"Uh, no reason, I just ... thought you were busy   with the slayage 'cause of that grass stain. (pointing to Buffy's jacket)"
DAWN,Some vamp get rough with you?
BUFFY,"(examining coat, muttering)   He's not getting any gentler."
WILLOW,He?
BUFFY,"(quickly) They. Them.   You know. (Willow and Dawn looking at her) Vampires in the, in the ... general   population sense. (looks at jacket, sighs) Now I'm gonna have to wash   this."
WILLOW,"(smiling) Ready for a bold suggestion? (smiling at Dawn, then   at Buffy) Blow it off! Dawnie and I are headed out to the Bronze."
DAWN,"Um,   do I have your permission and wanna come along? (grinning) You like how I   slipped in that permission request like that?"
WILLOW,Very   smooth.
BUFFY,You guys go.
DAWN,Really?
WILLOW,"Buffy, are you   sure? I-it might do you good to get away from the Double Meat lifestyle for a   night. See your friends."
DAWN,Who'd love to see you.
BUFFY,I'm sure.   I've seen enough action for one night. (to Dawn) Home by eleven?
DAWN,(smiles) On the dot.
BUFFY,Have a good time.
BUFFY,(to herself) Somebody should.
ANYA,See ... this seating chart makes no sense. We have to do it again.   (Xander nodding) We can't do it again. You do it.
XANDER,The seating   chart's fine. Let's get back to the table arrangements. I'm starting to have   dreams of gardenia bouquets. (winces) I am so glad my manly coworkers didn't   just hear me say that. (eating chips)
ANYA,Will you stop wolfing down   those chips? One more bag and you'll pop right out of your cummerbund.
ANYA,"You're not even hungry, you're just nervous."
XANDER,"(smacking the   bar-top) Yeah! Wedding, one week! We have friends, family, demons flying in, a   to-do list getting no shorter, and do NOT- (grabs the bag back) -take my   chips."
DAWN,Hey guys! How's the soon-to-be-newlyweds? Nervous?
ANYA/XANDER,No!
DAWN,(dubious) Okay. I'll just be over here then.
DAWN,"Your Arnold Palmer, milady. (gives Willow a drink)"
WILLOW,Thanks.   So how are Mr. and Mrs. High-Strung?
DAWN,I'm betting they   explode.
WILLOW,"You know, when I was little, I used to spend hours   imagining what my wedding to Xander would be like. And now I look at them...   (shot of Anya and Xander at the bar) I just think... (mocking laugh)   ""Nee-hee-hee!"""
DAWN,(giggles) You're awfully chipper tonight.
WILLOW,(smiling) Can't hide it.
DAWN,Hmm. Big wedding coming up ... lots of date   possibilities ... you and Tara are speaking again. You wanna call her? Invite   her over?
WILLOW,"Oh, no. Too soon for so bold a maneuver. (smiles) But if   I did call? She wouldn't hang up on me."
DAWN,That's progress!
WILLOW,(smiling) Hence the happy.
Cut to,"Buffy's basement. An old boom-box is playing a sad country song.   Buffy is wearing an old t-shirt and has her coat on the ironing board, rubbing   it with a rag. She pauses, looks at the grass stain, resumes rubbing."
BUFFY,Garbage! Uhh...
BUFFY,"(OS) Wait! Wait up, guys!"
BUFFY,Wait!
BUFFY,(whining) Don't you want your garbage?
DAWN,"Hey Buffy. Oh, don't forget, today's trash day."
BUFFY,(sourly)   Thanks.
BUFFY,"(OS) 'Dear Ms. Summers, we are sorry to reject...'"
DAWN,What's   that?
BUFFY,(folding the letter) Nothing.
DAWN,Huh. Bronze was fun   last night. In a total home-by-eleven-ish way. You should have come.
BUFFY,"Well, next time. (looks at Dawn) Where are you going?"
DAWN,School?
BUFFY,"(duh) Oh. That's good. Uh, don't you want breakfast   first?"
DAWN,"Already made it. See you this afternoon? Unless you're   working. (coming around the island toward Buffy) Tonight then. Or, you know,   tomorrow's cool. Don't work too hard."
BUFFY,Bye.
Cut to,close shot of the Double Meat grill with nine burgers cooking. A   spatula flipping them over.
TODD,(OS) And that's where even your best political minds can drop the   ball.
TODD,"Zeitgeist! You're not taking the pulse of the public, the next thing   you know you're LBJ handing the house keys over to Nixon. (turns to his work)   Heard back from your college yet?"
BUFFY,Yeah.
TODD,"All right. You   know, we're out of special sauce."
BUFFY,I'll get it.
TODD,No no. Your   turn up front. I'll deal back here. You take the customers.
BUFFY,"Welcome to the Double Meat Palace, how may I help..."
BUFFY,You.
RILEY,Hey.
BUFFY,Huh?
BUFFY,Riley.
RILEY,"Sorry to just drop in on you like this,   Buffy."
BUFFY,It's you.
RILEY,It's me.
BUFFY,You're here.
RILEY,I know.
BUFFY,And ... were you always this tall?
RILEY,"(leans closer)   Look, this isn't the way I wanted it. But something's come up, something big.   We don't have much time. You understand?"
BUFFY,(nodding) Not a work you've   said so far.
RILEY,"Right. I should have known, anticipated. You're   working."
BUFFY,"Well, just counter, not grill any more."
RILEY,"I want to explain,   I just don't have time. I've been up for 48 hours straight tracking something   bad, and now it's come to Sunnydale."
BUFFY,My hat has a cow.
RILEY,"(sighs) I know that I'm putting you on the spot, showing up like this, but ...   but you know, here we are. I need the best. I need you, Buffy. (Buffy staring   at him) Can you help me?"
TODD,"Hellooo, Buffy? People are waiting."
TODD,"Buffy, uh ... Buffy! Wait! Buffy!"
RILEY,"Look, I'm sorry this is all so sudden. You know, if we get a minute,   I'd really like to sit down..."
BUFFY,What is it?
RILEY,"Suvolte demon. Rare, lethal ... nearly   extinct, but not nearly enough. (Buffy grinning) It's close."
RILEY,What?
BUFFY,Sorry. It's just ... you still carry around all that   James Bond stuff.
BUFFY,It's so cute! I forgot.
BUFFY,Sorry. (fake-military) Carry on.
RILEY,"(resumes walking) We've   been tear-assing through every jungle from Paraguay up, taking out nests. As   soon as we put one Suvolte down, a dozen take its place. They're breeders,   Buffy. One turns into ten, ten becomes a hundred. This gets out of hand and   there's a war with humans? Humans are gonna lose."
BUFFY,"So they're like   really mean tribbles. (Riley gives her another look) Sorry, I've been dealing   with these, these geeks, it's, it's a whole thing."
RILEY,You ready for this?
BUFFY,Yes please.
RILEY,"(yelling) National Forestry Service, we got a wild bear! Everybody   stand back! (pushes a pedestrian aside) Look out!"
RILEY,Split.
BUFFY,Riley!
RILEY,You all right?
BUFFY,I'll feel better when we catch it. But it's   too fast.
RILEY,I wouldn't necessarily say that.
BUFFY,Nice wheels.
RILEY,Came with the car.
BUFFY,(smiles) Know   where we're goin'?
RILEY,Got an idea. The tag's on-line. We'll find it.
BUFFY,How's your arm?
RILEY,It'll heal. How you doin'?
BUFFY,Complicated question.
RILEY,I just meant-
BUFFY,I know.
RILEY,"I   hear ya. Got some, uh ... big stories to tell you to. If we ever get half a   second."
BUFFY,Did you die?
RILEY,No.
BUFFY,I'm gonna win.
RILEY,"Here. (grabs something from behind the seat and gives it to her) No   offense, but this is black ops, and you look like a pylon."
BUFFY,(looks at   it) Ninja wear?
RILEY,"Battle gear. Lightweight Kevlar, state of the   art."
BUFFY,What a surprise.
RILEY,"Boys like toys. Put it on, thank me   later."
BUFFY,(smiling) You won't look?
RILEY,(staring at the road   ahead) I'm a gentleman.
BUFFY,"Okay. (begins unfolding the clothes) So ...   the black-ops life, it's workin' out for ya?"
RILEY,Don't suck.
BUFFY,They got dental?
RILEY,"(smiles) Yeah, we're covered."
RILEY,"You know, there's not many people I'd ask to risk their life for me,   Buffy. It's really good to see you."
BUFFY,Thanks.
RILEY,You're   welcome. And Buffy ... love the hair.
ANYA VOICEOVER,"I think we died in this car on the way to the airport, and   now we're stuck in hell."
XANDER,The radio said no traffic. (reaching for chips)
ANYA,"It's a   hell radio, of course it said that. We'll never get to the airport in time to   pick up your stupid uncle."
XANDER,"It just gives my uncle Rory more time at   the bar. Trust me, he'll be happy."
ANYA,(mouth full) Great. So he can   sleep off his drunken stupor on our newly re-upholstered couch.
XANDER,He   can't afford a hotel.
ANYA,Why are you defending him?
XANDER,"I'm not.   I hate my uncle. I hate my whole family. That's why I'm marrying you, to start   a new family. Have children, make them hate us, then one day they'll get   married, we'll sleep on their couch. It's the circle of life.   (smiling)"
ANYA,"Well, the Gnarals are teleporting in in twenty minutes. If   I'm not there to greet them? Somebody's getting incinerated."
XANDER,"Why   did we ever agree to have your friends, who are demons, and my family, who are   monsters, stay at our place?"
ANYA,"Well, I can only do so much, Xander.   Planning this marriage is like staging the invasion of Normandy."
XANDER,Without the laughs. We should have eloped.
ANYA,"No! I've been through too   much planning this wedding, and it is *going* to happen. It is going to be our   perfect, perfect day if I have to kill every one of our guests and half this   town to do it."
XANDER,Mm. (looks at her bag of chips) Cool Ranch?
ANYA,Cajun Fiesta.
BUFFY,End of the line? (Riley shrugs) I don't see our demon.
RILEY,It's not here.
BUFFY,Let me guess.
BUFFY,Down we go?
RILEY,Looks that way. (doing something with   equipment)
BUFFY,"That's a big first step. So, Mr. Finn, got an extra   jet-pack for a girl like me?"
RILEY,"Sorry, fresh out of jet-packs. Looks   like we'll have to share."
RILEY,"This test line's built for one, so if we go together, we're not   hauling any gear. Just be you and me."
BUFFY,I was never big on the   hardware anyway.
RILEY,You hold onto me?
BUFFY,(flirty) If that's what   it takes.
RILEY,Come on.
BUFFY,"Ready when you are, Agent Finn."
BUFFY,Riley!
WOMAN,Hey.
WOMAN,(to Riley) Hey there. (to Buffy) What exactly are you doing with my   husband?
BUFFY,Husband?
BUFFY,Wife.
BUFFY,And ... those aren't code names like Big Dog or Falcon or... (the   others looking dubious) I didn't think so.
RILEY,"Buffy, meet Sam. Sam,   Buffy."
SAM,(sincerely) Pleasure.
BUFFY,Demon.
SAM,(grins) Mine.
BUFFY,She's good.
RILEY,She's a special one. (shot of Sam punching the   demon furiously)
BUFFY,How long have you been married?
RILEY,Four   months almost.
BUFFY,Mazel tov. Any children?
RILEY,"Buffy, I meant to   tell you. When the time was right. She caught up to us a hell of a lot faster   than I would've guessed possible. She does that. (shot of Sam kicking and   punching the demon)"
BUFFY,"So, you-you guys do this often, you know, the   whole ... husband-and-wife tag-team demon fighting thing?"
RILEY,"Yeah, it's   what brought us together. I almost feel sorry for the Suvolte."
RILEY,But not quite.
BUFFY,Call this your wedding gift.
BUFFY,"(panting) So, guess that's mission accomplished. (turns   away)"
RILEY,(kneels by the demon) She killed it.
SAM,"Oh, honey ...   (putting a hand on his back, panting) That's okay."
BUFFY,"(turns back)   Okay? Wait ... you guys have been tracking this thing as a couple for two days   straight, and you ... did want it dead, right?"
BUFFY,Oh.
SAM,"Let me guess. Captain Can-Do over here (pointing her   thumb at Riley) forgot to mention that this was a homing operation. (Riley   looking embarrassed, getting something from his belt) But it's nice to finally   meet you, by the way. Knife."
BUFFY,What is a homing operation?
RILEY,It's my fault. I should have   explained.
BUFFY,That would have saved me some ... trouble.
SAM,Damn.
SAM,We're too late. Finn ... how could you recruit the Slayer without   filling her in on the objective?
BUFFY,That'd be my question.
SAM,(teasing) If we weren't under severe time constraints I'd seriously think   about ripping you a new one.
RILEY,"(smirking) Stand down,   soldier."
BUFFY,"He's your boss, too?"
SAM,"(smirking) Oh, he wishes. We   better regroup. Buffy, I hate to impose further, but ... you got a safe   house?"
BUFFY,"I, I have a house. I-I think it's safe. Sometimes you can't   even leave."
RILEY,(to Sam) I know the way. (to Buffy) And I'll fill you in. On   everything.
BUFFY,Sorry the place is such a mess. I haven't had a chance to give it a   good cleaning.
RILEY,Hey.
DAWN,Agent Finn returns.
RILEY,"Dawn. Geez, look at you.   I think you grew a foot and a half."
DAWN,(sullen) A lot can happen in a   year.
RILEY,"(chastised) Well, it's good to see you."
XANDER,"Hey, there's the man! Life taker, heartbreaker. (shakes Riley's   hand) You know, figuratively speaking."
RILEY,"Xander, Sam.   Willow..."
SAM,Hi. (all waving at each other)
RILEY,Hi. (hugs   Willow)
WILLOW,We got your call.
XANDER,"We're here to help. Just like   old times. Except, with you being all big with the married life."
RILEY,"Hear you're getting hitched yourself. Believe me, you're gonna love it. (Sam   smiling at him)"
WILLOW,"Congratulations, really, both of you."
WILLOW,(softly) Just so you know? I'm prepared to hate this woman any way   you want. (shot of Riley and Sam talking closely)
BUFFY,"Thanks, but no. I   don't wanna seem all petty."
WILLOW,"Well, that's the beauty! You can't, but   I can. Please. Let me carry the hate for the both of us."
BUFFY,Go nuts.
DAWN,So. What brings you back to town after you left suddenly with no   word?
RILEY,Sam and I have been tracking a Suvolte demon through Central   America. Killing machine. Nearly mature.
SAM,"Yeah, three months old and   growing fast."
RILEY,These things start to kill the minute they're hatched.   And leave a real clear trail.
SAM,Yeah. Just follow the villages with   nothing in them but body parts.
RILEY,"Uh ... Dawn, are you sure you wanna   be around hearing all this?"
SAM,"Oh, come on, Finn, she looks all grown-up   to me. (to Buffy) That is, if it's all right with you."
BUFFY,"Uh, sure,   yeah, it's fine."
DAWN,"So, this demon shredded your guys, and now you're   looking for a little payback?"
SAM,"(shakes head) No. It came here to the   Hellmouth to, to spawn. (sighs) But we think it already hatched its eggs   somewhere."
RILEY,And the plan was to track it. Let the demon take us to   its nest.
DAWN,And ... now they're gonna hatch a bunch of ... baby demon   things?
SAM,Unless we stop it.
BUFFY,"Which means we have to find the   nest, and fast, before Sunnydale turns into the Trouble Meat Palace."
BUFFY,I wish I'd said something else.
XANDER,"Okay, so we track down   the demon, find the nest, Mr. and Mrs. Finn here make with the killin', and   everyone goes home happy. (sits on the sofa beside Sam) But seriously, married   man. If forced to choose between a photographer and place settings-"
BUFFY,"We can't track the demon. (they look at her) I killed it. (chipper) So! Who's   hungry? We got, uh-"
DAWN,Ice cubes.
BUFFY,All you can eat.
SAM,Buffy? It's good that you killed the Suvolte before it killed us. (to Xander)   Disposable cameras.
XANDER,Di - wah?
SAM,"Yeah, you, you know, little   plastic ones, ten bucks a pop. You arrange them like table settings, guests   snap photos..."
SAM,"...breaks the ice, and when the wedding's over, you get to take home   the pictures."
XANDER,(grinning) I like it!
BUFFY,"So, demon eggs. Any timetable on when they're gonna hatch?"
RILEY,Hatching's not the problem.
SAM,"We think they're gonna be sold on the   black market. There are some foreign military powers that would love to have   their own Suvolte. You could never train it, but drop it on an urban   population..."
RILEY,And it cleanses the area.
DAWN,Is that a nice way   of saying it kills people?
SAM,"Lots of 'em. Money's been exchanged.   There's a dealer in town, calls himself the, The Doctor. Willow, you think you   can help with a little locating spell?"
WILLOW,(quietly) I can't do the   magicks.
SAM,"Oh, Riley says you're comin' on as one major-league   Wicca."
WILLOW,I got addicted. The way addicts do.
RILEY,"Two teams. No civilians. I'll, uh ... I'll go out and look for our   Doctor. You two find that nest."
BUFFY,Me and Sam together?
RILEY,"You   come across a Suvolte nest, you're gonna want backup."
SAM,"You know, I   don't wanna be dragging down the Slayer. (to Buffy) You've got speed, and   power I can't even-"
BUFFY,"Let's go. Xander, are you okay to stay with   Dawn?"
XANDER,Yeah.
RILEY,"I'll check out some bars. Willy's, some, uh,   crypts that I know."
SAM,"Hey Willow. I'm sorry, I think I really ... stepped in it in there.   (Willow not looking at her) You know, back in the jungle ... we had not one,   but two hard-core shamans working for us ... they were working the dark   magicks, and ... got addicted. And now they're gone. (Willow turns to look at   her) Gone ... as in ... there's nothing left. I've never met anyone with   enough strength to quit before."
SAM,I'm just saying.
SAM   VOICEOVER,Thanks for letting me tag along.
BUFFY,No problem.
SAM,"Maybe not for you. I gotta tell you, Buffy, I'm   a little bit intimidated. I mean, patrolling with the real live Slayer, you're   like ... Santa Claus, or Buddha, or something."
BUFFY,Fat and   jolly?
SAM,Legendary. And it's not just slayer status I'm talking about.   It's you.
BUFFY,Riley talks about me?
SAM,"He didn't say anything for a   long time, but I could tell. He was ripped up inside."
BUFFY,Good thing he   has you.
SAM,"More like miraculous. I went down to Central America with the   Peace Corps. One night, my entire infirmary got slaughtered by... (shakes her   head) I didn't know what they were. I got saved, quit the Corps, joined the   squad. My first firefight, I met Riley. (smiling) We started talking, you   know, first about tactics, missions, stuff like that. And then about   you."
BUFFY,He thinks ... I let him go.
SAM,(stops) Do you wish you   hadn't.
BUFFY,"(softly) I wish things were different. I-I'm not trying to   ... I don't ... uh, you know. (resumes walking)"
SAM,"I didn't mean to put   you on the spot, Buffy. There's no bad guys in this one. The only thing that   could ... help Riley work it out was time. Lots of time. Took him a year to   get over you."
BUFFY,I'm glad he's over me.
SAM,"So, you seeing anyone   new? Someone special?"
BUFFY,"You know, I just take my time, you know, I   don't ... I don't wanna jump right into anything, don't wanna ... you know ...   be defined by who I'm with."
SAM,"Yeah, better no guy than the wrong guy,   that's for sure."
BUFFY,"(suddenly) Sam. You know what? Um, I think we   should split up."
SAM,"(upset) Oh, I'm slowing you down. I knew I would,   this was just selfish of me."
BUFFY,"No, it's not, uh ... there's this guy,   uh, an informant, but he's twitchy. I show up with company, and, and we get   nothing."
SAM,"Cool. I'm guessing Finn needs me about now. (looking around)   He's probably off somewhere gettin' his ass kicked. (grinning) You know how   wild he gets. (backing away) Don't worry about Rye and me, we're good."
BUFFY,(to herself) I noticed.
SPIKE,"Buffy. Hey now. (puts the book down, stands) If I'd-a known you were   coming, I'd-a baked a cake."
BUFFY,I need information.
SPIKE,"Well, suppose I could be helpful. If   the price is right. (Buffy putting gloves down) I'm not sure I'm selling out   at Double Meat Palace wages, though."
BUFFY,I need to find a guy. Dealer.   Calls himself The Doctor.
SPIKE,Human?
BUFFY,His traffic   isn't.
SPIKE,Clock ticking?
BUFFY,"Whatever he's doing, he's doing it   soon."
SPIKE,(looking her up and down) Soon but not now?
BUFFY,(quietly) Tell me you love me.
SPIKE,(surprised) I love you. You   know I do.
BUFFY,Tell me you want me.
SPIKE,(whispers) I always want you. In   point of fact-
BUFFY,Shut up.
SPIKE,"Well, looky here. I don't usually use the word delicious..."
SPIKE,"...but I've gotta wager this little tableau must sting a bit, eh? Me   and your former? Must kill. What can I say? Girl just needs a little monster   in her man."
RILEY,That's not why I'm here ... Doctor.
BUFFY,Oh god.
SPIKE,"Here I thought we'd run you out of town, mate."
SPIKE,"Last time I saw you, if memory serves, you were getting the juice   sucked out of you by some undead ladies of very questionable reputation."
SPIKE,"Now, be a good tin soldier and, uh... (makes a ""go-away""   gesture)"
RILEY,Where are they ... Doctor?
SPIKE,"Where are what, and   why do you keep calling me that? (begins putting on pants)"
RILEY,"Glad to   be back in Sunnydale. The locals all speak English, and I know who to beat for   information. It's all brought me here."
SPIKE,"Look, crew cut. (fastening   his belt) She's not your bint any more. And if I can speak frankly, she always   had a little thing for me, even when she was shagging you."
RILEY,"Nice.   That's very distracting. (walks closer) Now tell me, before I get   unprofessional... (pointing his gun at Spike) ...where are the eggs,   Spike?"
SPIKE,Eggs? (scoffs) You're off your nut. It must be those drugs   they were keeping you on. I did warn you.
RILEY,"Okay. We can do this the   hard way, or we can do this the fatal way."
RILEY,Where are the eggs?
BUFFY,"Look, the Doctor, it can't be   Spike."
SPIKE,"No need to defend me, luv."
BUFFY,"Look, i-it can't be, okay? He-he's too incompetent. (Spike glaring   at her) It's just Spike, Riley."
RILEY,Right. Deadly ... amoral ... (Spike   smirking) opportunistic. (quietly) Or have you forgotten?
RILEY,I'm taking this place apart until I find that nest.
SPIKE,Over   my dead body.
RILEY,"I've seen enough of your dead body for one night,   thanks."
SPIKE,"Well, you're not gonna-"
RILEY,(OS) You coming?
SPIKE,"(angry) Oh, this is ... unconstitutional, is what it is! (grabbing a   shirt, putting it on) Here!"
SPIKE,(OS) There's nothin' to see down there!
BUFFY,"Riley, look, I'm not saying that he's good, okay, I'm just saying   that he's not capable of something as-"
SPIKE,I can explain.
RILEY,"We're gonna need more weapons. Spike   screwed up. You didn't keep 'em frozen, did you ... Doctor?"
SPIKE,"You can   stop calling me that any time. If I may, the thing of it is, I'm holding these   for a friend, who-"
BUFFY,No more games.
SPIKE,"Well, that's bloody funny coming from you! No more games? (Buffy   rolling her eyes) That's all you've ever done is play me. You keep playing   with rules you make up as you like. You know what I am. You've always known.   You come to me all the same."
RILEY,Can you shut him up?
BUFFY,Not so   far.
RILEY,You better get outta here.
RILEY,"On second thought, stick around."
BUFFY,"Riley, I-"
RILEY,"Aim high, plenty of lead."
BUFFY,I'm not   exactly gun girl.
RILEY,"You wanna live, learn fast."
BUFFY,These things? (uses the gun to club a demon as it flies at her)   Never useful.
RILEY,We have to pull out.
RILEY,We need a way to contain these things-
BUFFY,Riley!
RILEY,Get down!
ANYA VOICEOVER,"You know, if you love Riley   Finn so much, maybe you should just marry him."
XANDER,He's taken. And that's not the point.
ANYA,"So you think that their marriage is better than ours, is that   it?"
XANDER,"No! But granted, I have a hard time imagining Nick and Nora   Fury hiding out from their own relatives in the bathroom."
XANDER,(sighs) And I have no idea what Riley and Mrs. Riley's wedding was   like.
ANYA,"Well, you haven't shut up about them."
XANDER,"Well, they   have a great marriage! And it bummed Buffy out, but I can see it. And Anya ...   I really have no clue what their wedding was like."
ANYA,So our wedding...   (Xander nodding) ...is not our marriage. (smiles)
XANDER,Separate things.   One fills me with a dread akin to public speaking engagements.
ANYA,And   that would be the wedding.
XANDER,Which will be over soon.
ANYA,But   our marriage...
XANDER,That lasts forever.
ANYA,"Ah, well. That works out nicely, then."
Cut to,"exterior of the magic shop, night. Buffy and Riley emerge onto the   street, walk along the sidewalk."
BUFFY,"So, are you and Sam headed back to Central America? Or, is that   classified?"
RILEY,Nepal.
BUFFY,Sounds fun.
RILEY,I'll send you a   postcard.
RILEY,Buffy-
BUFFY,Riley-
RILEY,By mission parameters I'm done   here. But I have authorization to take the Doctor out. (pause) Do you want me   to do that?
BUFFY,(shocked) Do I want you to... (looks away) How can you   ask me ... I'm sleeping with hi-him. (carefully) I'm sleeping with   Spike.
RILEY,I had actually noticed that.
BUFFY,And then you come back   ... and did you wait until your life was absolutely perfect and then send that   demon here so you could throw it in my face?
RILEY,Look ... you think this   was easy for me?
BUFFY,"Yeah! I think it was a rollicking adventure, fun   for the whole family."
RILEY,I was terrified about seeing you   again.
BUFFY,"Well, I'm sure my incredible patheticness softened the blow   for you."
RILEY,I don't know what you're talking about.
BUFFY,"Riley, please   don't patronize-"
RILEY,Hey! You want me to say that I liked seeing you in   bed with that idiot? Or that blinding orange is your very best color? Or that   that ... burger smell is appealing?
BUFFY,(upset) You smelled the   smell?
RILEY,"Buffy, none of that means anything. It doesn't touch you.   You're still the first woman I ever loved ... and the strongest woman I've   ever known. And I'm not advertising this to the missus ... but you're still   quite the hottie."
BUFFY,"You know, it goes away after many   bathings."
RILEY,"(laughs) This isn't about who's on top. I know how lucky I   am right now. I love my work, and I love my wife."
BUFFY,I know. And I   kinda love her too.
RILEY,So you're not in the greatest place right now.   And maybe I made it worse.
BUFFY,No.
RILEY,"Wheel never stops turning,   Buffy. You're up, you're down ... it doesn't change what you are. And you are   a hell of a woman."
BUFFY,"(deep breath) Riley, that night... (Riley just   looking at her) I never got the chance ... to tell you ... how sorry I was.   About what happened between us."
RILEY,And you never have to.
SAM,"Well, the wedding itself was held in a military chopper just before a   hairy night drop into hostile territory."
XANDER,"Huh! And just curious,   what's a chopper rental run these days?"
SAM,"Oh, well, actually, we commandeered it from a local guerilla squad, so   ... cheap!"
XANDER,Oh!
SAM,Yeah.
SAM,"(to Willow) You have my email, you promise you'll keep in   touch?"
WILLOW,You won't get traced? I don't wanna lead the bad guys to   your location by mistake.
SAM,Our line's secure.
WILLOW,"(smiling) Oh, huh, duh, of course it is!   I keep thinking of you like regular people, but no, you're not."
SAM,"Oh,   right, like demon-hunting is all exotic to a girl from Sunnydale."
DAWN,"So you gonna say goodbye this time, or just ... split all   secret-agenty like last time? (sound of a helicopter)"
RILEY,Depends. I   warrant a hug?
RILEY,"Goodbye, Dawn."
DAWN,I thought it would suck less this time. It   doesn't.
SAM,"It was really nice meeting you all. (taps Riley on the shoulder, moves   away) You ready for Nepal, agent?"
RILEY,(to Xander) Soldier.
RILEY,"(to Sam) Fire-fights, bug hunts, big body counts ... yeah, I could   use a break."
WILLOW,Bye!
XANDER,Bye! Bye Riley! Bye Sam!
WILLOW,What a bitch.
SPIKE,So she's back. Thought you'd be off snogging with   soldier-boy.
BUFFY,He's gone.
SPIKE,"(looks at her) So, you come for a   bit of cold comfort? (sighs, gestures) The bed's a bit blown up, but then,   that was never our-"
BUFFY,I'm not here to-
BUFFY,"And I'm not here to bust your chops about your stupid scheme,   either. That's just you. I should have remembered."
SPIKE,"So this is worse   then, is it, this is you telling me-"
BUFFY,It's over.
SPIKE,"(smiles,   moves closer to her) I've memorized this tune, luv. Think I have the sheet   music. Doesn't change what you want."
BUFFY,I know that. (pauses) I do want   you. (Spike looking surprised) Being with you ... makes things ... simpler.   For a little while.
SPIKE,I don't call five hours straight a little   while.
BUFFY,I'm using you.
BUFFY,"I can't love you. I'm just ... being weak, and selfish..."
SPIKE,(moves even closer) Really not complaining here.
BUFFY,...and it's killing   me.
BUFFY,I have to be strong about this.
BUFFY,I'm sorry ... William.
