Willow,This is a nightmare. This is... My world is spinning.
Xander,"It's not that bad, Willow, really."
Willow,"740? Verbal?! I'm-I'm... (searches for a word) pathetic!  Illiterate! I'm Cletus, the slack-jawed yokel."
Xander,(shrugs) That's right. And the fact that your 740 verbal  closely resembles my combined scores in no way compromises your position  as the village idiot.
Willow,"I just... (sits and slouches, depressed) Where did I go wrong?"
Xander,"You did amazing, Willow. As usual."
Cordelia,You guys get your scores?
Xander,Cordelia! (points) Willow was very sad by her academic failure.  (reaches for Cordelia's score report) How did you do?
Xander,This is not good.
Cordelia,What's not good?
Xander,"Well, I'm just worried it may hurt my standing as campus stud  when people find out I'm dating a brain."
Cordelia,(yanks her scores from his hand) Please. I have *some*  experience in covering these things up.
Oz,"(to Willow) Well, I can see why you'd be upset."
Oz,That was my sarcastic voice.
Xander,"You know, it sounds a lot like your regular voice."
Oz,"I've been told that. (trying to be upbeat) But we should celebrate,  do something."
Cordelia,"Like, the four of us?"
Xander,A double date! It could have potential.
Willow,(brightens and stands up) Buffy! Hey! Did you get your SAT  scores?
Xander,"By the look on your face, I'm guessing you and I are gonna be  manning the drive-through window side by side."
Buffy,"They're just test scores, right? (hands hers to Willow) What do  they really mean, anyway?"
Willow,"(unfolds it and reads) (very excited) 1430! Buffy, you kicked  ass!"
Willow,"(more calmly) Okay, (folds the report) so academic achievement  gets me a little excited."
Xander,"Buff, that's amazing."
Cordelia,Let me see that.
Oz,"Yeah. With scores like that, you can apply pretty much anywhere you  want."
Willow,"Buffy, this could, like, change your whole future."
Buffy,(unsure what to make of it) The thought had occurred to me.
Xander,Then why the sour puss?
Buffy,I don't know. I guess... my future. I never really thought about  it. I wasn't even sure I was going to have one.
Cordelia,"(smiling hugely) Well, I think this is great! Now you can  leave and never come back!"
Cordelia,"Well, I mean that in a positive way. Get out of Sunnydale.  That's a good thing. What kind of moron would ever wanna come back here?"
Spike,"Home, sweet... (chuckles) home."
Spike,And more / Much more than this / I did it my way
Spike,Drusilla! I'm home!
Spike,"Why did you do it, baby? Why did you leave me? We were happy  here."
Spike,YOU... (swings the candlestick) STUPID... (swings again)  WORTHLESS... (swings again) BITCH! (calms a bit) Look what you've done  to me.
Xander,C'mon. It'll be fun!
Cordelia,"I don't know. I just thought we were gonna do something...  you know, classy?"
Xander,What's classier than bowling?
Cordelia,(raises her eyebrows at him) Apart from everything ever?  Let's see...
Xander,Oz and Willow are down. You're the swing vote. (skips around to  her other side) I guarantee fun.
Xander,"Hey, those are from the pier."
Cordelia,"Yeah. Uh, I just got them developed."
Xander,(not yet sure what to make of it) There's pictures. Of me. In  your locker. I never knew I was locker door material.
Cordelia,"Well... just barely. Besides, (smiles) I look really cute in  those pictures."
Oz,Hey. So what's the verdict? Do we bowl?
Cordelia,(gives in) We bowl.
Willow,Great! Double bowling date. (pats Oz's chest) I'm on Oz's team.
Xander,"Yeah? Well, (points at Oz) prepare to be crushed. (takes  Cordelia's arm) Maybe we should practice."
Cordelia,(nods) Yeah.
Willow,"They don't stand a chance. I'm really good. Or I used to be,  (works her combination) when they had the inflatable things in the  gutters."
Willow,What's this? (takes it)
Oz,It's a gift.
Willow,(smiles) What's the occasion? (unwraps it)
Oz,Pretty much *you* are.
Willow,"(excited) It's a little, uh, PEZ witch!"
Oz,It's kind of a theme present. Do you like it?
Willow,"(breathless) I like... I-I *more* than like. Oz, this is  probably the sweetest... We have to find a little PEZ werewolf, so  little PEZ witch can have a boyfriend."
Oz,I don't think they make a werewolf PEZ. You might have to settle  for a wacky cartoon dog.
Willow,This is... just so thoughtful.
Oz,"Well, I think about you."
Willow,(suddenly disappointed) Oh... I don't have anything to give  you.
Oz,"(smiles at her) Yeah, you do."
Giles,"Buffy, this is, this is remarkable."
Buffy,"So is this. (puts the thing down) Where is this retreat thingy,  the Yukon? (reaches for something else)"
Giles,"It's quite nearby, actually. (Buffy finds a compass) It's, um,  it's the clearing at the top of Breaker's Woods."
Giles,It's the site of some fascinating druidic rituals.
Buffy,"(closes the compass) Okay, but you're just going for a few days,  right? (Giles takes the compass from her) I mean, you're not gonna  settle there and grow crops or anything."
Giles,"(confused) What? Oh, my gear. No, no, this is, this is basic  necessities."
Buffy,"Giles, you pack like me."
Giles,"(gives her a little smile) Here. (hands Buffy her scores) I  suspect your mother will want to, uh, put it on the refrigerator."
Buffy,"(puts the report away) Yeah. She saw these scores, and her head  spun around and exploded."
Giles,"(unsure what she meant) I-I've been on the Hellmouth too long.  That was metaphorical, yes?"
Buffy,Yes. She was happy.
Buffy,"She started with all this crazy talk about me going to college,  maybe someplace else."
Buffy,"I know. I know, I said that you were gonna have a goat.  Responsibilities and all. I know the drill."
Giles,She may be right. (comes back out of the cage)
Buffy,"Yeah, I know, I figured you'd..."
Buffy,"Okay. Be kind, rewind."
Giles,"With scores like these, Buffy, you could have a first-rate  education. I'm, I'm not suggesting that you... ignore your calling, but,  um... you need to look to your future. (goes back to the table) And with  Faith here, i-i-it may be that you can (draws a breath) move on. For a-a  time, at least. (packs the book)"
Buffy,(unsure how to react) Wow.
Giles,"Well, let's, um, let's discuss it when I get back. I-in the  meantime, um, I'd like you to continue training while I'm, while I'm  gone, and, um, please don't do anything rash."
Buffy,"'Anything rash', meaning..."
Giles,(hesitates for an instant) Are you planning on seeing Angel?
Buffy,"Yes. Actually, I am. (Giles averts his eyes) Look, but there's  not gonna be any rash. (realizes how that sounds and gets a look from  Giles) Anywhere. (defensively) Okay. We're, we're friends. That's all  either of us wants. (looks at Giles seriously) Nothing's gonna happen."
Willow,Something's gonna happen.
Xander,Like what?
Willow,"Uh! It's a mistake! It's a terrible, fatal mistake. I see that  now."
Xander,It's just bowling.
Willow,"It's *bad* bowling. I-it's a double date, with all of us, and  they're gonna know!"
Xander,How are they gonna know?
Willow,It's a very intimate situation. It's all sexy with the smoke  and the sweating and the shoe rental...
Xander,You're turned on by rented shoes?
Willow,That's not the issue.
Xander,"Okay, well, let me ask you this: what are they gonna know? That  we're friends. Old, old friends. And maybe we've had one or two  indiscretions, but that's all past. Look. We're just very good friends  who like to hang out, and can I kiss your earlobe?"
Willow,"No! Well, okay. (jerks away) No! (holds up the dispenser) PEZ!"
Xander,Maybe bowling might be too much to handle. Man! (strokes her  hair) I wish I wasn't so attracted to you. (takes a deep breath) I wish  we could make it all stop.
Willow,Any suggestions?
Joyce,"Carnegie Mellon has a wonderful design curriculum. Oh, and Brown  University's history program is... You like history, right?"
Buffy,"Could we talk about this another time? (gets a large bowl) All  day it's been like, 'Congratulations! Go away.' (takes the bowl to the  island)"
Joyce,"That's not it. It's just you belong at a, a good old-fashioned  college with, with keg parties and boys, not here with Hellmouths and  vampires."
Buffy,Not really seeing the distinction.
Joyce,"Y'know, you're always talking about how you wish you could lead  a more normal life. Well, this is your chance!"
Buffy,"Yeah, it's just not that simple. (takes the popcorn to the bowl)  I have responsibilities. (opens the bag)"
Joyce,"I know, I know, but I spoke with Mr. Giles, and he said..."
Buffy,...that Faith could be Miss Sunnydale in the Slayer Pageant. I  know. (dumps the popcorn into the bowl)
Joyce,"It's time to think about your future, Buffy, about your whole  life. I mean, honestly, is there anything keeping you here?"
Spike,"(slurred) Yeah, you. You think I'm afraid of you?"
Spike,We were happy! You brainwashed her. I could just...
Spike,"Yeah, I'll show *you* who's a cool guy. (starts to leave) You're  goin' down."
Spike,Whoa!
Spike,This is just too much.
Shopkeeper,Did you come in through the back?
Spike,Yeah. I need a curse.
Shopkeeper,A what?
Spike,"(exasperated) A curse! Y'know, something nasty. Boils. I wanna  give him boils all over his face. You know, dripping pustules. Let's  really go for the gusto here."
Shopkeeper,"I'm hearing a lot of negative energy, and I bet..."
Spike,"(interrupts) Leprosy! Alright, a spell that makes his parts fall  off. That sounds proper."
Shopkeeper,We don't carry... (the front door chimes) leprosy.
Shopkeeper,Would you excuse me a moment?
Shopkeeper,Blessed be. Anything in particular I can help you find?
Willow,"Yeah. (holds up her notepad) It's all here on the list. (reads  down the list) Skink root, essence of rose thorn, canary feathers..."
Shopkeeper,"Aha! (smiles) A love spell. Want that old lover to come  back to you? (Spike is suddenly interested in their conversation) Are  you sure you know what you're doing, hon?"
Willow,"(flustered) No. Oh, I mean, yes! I... I know how to do a love  spell, but this is more of an anti-love spell. Yeah. Uh, kind of a de- lusting. The supplies are basically the same, right?"
Shopkeeper,(smiles) Basically. (starts to gather things) Although  raven feathers tend to breed a little more discontent than canary. Let  me just get some things...
Shopkeeper,Okay. Mm-hmm. (adds it up) That'll be $15.80 for the lot.
Willow,Thanks!
Shopkeeper,"(smiling) So, did you find a spell book?"
Spike,Forget the book.
Spike,I just got a better idea.
Allan,He's been spotted back in town.
Allan,And there was an incident at a magic shop in broad daylight.  Police had a hell of a time covering it up.
Allan,I remember. (leans against the Mayor's desk)
Allan,Should I have Mr. Trick send a... committee to deal with this?
Allan,(confused) Uh...
Allan,As good as done. (leaves the office)
Angel,"College, huh?"
Buffy,Higher education. Kind of an intense proposition.
Angel,Where do you wanna go? (slowly comes over to her)
Buffy,"(closes her brochure) I have no idea. My mom was the one that  got all these. She's so excited, she can't stop talking about it. (Angel  sits across from her) I had a really hard time coming up with an alibi  so I could come over here."
Angel,She doesn't know about me.
Buffy,"Big no. She's having enough trouble dealing with the Slayer  issue. I don't think she's ready to process the information that... you  and I are friends again. Anyway, I think this college jones is just a  reaction to the whole Slayer thing."
Angel,She wants you to get out.
Buffy,"Someplace a little less Hellmouthy. (nods) She has a point.  (draws a breath) Y'know, but there are reasons to stay, too."
Angel,What are they?
Buffy,"(taken aback) Um... you know, there's my Slayer duties,  obviously. What do you think I should do?"
Angel,"As a friend, I... (stands up) I think that you should leave.  (goes to the fireplace) This is a good opportunity for you."
Buffy,Yeah. It's not like there's any great thing keeping me here.
Buffy,Thanks for the advice. It's another perspective to consider.
Angel,Where are you going? You just got here. It's early.
Buffy,"Yeah, well, my mom starts worrying a lot earlier these days.  I'll stop by soon."
Xander,"Whoa! It smells like church in here. (sniffs) No, wait... Evil  church."
Willow,It's just chemistry stuff. An experiment.
Xander,So you said when you called. Why do I have to be here?
Willow,It'll help you on the exam. You're way behind.
Xander,"But that's why you love me, right? (bobs his head) Academically  dangerous?"
Willow,(ignores his comment) Here. (hands him a raven feather) Hold  this.
Xander,A feather. And who will I be tickling?
Willow,(warningly) Shush.
Willow,Okay. Bring mixture to a boil...
Xander,I assume this isn't going to make us late for our evening of  bowling magic?
Willow,"(jerks up) There's no magic! I mean, bowling, yeah. Cordelia  and Oz are gonna meet us here later."
Xander,Can we turn these lights on?
Xander,Is that a spell book?
Willow,"(tries to obscure it with her hand) No, no, no! Chemistry book."
Xander,Wait a minute. This is love spell stuff! You're doing a love  spell?
Willow,No! Of course not! This is a purely scientific...
Willow,...de-lusting spell... for us. I thought it would go better if  you didn't know.
Xander,"(raises his voice) Are you nuts, or have you forgotten that I  tend to have bad luck with these sorts of spells?"
Willow,(raises hers back) But you said you wished that these feelings  could just go away.
Xander,"Yeah, I wish for a *lot* of things! I told you I wished I was a  fireman when we were in sixth grade, but you didn't follow through on  that!"
Willow,"I can't do this anymore, Xander! I mean, this whole 'us' thing  is... bleagh!"
Xander,"So, do you really need to resort to the black arts to keep our  hormones in check?"
Willow,"(calmly) At this point, I'm thinking 'no'."
Xander,"I'm gonna get the lights, (walks) clean this place up before  they get here (clicks them on) and start asking questions."
Willow,Xander!
Spike,"I need to borrow the little girl. You don't mind, do you?"
Spike,Threatening me? That's not nice. (Xander gets back up) We're all  gonna be very best friends.
Willow,Xander!
Spike,A spell. For me. You're gonna do a spell for me.
Willow,"Uh, what kind of spell?"
Spike,A *love* spell! Are you brain dead? (goes to the dresser) I'm  gonna get what's mine. (grabs a bottle) What's mine. (uncorks it) Teach  her to walk out on me.
Spike,What are you staring at?
Willow,(averts her eyes) Nothing.
Spike,"You can do it, right? You can make Dru love me again? Make her  crawl!"
Willow,I-I can try.
Spike,"(grabs her neck) What are you talking about, trying? You'll do  it!"
Willow,"Yes, I'll do it!"
Spike,"You lie to me, and I'll shove this through your face! You want  that?"
Willow,(terrified) No...
Spike,Right through to your BRAIN!
Willow,"No, please, no..."
Spike,She wouldn't even kill me.
Spike,"She just left. She didn't even care enough to cut off my head or  set me on fire. (sniffs) I mean, is that too much to ask? You know? Some  little sign that she cared?"
Spike,"It was that truce with Buffy that did it. Dru said I'd gone  soft. Wasn't demon enough for the likes of her. And I told her it didn't  mean anything, I was thinking of her the whole time, but she didn't  care. So, we got to Brazil, and she was... she was just different. I  gave her everything: beautiful jewels, beautiful dresses with beautiful  girls in them, but nothing made her happy. And she would fliiirt!  (sniffs) I caught her on a park bench, making out with a *chaos* demon!  Have you ever seen a chaos demon? They're all slime and antlers. They're  disgusting."
Spike,"She only did it to hurt me. (he takes his hand off of her) So I  said, 'I'm not putting up with this anymore.' And she said, 'Fine!' And  I said, 'Yeah, I've got an unlife, you know!' And then she said... she  said we could still be friends. (leans over and sobs on Willow's  shoulder) God, I'm so unhappy!"
Willow,"(tentatively pats his knee) There, there."
Spike,"I mean, friends! How could she be so cruel?"
Spike,Mmm. That smell... Your neck...
Spike,I haven't had a woman in weeks.
Willow,Whoa! No! Hold it!
Spike,"Well, unless you count that shopkeeper. (stands up)"
Willow,"(panting with fright) Now, now, hold on! I-I'll do your spell  for you, and, and, and I'll get you Drusilla back, but, but there will  be no bottle-in-face, and there will be no 'having' of any kind with me.  Alright?"
Spike,Alright. (pushes her away) Get started.
Willow,"Now, I'm not a real witch, you know. I-I don't know if this is  gonna work right away."
Spike,"Well, if at first you don't succeed, I'll kill him (indicates  Xander), and you try again."
Willow,(looks through the supplies) This isn't enough.
Spike,What? (comes toward her)
Willow,"(nervously) Well, there are other ingredients, a-and a-a-a  book. I need a, a spell book. This isn't it."
Spike,"You've got one, though, at home?"
Willow,Not at home. I left it somewhere.
Spike,(gets in her face) Where?
Cordelia,Thank God you are here.
Buffy,Yeah! Not all of us have dates tonight.
Oz,Something's up.
Cordelia,We were supposed to meet in here. I don't know what could  have happened.
Buffy,What is all this stuff? I'm thinking weird science.
Cordelia,Was Willow messing with her magic tricks again? Maybe they  disappeared. Maybe she turned Xander into something ishy!
Buffy,"(looks around) Whatever happened, there was obviously a fight."
Oz,I don't see any blood.
Buffy,"Yeah, either they were taken, or they ran, or maybe..."
Cordelia,(points) You're having too many ors! Pick one!
Buffy,"I don't know. I need you guys to find Giles, okay? I'm gonna  look for them. Maybe they didn't get too far."
Cordelia,Where is Giles?
Buffy,"Uh, he's at a retreat in the clearing in Breaker's Woods."
Oz,"Yeah, I know the spot, but it's like a forty-five minute drive."
Buffy,So motor!
Buffy,Giles?
Joyce,"(through the phone) Hi, Buffy. You still working out?"
Buffy,"Uh, no, Mom, actually..."
Joyce,"I was hoping that we could schedule a college talk later  tonight. I admit I... (cut to her in the kitchen) overreacted before.  You don't have to go all the way across the country. (sits at the  island) I, um, picked up some brochures from some nearby schools, okay?"
Buffy,"(cut to her) That's great, but now's really not a good time..."
Spike,"(through the phone) Hello, Joyce."
Spike,"So I'm strolling through the park, looking for a meal, and I  happen to walk by, and she's making out with the chaos demon! And so I  said, 'You know, I don't have to put up with this.' And she said,  'Fine!' So I said, 'Fine, do whatever you like!' I mean, I thought we  were going to make up, you know."
Joyce,"(sits across from him) Well, she sounds very unreasonable."
Spike,She is. She's out of her mind. (sniffs) That's what I miss most  about her. (smiles)
Joyce,"Well, Spike, sometimes even when two people seem right for each  other, their lives just take different paths. When Buffy's father and  I..."
Spike,"(interrupts) No, this is different. Our love was eternal.  Literally. (calms down) You got any of those little marshmallows?"
Joyce,"Well, lemme look."
Angel,Spike.
Joyce,"Oh, my God. Get out of here!"
Spike,"(gets up behind Joyce, smiling) Yeah. You're not invited."
Joyce,He's crazy. He'll kill us.
Spike,"Not while I breathe. Well, actually, I don't breathe. (taunts  Angel)"
Angel,"Joyce, listen to me."
Joyce,"You get out of this house, or I will stake you myself."
Spike,You're a very bad man.
Angel,"(seething with anger) Joyce, you can't trust him. Invite me in."
Angel,"You touch her, and I'll cut your head off!"
Spike,Yeah? You and what army?
Buffy,That would be me.
Buffy,"Angel, why don't you come on in?"
Joyce,"Oh! Oh, no!"
Buffy,"You shouldn't have come back, Spike."
Spike,I do what I please.
Joyce,"Okay, I-I'm confused again."
Spike,Willow!
Buffy,(stays her thrust) You took Willow.
Spike,"You do me now, you'll never find the little witch."
Joyce,(confused) Willow's a witch?
Buffy,And Xander?
Spike,"Him, too."
Joyce,"What, Xander's a witch? I..."
Angel,Where are they?
Spike,"(shoves Angel off) Doesn't work like that, peaches. And when did  you become all soul-having again? I thought you outgrew that. (to Buffy)  Your friend's gonna work a little magic for me. She does my spell, I let  them both go."
Buffy,"You're not famous for keeping your promises, Spike."
Spike,"Well, you and your great poof here wanna tag along, that's fine.  But you get in my way, and *you* kill your friends."
Cordelia,What if they were kidnapped by Colombian drug lords? They  could be cutting off Xander's ear right now! Or other parts.
Cordelia,Hello?
Oz,It's Willow. She's nearby.
Cordelia,What? You can smell her? She doesn't even wear perfume.
Oz,She's afraid.
Cordelia,"Oh, my God. Is this some sort of residual werewolf thing?  This is very disturbing."
Oz,I really agree.
Spike,"Look, I just need a few supplies, and then I'll take you to...  (stops and grabs his head) Oh, God."
Buffy,What's wrong? Not that I care.
Spike,"Oh... My head. I think I'm sobering up. It's horrible. (bends  over) Oh, God. I wish I was dead."
Buffy,"(pulls out a stake) Well, if you close your eyes and wish real  hard..."
Spike,(straightens up) Hey! Back off!
Angel,"(gets between them) Buffy, we still need him to find the others."
Buffy,(lowers her stake) Need him? He's probably just got them locked  up in the factory.
Spike,"Well, hey, how thick do you think I am?"
Buffy,Fine. Can we just get this over with?
Spike,"Oh, God."
Angel,Now what?
Spike,We killed a homeless man on this bench. Me and Dru. Those were  good times.
Spike,"(chuckles) You know, he begged for mercy, and you know, that  only made her bite harder."
Buffy,I guess you had to be there.
Buffy,Your work?
Spike,Here's your list. (hands it to Buffy)
Buffy,"(reads) 'Essence of violet, cloves...' Angel?"
Angel,Right. (starts to look)
Buffy,'Set of runic tablets.' Spike can get the rat's eyes.
Spike,I used to bring her rats. With the morning paper.
Buffy,Great. More moping. That's gonna get her back.
Spike,The spell's gonna get her back.
Angel,Lot of trouble for somebody who doesn't even care about you.
Spike,Shut your gob!
Angel,She really is just kind of fickle.
Spike,SHUT UP!
Spike,"(yells) What do you know? It's your fault, the both of you! She  belongs with me. (sobs) I'm nothing without her."
Buffy,"That I'll have to agree with. You're pathetic, you know that?  You're not even a loser anymore, you're a shell of a loser."
Spike,Yeah. You're one to talk. (goes back to looking for stuff)
Buffy,Meaning?
Spike,"(faces them) The last time I looked in on you two, you were  fighting to the death. Now you're back making googly-eyes at each other  like nothing happened. Makes me want to heave. (turns away)"
Buffy,I don't know what you're talking about.
Spike,"Oh, yeah. You're just friends."
Angel,That's right.
Spike,"(faces them) You're *not* friends. You'll never be friends.  You'll be in love till it kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag,  and you'll hate each other till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be  friends. (points at his temple) Love isn't brains, children, it's  blood... (clasps his chest) blood screaming inside you to work its will."
Spike,"*I* may be love's bitch, but at least *I'm* man enough to admit  it."
Spike,Hmm! (grabs the bottle) Eye of rat.
Willow,Xander? (sits on the bed) Are you okay?
Xander,"Dizzy. (winces) Kind of nauseous, too. Do I remember having a  fight with Spike?"
Willow,You do.
Xander,"I won, right? Kicked his ass?"
Willow,You were real brave. Do you need to barf?
Xander,"No, I'll be okay. (looks around) Where are we?"
Willow,The factory. We're locked in the basement.
Xander,That burnt-out place in the middle of nowhere? So we're pretty  much in a 'scream all you want' scenario.
Willow,Pretty much.
Xander,Why didn't he just kill us?
Willow,He-he wants me to do a love spell.
Xander,What?
Willow,Drusilla broke up with him.
Xander,"Gee, and we had all hoped those crazy kids would make it work."
Willow,"He's out of control. I mean, not that he was Joe Restraint in  the old days."
Xander,(tries again to sit up) So what are our options? (winces)
Willow,"Well, I figure either... I refuse to do the spell and he kills  us, or I do the spell and he kills us."
Xander,Give me a third option.
Willow,"He's so drunk he forgets about us, and we starve to death.  That's sort of the best one."
Xander,"Will, we're not gonna die. (tries to get up, Willow helps) If  he's so drunk, he'll get sloppy, and then I'll make my move. (they  collapse back onto the bed) As long as my move doesn't involve standing  up or using my limbs, we'll be okay."
Willow,We're not supposed to.
Xander,Exemption for impending death situation.
Cordelia,"Oh, God!"
Xander,"Oh, God."
Willow,"Oh, God, Oz..."
Oz,We have to get outta here.
Xander,"(gets up) Cordy, I..."
Xander,Cordelia!
Xander,Cordelia!
Cordelia,(whispers) I fell...
Buffy,"Okay, Spike, we got the stuff. Where are they?"
Spike,What's your hurry?
Buffy,My hurry is my intense desire to get you out of my life. You  tend to cause trouble.
Spike,I'll be out of your life in a few short hours. No trouble at  all.
Lenny,"Hello, Spike."
Buffy,No trouble at all.
Spike,Lenny. How have you been?
Lenny,Better since you left. You should have stayed gone.
Spike,Is that right? (tosses his bag aside)
Buffy,"You know, he was just leaving. (to Spike) Don't you start  anything."
Spike,This pissant used to work for me.
Buffy,(to Angel) The guys are in trouble. We can't risk this.
Angel,"Look, I don't think we have a choice."
Lenny,You other two can walk away from this.
Spike,"(to Buffy) I die, your chums die."
Buffy,(to Lenny) Sorry. We're staying.
Lenny,Not for long!
Buffy,Go!
Spike,This should be a kick.
Buffy,I violently dislike you.
Willow,Be careful.
Xander,Yeah.
Willow,"Don't move, Cordy! Oz went to get help!"
Buffy,(to Angel) We need to get out of here!
Angel,Can we get to the roof?
Lenny,"Yeah. I heard you'd gone soft. Sad to see it, man."
Spike,(incredulous) Soft?
Lenny,"Yeah, like baby food."
Spike,"(smiling) Well, then, let's give baby a taste."
Angel,I'm alright.
Buffy,You're not up to your full strength yet.
Angel,That window's about to go.
Angel,Buffy.
Spike,Baby like his supper? Baby like his supper?
Spike,Why doesn't baby have a nap?
Buffy,Spike! Get down!
Spike,"Now, that was fun."
Spike,"(smiling) Oh, don't *tell* me that wasn't fun. (chuckles) Oh,  God! It's been so long since I had a decent spot of violence. (stops and  considers) Really puts things in perspective."
Spike,"(sarcastically) Oh, yeah. You two. Just friends. No danger  there."
Buffy,Could we just do the damn spell now?
Spike,"Oh, sod the spell. (waves it off) Your friends are at the  factory."
Spike,"(smiling) I'm really glad I came here, you know? I've been all  wrongheaded about this. Weeping, crawling, blaming everybody else. I  want Dru back, I've just gotta be the man I was, (stands proud) the man  she loved. I'm gonna do what I shoulda done in the first place: I'll  find her, wherever she is, tie her up, torture her until she likes me  again."
Spike,(smiles thoughtfully) Love's a funny thing.
Xander,(very worried) Cordy... Please hold on. (strokes her hair)
Cordelia,(weakly) Xander? (looks blankly) I can't see you...
Xander,Cordy!
Priest,"He created all things in order that they might exist. And the  generative forces of this world are wholesome, and there is no  destructive poison in them. For the dominion of Hades is not on Earth,  for righteousness is immortal."
Buffy,So Cordelia's gonna be okay?
Willow,She lost a lot of blood. None of her vitals were punctured.
Buffy,Has she talked to Xander yet?
Willow,She wasn't allowed to have visitors at first. He's gonna see  her today.
Buffy,And Oz?
Willow,"I never knew there was anything inside me that could feel this  bad. For the longest time, I didn't know what I wanted. I wanted  everything. And now... I just... I just want him to talk to me again."
Buffy,Just give it some time. And be prepared for some groveling.
Willow,"Oh, I'm ready. I'm all *over* groveling."
Buffy,"Good. Because, you know, I hear sometimes it works."
Xander,Can I come in?
Xander,They wouldn't let me see you until now.
Xander,Those are flowers.
Xander,"Look, Cordy, I want you to know that I..."
Cordelia,(weakly) Xander?
Xander,(hopefully) Yeah.
Cordelia,Stay away from me.
Angel,Hey. (stands up) I was wondering when you were coming.
Buffy,I'm not coming back.
Buffy,"We're not friends. We never were. And I can fool Giles, and I  can fool my friends, but I can't fool myself. (shakes her head) Or  Spike, for some reason. What I want from you I can never have. You don't  need me to take care of you anymore. So I'm gonna go."
Angel,I don't accept that.
Buffy,You have to.
Angel,How can...
Angel,There's gotta be some way we can still see each other.
Buffy,There is: tell me that you don't love me.
Spike,"I plan each charted course / Each little step along the highway  / And more, much more than this"
Spike,I did it my way
