I know it looks like a closet,   but it's a room now. (Buffy and Dawn follow Xander into the apartment) You're   not gonna touch my food. I take the first shower in the morning, and if I use   up all the hot water, (show Spike standing at the doorway) that's your tough   noogies. (to Buffy) And I hate this plan. (to Spike) Are you keeping up, or   do you need some kind of English-to-ConstantPainInMyAss translation?"
BUFFY,"<br>  (leans forward to remind Xander) Invitation."
XANDER,"<br>  (to Buffy) Is there something more emphatic than hate? Can I revile the plan?   Fine. (to Spike) I invite you in. (Spike enters) Nimrod. (stands in front of   his closet)"
SPIKE,"<br>  Don't want your soddin' food anyway."
XANDER,"<br>  (to Buffy) I just don't understand when his problems became your problems&#151;more   specifically mine."
BUFFY,"<br>  The school basement is making him crazy. We can't just leave him there."
XANDER,"<br>  Why not? Crazy-Basement-Guy is better than Stalking-Buffy-Guy."
DAWN,"<br>  It's true. You guys aren't... You're not starting up again with the whole&#151;"
BUFFY,"<br>  No. A thousand gallons of no. OK, it's just&#151;things are different now&#151;he has   a soul."
XANDER,"<br>  I'm sure that'll be a real comfort when he soulfully attacks you again."
DAWN,"<br>  Yeah, what does that mean exactly&#151;that Spike is all soul-having?"
BUFFY,"<br>  I don't know, but he's been through a lot, OK, and nobody's attacking&#151;"
SPIKE,"<br>  Buffy&#151; Sorry."
BUFFY,"<br>  No, it's me. I-I just&#151;"
SPIKE,"<br>  I'll go. This can't work."
BUFFY,"<br>  It will. I-it already is. OK, you know, you've been out of the basement for   half an hour, and you've already stopped talking to invisible people."
SPIKE,"<br>  Bollocks."
BUFFY,"<br>  OK, so there was that one episode in the car, but&#151;"

BUFFY,"<br>  What's what?"
DAWN,"<br>  Last night, you said you weren't helping Spike out of pity. What is it?"
BUFFY,"<br>  It's a good question. (sips her drink through a straw)"
DAWN,"<br>  Is sitting there drinking soda some kind of a Zen non-answer?"
BUFFY,"<br>  (puts sunglasses on top of her head) No, I just... I don't know what I'm feeling.   I think I can't stand him, but sometimes..."
DAWN,"<br>  You love him?"
BUFFY,"<br>  No. I&#151;I feel for him."
DAWN,"<br>  Feel what, exactly?"
BUFFY,"<br>  (shakes her head) Dawn..."
DAWN,"<br>  No, I'm&#151;I'm just trying to understand. I mean, none of it makes sense. First   you say Spike disgusts you, but secretly you two are doing it like bunnies.   And then Spike says he'd die for you, but he tries to rape you."
BUFFY,"<br>  (sighs) For the record, Spike knew how wrong it was. That's why he went away."
DAWN,"<br>  But to get a soul? Like that would make him a better man? Xander had a soul   when he stood Anya up at the altar. And now he says he still wants her? I just   don't think it's the school basement that's making people crazy."
BUFFY,"<br>  (sighs) I should really get back. You comin' with? (gathers her things)"
DAWN,"<br>  I just don't see why people bother. I mean, you put all this energy into chasing   and having and brooding and&#151; I just don't understand these relationships where   you all do insane things."
