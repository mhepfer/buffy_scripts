"1INT.CHAPEL     AT CEMETERY - NIGHT<br>    There is a large, simple, gothic crucifix at the front of the chapel that     can be seen by looking directly down the central aisle. Spike embraces the     crucifix, resting one arm over each side of the cross bar, and resting his     head in the corner of the vertex. His body is sizzling and smoke is rising     from where it touches the cross. A close-up of Buffy's face shows that she     is crying now. From where she stands, Spike's exhausted body hanging limply     on the cross resembles Jesus (except the view is of Spike's back).","</p>  <p><b>Cut to:</b>"

BUFFY,"<br>    (looks into Angel's eyes, smiling) Angel, what are you doing&#151; (shakes     her head) Don't even. I just want to bask. (looks into Angel's eyes, smiling,     for a few seconds, then snaps out of it) OK, I'm basked. What are you doing     here?"
ANGEL,"<br>    Not saving the damsel in distress, that's for sure."
BUFFY,"<br>    Oh, you know me. (picks up scythe) Not much with the damseling."
ANGEL,"<br>    Got your share of distress, though. (walks to the wall)"
BUFFY,"<br>    You heard?"
ANGEL,"<br>    (picks up a file folder from a bench by the wall) I got coverage on the whole     thing. It's very gripping. It needs a third act."
BUFFY,"<br>    (shakes her head at him) You have to leave L.A."
ANGEL,"<br>    It's the First, right? The First evil. The power that tried to convince me     to kill myself."
BUFFY,"<br>    Yeah. It's gotten a little more ambitious since then. It's raising an army."
ANGEL,"<br>    Yeah, well, it failed once, and I'm here to tell you&#151;"

BUFFY,"<br>    Who does nowadays?"
ANGEL,"<br>    (lying on the floor, regains consciousness and stands, angrily) OK, now I'm     pissed. Where is he?"
BUFFY,"<br>    (looks to her right, then to her left, then at Angel) He had to split. (giggles     devilishly)"
BUFFY/FIRST,"<br>    (whispering to Spike, who's still watching Buffy from the shadows) Yeah, she     needs you real bad."
BUFFY,"<br>    I'll have the guys go through that. See if there's anything new. Reliable     source?"
ANGEL,"<br>    Not remotely."
BUFFY,"<br>    Mm, any port in an apocalypse."
ANGEL,"<br>    I, uh, brought something else as well."
BUFFY,"<br>    (shakes her head) I can already tell you, I have nothing that goes with that."
ANGEL,"<br>    It's not for you."
BUFFY,"<br>    Splainy?"
ANGEL,"<br>    I don't know everything. It's very powerful and probably very dangerous. It     has a purifying power, a cleansing power, possibly scrubbing bubbles. The     translation is, uh&#151;anyway, it bestows strength to the right person who     wears it."
BUFFY,"<br>    And the right person is?"
ANGEL,"<br>    Someone ensouled, but stronger than human. A champion. As in me."
BUFFY,"<br>    Or me."
ANGEL,"<br>    No. I don't know nearly enough about this to risk you wearing it. Besides,     you got that real cool axe-thing going for you."
BUFFY,"<br>    So you're gonna be with me in this."
ANGEL,"<br>    Shoulder to shoulder. I'm yours."
BUFFY,"<br>    No."

BUFFY,"<br>    'Cause I can't risk you."
ANGEL,"<br>    You need me in this."
BUFFY,"<br>    No, I need you gone."
ANGEL,"<br>    Why?"
BUFFY,"<br>    If I lose, if this thing gets past Sunnydale, then it's days&#151;maybe hours&#151;before     the rest of the world goes. I need a second front, and I need you to run it."
ANGEL,"<br>    OK... (crosses his arms) that's one reason. What's the other?"
BUFFY,"<br>    (walks out of the tomb) There is no other."

ANGEL,"<br>    Is it Spike? (Buffy stops walking, turns to face Angel) You're not telling     me something. And his scent, I remember it pretty well."
BUFFY,"<br>    You vampires. Did anybody ever tell you the whole smelling people thing's     a little gross? (walks away)"
ANGEL,"<br>    (follows) Is he your boyfriend?"
BUFFY,"<br>    Is that your business?"
ANGEL,"<br>    You in love with him? OK, maybe I'm outta line, but this is kind of a curve     ball for me. I mean, we are talking about Spike here."
BUFFY,"<br>    It's different. He's different. He has a soul now."
ANGEL,"<br>    (stops) Oh. (looks up) Well."
BUFFY,"<br>    What?"
ANGEL,"<br>    That's great. (mumbling to himself) Everyone's got a soul now."
BUFFY,"<br>    He'll make a difference."
ANGEL,"<br>    (mumbling) You know, I started it. The whole having a soul. Before it was     all the cool new thing."
BUFFY,"<br>    Oh, my God. Are you 12?"
ANGEL,"<br>    I'm getting the brush off for Captain Peroxide. It doesn't necessarily bring     out the champion in me."
BUFFY,"<br>    You're not getting the brush off. Are you just gonna come here and go all     Dawson on me every time I have a boyfriend?"
ANGEL,"<br>    Aha! (points) Boyfriend!"
BUFFY,"<br>    He's not. But...he is in my heart."
ANGEL,"<br>    That'll end well. (walks away, leans on a tombstone)"
BUFFY,"<br>    What was the highlight of our relationship? When you broke up with me or when     I killed you? I'm well aware of my stellar history with guys... (sighs, leans     beside Angel) And, no, I don't see fat grandchildren in the offing with Spike,     but I don't think that really matters right now. (chuckles) You know, in the     midst of all this insanity, a couple things are actually starting to make     sense. And the guy thing&#151; (sighs) I always feared there was something     wrong with me, you know, because I couldn't make it work. But maybe I'm not     supposed to."
ANGEL,"<br>    Because you're the slayer?"
BUFFY,"<br>    (looks at Angel) Because&#151;OK, I'm cookie dough. I'm not done baking. I'm     not finished becoming whoever the hell it is I'm gonna turn out to be. I make     it through this, and the next thing, and the next thing, and maybe one day     I turn around and realize I'm ready. I'm cookies. And then, you know, if I     want someone to eat&#151; (eyes go wide as she catches herself) or enjoy warm,     delicious cookie me, then...that's fine. That'll be then. When I'm done."
ANGEL,"<br>    Any thoughts on who might enjoy&#151; (sighs, irritated) Do I have to go with     the cookie analogy?"
BUFFY,"<br>    I'm not really thinking that far ahead. That's kind of the point."
ANGEL,"<br>    (hands the amulet to Buffy) I'll go start working on the second front. Make     sure I don't have to use it. (walks away)"
BUFFY,"<br>    (calls after him) Angel. (he turns to look at her) I do... sometimes think     that far ahead."
ANGEL,"<br>    Sometimes is something. (smiles, walks away)"
BUFFY,"<br>    Be a long time coming. Years, if ever."

BUFFY,"<br>    (rolls her eyes) Let me guess. You can smell him."

BUFFY,"<br>    (her eyes widen with excitement) There could be oil of some kind involved."
SPIKE,"<br>    (walks up to Buffy) Where's the trinket?"
BUFFY,"<br>    The who-ket?"
SPIKE,"<br>    The pretty necklace your sweetie-bear gave you. The one with all the power.     I believe it's mine now."
BUFFY,"<br>    How do you figure?"
SPIKE,"<br>    Someone with a soul, but more than human? Angel meant to wear it, that means     I'm the qualified party. (holds out his hands)"
BUFFY,"<br>    It's volatile. We don't know&#151;"
SPIKE,"<br>    You'll be needing someone strong to bear it, then. You planning on giving     it to Andrew?"
BUFFY,"<br>    (looks at the amulet, then at Spike) Angel said the amulet was meant to be     worn by a champion."
SPIKE,"<br>    Been called a lot of things in my time."
BUFFY,"<br>    (coyly) Faith still has my room."
SPIKE,"<br>    Well, you're not staying here. You can't buy me off with shiny beads and sweet     talk. You got Angel breath. I'm not gonna just let you whack me back and forth     like a rubber ball. I've got my pride, you know."
BUFFY,"<br>    I understand. (turns to walk away)"
SPIKE,"<br>    (cuts her off) Clearly you don't, 'cause the whole &quot;having my pride&quot;     thing was just a smokescreen."
BUFFY,"<br>    (sighs with relief) Oh, thank God."

CALEB/FIRST,"<br>    Pretty, ain't it?"
BUFFY,"<br>    You're not him."
CALEB/FIRST,"<br>    No, you killed him right and proper. Terrible loss. This man was my good right     arm. 'Course, it don't pain me too much. Don't need an arm. Got an army."
BUFFY,"<br>    An army of vampires. However will I fight&#151;"
CALEB/FIRST,"<br>    Every day our numbers swell. But then you do have an army of your own. Some     thirty-odd pimply-faced girls, don't know the pointy end of a stake. (feigns     concern) Maybe I should call this off."
BUFFY,"<br>    Have you ever considered a cool name? I mean, since you're incorporeal and     basically powerless. How about &quot;The Taunter?&quot; Strikes fear in the     heart&#151;"
CALEB/FIRST,"<br>    I will overrun this Earth. And when my army outnumbers the humans on this     Earth, the scales will tip and I will be made flesh."
BUFFY,"<br>    Talk on. I'm not afraid of you."
CALEB/FIRST,"<br>    (rolls eyes) Then why aren't you asleep in your dead lover's arms? (looks     over at Spike) 'Cause he can't help you.
