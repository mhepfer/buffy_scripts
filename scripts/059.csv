Willow,Hey look. Parker's here. You're not looking? He looks really cute in green.
Buffy,Teal. He's reflected in the mirror.
Oz,Hey. You guys ready to load up and go?
Buffy,No I'm not.
Willow,"No, you're not."
Buffy,"Oh, I so am."
Parker,Hi.
Buffy,Hi.
Buffy,How silly of me not to have planned ahead.
Willow,Bye.
Parker,See you guys.
Willow,"Uh, Devon. Aren't they supposed to dance?"
Oz,"Well, we can glue them to the dance floor."
Devon,I didn't mean with real glue. You got that right?
Harmony,"Willow, hi."
Willow,"Harmony, hey. I haven't seen you since -"
Harmony,Since graduation. Big snake huh?
Willow,"Yeah. So, how was your summer vacation?"
Harmony,Well I was gonna go to France. But I didn't. I was dying to see the stores.
Willow,"Yeah, and the museums."
Harmony,Museums?
Harmony,You were always so funny Willow. You haven't changed a bit.
Willow,"No, you neither."
Harmony,"Oh, maybe a little."
Willow,Back off Harmony.
Buffy,Mostly I hang out. And do ... stuff.
Parker,"Yeah, I was into that for a while. Hey, what's that."
Buffy,What's what?
Parker,You have a scar.
Buffy,"Yeah ... right ... angry puppy. So, I get to see any of your scars?"
Parker,"Oh, mine are all psychological."
Buffy,"Please, those are the best kind."
Parker,Well my father died last year.
Buffy,I don't think I've ever met that type.
Buffy,Also a valid life choice.
Parker,It's cool to find someone else who understands.
Buffy,Yes.
Xander,I am not enjoying this.
Giles,Well shelve them correctly and we can finish.
Xander,I don't get your crazy system.
Giles,System? It's called the alphabet.
Xander,Huh. Would you look at that.
Anya,You should lock your door.
Giles,"Believe me, I'm kicking myself."
Xander,Anya? Last time I saw you fleeing in terror. So how'd that work out for you?
Anya,Your mother said you were working here.
Xander,Yeah I need some money.
Anya,(Abruptly) Where is our relationship going?
Xander,Our what? Our who?
Xander,I ... Uh ... We have a relationship?
Anya,Yeah. We went to the prom.
Anya,"I can't stop thinking about you. Sometimes in my dreams, you're all naked."
Anya,Okay. How?
Xander,I don't know. I just - happens.
Parker,It's nice.
Oz,"Hey. Hi, hi. Remember Harmony."
Willow,She's back from her summer vacation. And she's a little bit different.
Buffy,Different?
Willow,Paler.
Buffy,Neck. Paler. The puppy. The angry puppy.
Oz,"Yeah, we came to warn you about the - angry puppy."
Buffy,"I um, should really take care of this now."
Parker,I'll pick you up tomorrow night for the party.
Buffy,I can't wait.
Willow,(In a small voice.) Get in now?
Buffy,Harmony. A vampire? She must be dying without a reflection.
Buffy,'My boyfriend.'
Buffy,"Guy dating Harmony dead. Must be like, the most tolerant guy in the world."
Harmony,Hi baby. I'm back.
Spike,You'd better be more than sure. Cause I'd hate to have to hurt you.
Vampire,"I swear, I swear."
Harmony,How's my little Blondie bear?
Spike,"Harm, does this look like a good time?"
Harmony,But you almost killed her last year. Suddenly it's a big deal.?
Spike,"SOD OFF! Now go eat something, I've got work to do."
Harmony,This one tastes funny. Take me out to eat.
Spike,He's perfectly fresh.
Spike,Harm!
Harmony,I want to go to a party.
Harmony,Oh. Right here baby. In front of Bernie.
Spike,You'd like that wouldn't you.
Harmony,Maybe I would. After a party.
Spike,Tonight. I'll take you somewhere nice.
Parker,Some party huh? Last day in Rome.
Buffy,Better. No old Romans.
Parker,You want to dance?
Buffy,No. Let's have a meaningful talk instead.
Buffy,Spike. (Pauses looking amused.) And Harmony.
Harmony,Buffy. Hi. What a cute outfit. Last year.
Spike,Well this is interesting. Sort of a double date.
Parker,"Looks like your friend started the party a little early, huh?"
Spike,"So, let's have a look at the new boy."
Parker,"(Holds out his hand.) Hi, I'm Parker."
Spike,He's got. What's the word? Vulnerability.
Buffy,And you with Harmony. What'd you do? Loose a bet?
Harmony,Hey.
Spike,"Actually, how we met. It's a funny story."
Buffy,Stay here.
Buffy,What's the matter Spike? Dru dump you again.
Spike,Maybe I left her.
Harmony,She left him for a fungus demon. That's all he talks about most days.
Spike,Harm! We are going. It isn't time yet.
Harmony,"Yeah, but as soon as we have the gem of amara, you're gonna be sorr-"
Spike,Argh!
Harmony,What? Ow!
Xander,Come in.
Xander,Anya. Hi again.
Xander,Yeah I suppose. Would you like something? I have cran-apple?
Anya,"Yeah, alright."
Xander,You know it is customary to call before you show up. Not that -
Giles,The gem of amara. Are you sure?
Buffy,"Yeah, what's up?"
Buffy,"Uh, oh, it's just, uh, it's not real."
Buffy,"Well, Spike seems to think it exists. And he's looking in Sunnydale."
Buffy,"Uh, huh. Sleepy. Yawn. Bye."
Harmony,Is Antonio Banderas a vampire?
Spike,No.
Harmony,Can I make him a vampire?
Spike,Harm. Will you shut the hell up?!
Harmony,See.
Spike,I've got an extra set of chains.
Harmony,Just because Dorkus went in for that -
Spike,Dru-scilla. Say her name.
Harmony,Dorkus.
Spike,Bite your tongue.
Harmony,Do it for me.
Xander,"So, the crux of this plan is -"
Anya,Sexual intercourse. I've said it like a dozen times.
Xander,"Uh, huh. Just working through a little hysterical deafness here."
Anya,"Oh, I have condoms. Some are black."
Xander,That's... that's very considerate.
Xander,And the amazing thing... still more romantic than Faith.
Anya,Fabric softener.
Buffy,Parker. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find you.
Parker,I was getting a little worried.
Buffy,"Um, no. No we really, really didn't."
Buffy,What am I supposed to do? Stand over here and watch?
Parker,"Well, I declared premed. But I hated it. So I switched to history."
Buffy,History? Fascinating dates and compelling faces.
Buffy,Making a choice.
Giles,"Buffy are you there? Call me, I need to talk to you right away."
Buffy,Parker?
Buffy,Just shirt. Pants. Everybody needs pants.
Parker,"Hey, you're up."
Buffy,You're here.
Parker,I live here.
Buffy,"Oh, I just, didn't know where you were."
Parker,Actually my mom's coming to visit.
Parker,"Absolutely, I'll give you a call."
Buffy,"Great. Oh, uh, one more thing before I go."
Parker,A kiss.
Buffy,"Well I was going to go with pants, but a kiss is good too."
Anya,"So, I'm over you now."
Xander,"Um, Ok."
Anya,Okay?!
Xander,Yeah...
Spike,"Harm, what are you doing."
Harmony,I'm writing Spike loves Harmony on your back.
Spike,Why?
Harmony,"I don't know, it's fun. I'm bored. You can write on me."
Spike,I've got to get back to work.
Harmony,You love that tunnel more than me.
Spike,I love syphilis more than you.
Giles,"Oh, good morning."
Buffy,"Giles, I didn't know you were here."
Giles,Uh really.
Giles,I'm sincerely relieved to hear that. Now can we discuss the impending disaster.
Willow,Giles found something.
Giles,A text. It refers to the gem of amara as residing in the valley of the sun.
Willow,Demon fancy talk for Sunnydale.
Giles,I'll get started.
Willow,I'll go call Xander and have him meet at your place.
Giles,(As he leaves) Right.
Buffy,"Yeah, it happened."
Buffy,It was nice. It was really nice. He's going to call.
Buffy,I don't know. I guess I do.
Spike,It's here.
Vampire,I knew it was here.
Harmony,I don't know why I let you be so mean to me.
Spike,Love hurts baby.
Spike,It's real.
Harmony,"Ooh, pretty. Can I take stuff?"
Spike,Take whatever you want I don't care.
Harmony,Eww. Like you're too good to work a clasp.
Harmony,I can't believe you just did that.
Spike,Hold on.
Harmony,What are you doing you big freak?
Spike,That's my gem.
Spike,That's a good idea. I think I'll go wait outside.
Oz,"Okay, either I'm borrowing all your albums or I'm moving in."
Giles,Oz there are more important things than records right now.
Oz,(Holding up a record.) More important than this one?
Giles,Well I suppose an argument could be made for -
Xander,"Whoa, Giles has a TV. Everybody, Giles has a TV. He's shallow like us."
Oz,"I got to admit, I'm a little disappointed."
Giles,"I, ah, uh, uh."
Willow,(Walking in.) Well maybe it doesn't work. Like a piece of art.
Giles,"Tunneling. Spike. Xander, find Buffy and meet us there."
Buffy,Parker?
Parker,"Buffy. Buffy Summers, this is Katie Loomis. (Katie waves.)"
Buffy,What's going on?
Parker,"Hey, Katie, you're going to be late for class. I'll catch up later, okay."
Buffy,She's a friend of yours.
Parker,"Yeah, you'd like her a bunch. So, what's up?"
Parker,It's only been a few days. You need to talk to me about something.
Buffy,Is everything okay?
Parker,Sure it is.
Buffy,It is?
Parker,Sure.
Parker,"Sure, we could do that absolutely."
Buffy,So what about tonight.
Parker,Oh... Uh... I think I'm supposed to get together with some people later ...
Buffy,Parker did I do something wrong?
Buffy,You had fun? Was that all it was?
Parker,What else was it supposed to be?
Buffy,It seemed like you liked me.
Buffy,I just thought...
Parker,I'm sorry if you missed something. I thought things were pretty clear.
Buffy,I'm sorry if I miss. I'm sorry.
Parker,"Look, I really have to go now."
Buffy,Parker wait. I did this all wrong.
Parker,"No, it's cool. We'll hook up later."
Spike,Wow. That was pathetic.
Spike,"Oh, do it again. It tickels. You know, in a good way."
Spike,The gem of amara.
Spike,"Official sponsor, of my killing you."
Harmony,Being a vampire sucks.
Xander,Buffy. (Knocks again.) Buffy.
Anya,Xander. I was looking for you. You weren't in your musty basement.
Xander,Have you seen Buffy.
Anya,No. About what happened. I said I was over you -
Xander,"Anya, I don't have time."
Giles,"Harmony, where's Spike? Has he had the gem."
Giles,Where did Spike go?
Spike,Getting tired Slayer?
Buffy,"Xander, get out of here."
Buffy,You're a pig Spike.
Spike,"Take it off me this way, we both burn."
Buffy,Really? Let's see.
Willow,I like it.
Oz,It's small.
Xander,Really worth getting my ribs bashed in.
Giles,It's also very dangerous. And we're destroying it.
Buffy,We don't destroy it.
Oz,I have that gig in LA. I could swing by.
Buffy,Thanks Oz.
Xander,What's going on. What's in LA?
Willow,She's giving the ring to Angel. Don't make a fuss.
Giles,Buffy are you sure.
Buffy,He should have it.
Willow,Well maybe you made a mistake. But that's okay. Next time - what?
Buffy,Parker said it's okay to make mistakes. It was sweet.
Willow,I'm your friend. I would call you repulsive in a second.
Willow,I think you're missing something about this whole poop head principal.
Buffy,I think I'm gonna take a walk. You go on ahead.
Willow,You sure?
Buffy,Yeah.
