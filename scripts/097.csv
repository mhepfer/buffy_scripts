GILES VOICEOVER,Previously on <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</I>...
BUFFY VOICEOVER,Tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
QUENTIN TRAVERS VOICEOVER,"Glory isn't a demon, she's a god."
MONK,We had to hide the key ... made it human...
MONK,...and sent it to you.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,Dawn.
DAWN,I'm not real.
BEN,"You're the key. Go. Before she finds you, she's here!"
BEN,I won't help her find the key. I would never do that to an innocent-
JINX,An innocent?
BEN,It's not a person.
GLORY,What about the key?
JINX,He indicated that it was a person.
SPIKE,I'll tell you who the sodding key is.
GLORY,The vampire is lying to me.
SPIKE,The Slayer is going to kick your lopsided ass.
BUFFY,Professor Lillian?
PROFESSOR,Buffy.
BUFFY,I'm sorry that I missed the lecture today. (professor continues struggling with the slide machine) Was it good?
BUFFY,"Um, of course it was. (He returns to fiddling) D-do you want me to try?"
PROFESSOR,"Yes, thanks, the ... (gesturing vaguely) slide is stuck in the ... thing."
BUFFY,"Okay. (begins pulling at the slide) Um, I just ... came by to tell you that ... I have to drop this class. Um, all my classes actually. I'm not finishing the semester. I wish it ... um ... I just, I can't be in school right now. I, I have to take care of my sister."
PROFESSOR,"(nods) Yes, I, I thought you might. I was very sorry to hear about your loss."
BUFFY,"Um, I have these forms from the registrar's office that I need you to sign."
PROFESSOR,Oh ... yes.
BUFFY,Thanks.
PROFESSOR,Is there something else?
BUFFY,"No. Yes. Yeah. Um ... I wanted to tell you ... how much I enjoyed this class. (resumes pulling at the slide projector) I mean, I know that I wasn't the best student, but ... I really learned a lot. Uh, and I really like poetry. (shot of her hands on the projector) I really do."
BUFFY,"(embarrassed) Oh, sorry."
PROFESSOR,"(smiles) I'm glad you like poetry, Buffy."
BUFFY,I wish I had time for it. But I just ... don't right now.
PROFESSOR,"Well, maybe short poems."
BUFFY,"Yeah! Like, like those, those Japanese ones that, that, um, sound like a sneeze?"
PROFESSOR,Haiku?
BUFFY,Right. Maybe those. A-and hopefully I'll be back next semester.
BUFFY VOICEOVER,When I'm more myself again.
DOCTOR,Benjamin. This is a pleasant surprise.
BEN,I'm sorry I'm late.
DOCTOR,You're not late.
BEN,(looks at his watch) But sir-
DOCTOR,"You can't be late to a job that you don't have. (gives the clipboard to the other doctor who walks away) Interestingly enough, I've decided to give your job to someone who'll actually do it. (Ben sighs in annoyance) Honest to God, Ben! I've been calling you for two weeks. Where the hell have you been? I didn't wanna ... I'm sorry to fire you, but I need somebody I can count on."
BEN,(surprised) I haven't been here... (resigned) I haven't been here in two weeks. (hopefully) There's an explanation for this. Which ... I ... can't exactly give you. I - can I just tell you it's not my fault?
DOCTOR,"(nods) Sure. You can also tell me that the dog ate your homework, or maybe eating Twinkies made you do it, or ... maybe yeah, that there's really a wicked demonic creature living inside you that takes control of your body and forces you to do its bidding. (sighs) Take responsibility for your actions, Ben!"
BEN,"I ... this ... (angrily) you know, forget it. Just forget it."
BEN,"This is so unfair. You're taking everything away from me. Everything I worked for, I earned, I care about. These are my choices, this is my life, and you're ruining it! (pauses, shakes his head) No. No. Not here. Not now, please. (puts his hands to his face) I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben."
GLORY,I'm hungry.
GLORY,"(happy sigh) We got this part right, that's for sure. Lot of sucky things in this dimension -- bubble baths? Not one of 'em. (blows some bubbles) Know what I mean?"
JINX,"I am in thunderous agreement, oh glittering, glistening Glorificus."
GLORY,I wasn't talking to you.
MURK,"Uh, begging your pardon, and begging in general, but ... were you talking to me?"
GLORY,"Eww. Yeah, right. Like any of you have ever bathed, anyway."
MURK,"Oh, but we do, your scrumptiousness. We bathe in your splendiforous radiance, your aromatic-"
GLORY,"How about you shut up and listen to me, you disgusting little fools? (all three bow their heads) Okay. Now, I asked for the key, and you brought me a vampire. A pulseless, impure, follicly-fried vampire. Loofah!"
GLORY,"So, what I think we have here is a failure for you to do your frickin' jobs, pardon my French. (shoves the loofah back into Murk's hand) Mimosa."
GLORY,"Mmm ... (sips, smiles) Vitamins. (briskly) So I think you better rack your little minion brains, and tell me everything that you saw when you were spying on Buffy and her wacky pals. Everything. Mm. Then I'll figure out who the key is."
BUFFY VOICEOVER,You lied to me?
DAWN,Didn't ... lie ... e-exactly.
BUFFY,(OS) Really.
BUFFY,"What about all the times I asked you how school was and you said ""fine""?"
DAWN,"Well, it was! (softly) You didn't ask if I was in it when it was fine."
BUFFY,"I-I don't know what to say. I-I'm sure you're aware that the past few months, you know, have been kind of hard for Dawn. Not that I'm saying that's an excuse."
PRINCIPAL,I understand. Your mother was a lovely woman and we'll all miss her very much. I know how difficult it must be.
BUFFY,It is. Especially for Dawn. She-she's just a kid.
PRINCIPAL,"Well ... I think we both know that Dawn is a lot more than ""just a kid."""
PRINCIPAL,(leans forward) She's a talented young girl ... with a sharp mind ... (to Dawn) when she puts the effort in.
BUFFY,"Look. I realize that there's been some ball-dropping, but I'm sure this will all-"
PRINCIPAL,"Dawn, why don't you wait outside for a few minutes?"
Cut to,"interior magic shop, day. Xander and Willow sit at the table, he's reading a comic book and she's reading something else. In the background there's an older couple walking around browsing. The camera pans around to reveal Anya on the other side of the table, standing, watching the customers."
XANDER,Honey.
XANDER,"Old saying. ""A watched customer never buys."""
ANYA,They would if they were patriotic.
XANDER,"(to Willow) Okay, I'm goin' in. (to Anya) Patriotic?"
ANYA,Yes. I've recently come to realize there's more to me than just being human. (proudly) I'm also an American.
GILES,"Yes, I suppose you are, in a manner of speaking. You were born here -- your mortal self."
ANYA,"Well, that's right, foreigner. (Giles gives her a look) So I've been reading a lot about the good ol' us of A (she says ""us"" not ""U.S.""), embracing the extraordinarily precious ideology that's helped to shape and define it."
WILLOW,Democracy?
ANYA,"Capitalism. The free market depends on the profitable exchange of goods for currency. (Xander and Willow exchange an amused look) It's a system of symbiotic beauty apparently lost on these old people. (turns to look back at the customers) Look at 'em. Perusing the shelves. Undressing the merchandise with their eyeballs (turns back to the others) all ogle, no cash. It's not just annoying, it's unAmerican."
GILES,Appalling. Almost as if they no longer think money can buy happiness.
ANYA,"Totally unAmerican. Oh, and you know what else is unAmerican? French people."
WILLOW,You don't say.
ANYA,"From what I hear, they don't tip. Now, French old people? That's *really* the bottom of the barrel, you know?"
XANDER,"Ahn, how's about we try being a bit less prejudiced, and a bit more inclusive? Not us, (indicates himself and Willow, then points to Anya) just you."
ANYA,Fine. I'm gonna make those fogeys buy things.
XANDER,"Hey, what's up? It's Dawn Giovanni and the Buffster."
DAWN,(sullen) Hi.
BUFFY,Hey everybody.
GILES,I trust everything went well at the university?
BUFFY,"Yep, I'm, uh, all dropped out. (she and Dawn sit at the table)"
XANDER,Good on you. Welcome to the real world. Lot of fun to be had on the outside. (looks at Willow) You'll see.
BUFFY,"Well, it's just for now. I mean, I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna go back next semester."
XANDER,"And that's cool too. Whatever you choose, you've got my support. Just think of me as ... (nervous laugh) as your ... (frowns; Buffy looks curiously at him) You know, I'm searching for supportive things, and I'm comin' up all bras, so... (Buffy smiles) something slightly more manly, think of me as that."
XANDER,(quietly) Seriously. Whatever you need.
BUFFY,"Thank you. Actually, I need to talk to Giles alone for a minute. (Giles looks up from his tea and newspaper)"
XANDER,"(OS) Cool, that's cool."
BUFFY,"(stands) Uh, Dawn, why don't you get started on your homework? Uh, if you need help, (turns to Willow) Will, could you? (Willow nods) Okay."
BUFFY,"I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I mean, she's messing up ... I'm messing up ... it's a mess."
GILES,You're just going to have to put your foot down with her.
BUFFY,I try. It's just ... my foot's not used to being put down. (turns to Giles) I want you to do it. (Giles sighs) You can be the foot-putting-downer.
GILES,"No, Buffy, I don't think I can."
BUFFY,"Please? Pretty please? (desperately) I mean, your foot is way bigger than mine! And you're so much more a grownup than me. Dawn needs an authority figure. A strong guiding hand. She'll listen to you."
GILES,(scoffs) Just like you always have.
BUFFY,I listen!
BUFFY,(pouts) I do.
GILES,"(removes his glasses, sits next to her) Well, then perk up your ears. I may be a grownup, but you're her family. Her only real family now. She needs you to do this."
BUFFY,"(nervous) Right. She needs me. (Giles looks sympathetic) Me, the ... grownup. (more confidently) The authority figure. The, the strong guiding hand and, and stompy foot that is me."
GILES,That's the spirit.
BUFFY,(small smile) Okay. (nods) I can do this. (gets up)
GILES,(gets up) I know you can.
BUFFY,Please?
GILES,No.
BUFFY,Okay. (Giles nods) Here we go.
BUFFY,"(reciting) Early to bed, early to rise, balanced breakfast, hospital corners. It's a new beginning."
BUFFY,Discipline. Authority. Order.
BUFFY,(storms forward) What is this? I thought I told you to do your homework!
DAWN,I was.
BUFFY,(folds her arms) Please don't lie to me.
DAWN,I'm not.
WILLOW,"We were acting out a geometry problem, 'cause I read this really neat article that said kids learn math better if you, you stimulate their, uh, visual learning pattern. You know, using the right side of the brain instead of just the left?"
WILLOW,(OS) Stuff like that.
BUFFY,Uh-huh.
WILLOW,"So we made a triangle with our bodies, and that's when I called Xander obtuse, and he got really grumpy (smiling; Dawn giggles) and then Dawn said we were ""acute"" triangle, and, well, hilarity ensued."
BUFFY,"Right. Well, you know what I think? I think maybe Dawn should do her homework at home."
DAWN,B-but it was working. I was really learning.
BUFFY,Please get your stuff.
DAWN,Fine. Don't listen to me. (goes to get her stuff)
WILLOW,(walking over to Buffy) Please don't be grouchy with her. Who among us can resist the allure of really funny math puns?
BUFFY,It's really important that Dawn finishes her schoolwork right now.
WILLOW,"(OS) Yeah, I know, but..."
WILLOW,"We were having good clean educational fun, and then all of a sudden it was all gloom and doom and the outlawing of human triangles."
BUFFY,(firmly) It's *really* important that Dawn finishes her schoolwork right now.
WILLOW,"I know it is, and I'm a big fan of school. You know me! I'm like, (sings) ""Go school! It's your birthday!"" Or something to that effect."
BUFFY,"Look, Willow, I know that you mean well, but you just don't understand, and there's no way that you could."
WILLOW,"I do so understand, it ... you're stressed out."
BUFFY,I'm more than stressed out. I'm freaked out.
WILLOW,"Yeah, well, maybe you need a break to de-freak. Hey, you could go to the World's Culture fair if you want to, with me and Tara."
BUFFY,(quietly) I don't think so.
WILLOW,"Come on. You can bring Dawn. It'll be fun. Good, educational-type fun in a discipline-y sort of way."
BUFFY,"I can't do it, Will. Don't worry. It's not like I don't have a life. I do. I have Dawn's life."
BUFFY,Ready?
Cut to,close shot of Glory in her apartment.
GLORY,"So it's her. Under our noses all this time. I like the detail work those monks did. (smiling) Quirks, foibles, passions ... it's all so cute, so ... human. You know?"
GLORY,Pretty convincing really. (ponders) But not convincing enough.
GLORY,You all know your assignments. (smiles widely) I think it's time to collect the key.
WILLOW,It wasn't anything really. Buffy was just a little crabby at Dawn about her schoolwork.
TARA,"Well, it's understandable. (puts something on the bed, turns back to close the closet door)"
WILLOW,"Yeah, sure it is. I'd totally be blowing off classes if I were in Dawnie's shoes."
TARA,"(smiles) Sweetie, you wouldn't blow off a class if your head was on fire. (goes over to the sink) And, I meant Buffy."
WILLOW,(putting on earrings) Buffy what?
TARA,Understandable about the crabby. She has to look after Dawn now.
WILLOW,"(putting on a jacket) Yeah, but not in a Miss Minchin's Select Seminary For Girls way. I mean, she's just gonna make Dawnie more rebellious."
TARA,"I had to deal with my brother's problems after ... I mean, you can't really know what it's like to-"
WILLOW,"Yeah, I know that."
TARA,"I, I didn't mean to-"
WILLOW,"No, I just ... I ... I know I can't know what you went through. (Tara frowns) But I just ... (fake laugh) It's no big."
TARA,I made you mad.
WILLOW,No. No.
TARA,All I meant was-
WILLOW,"No, it's okay. This whole Buffy thing, let's just forget it."
TARA,"No, please. I mean, I mean, tell me if I said something wrong, otherwise I know I'll say it again. Probably often and in public."
WILLOW,"No, I was snippy gal. It's just ... I know I can't ... on some level ... (sighs) it's like my opinion isn't worth anything because I haven't been through ... (sighs) I didn't lose my mom, so I don't know."
TARA,"Well ... I-I'm not the expert. I mean, I've only lost the one."
TARA,(uncertainly) Do ... I act like ... the big knowledge woman?
WILLOW,(weakly) No.
TARA,Is that no spelled Y-E-S?
WILLOW,"S-O-R-T of. (Tara frowns) I mean, I just feel like the-the junior partner. You've been doing everything longer than me. You've been out longer ... you've been practicing witchcraft way longer."
TARA,"Oh, but you're way beyond me there! In just a few- I mean ... it frightens me how powerful you're getting."
WILLOW,(frowns) That's a weird word.
TARA,"(nervous smile) ""Getting""?"
WILLOW,It frightens you? *I* frighten you?
TARA,(jumps up from the bed) That is *so* not what I meant. I meant i-impresses - impressive.
WILLOW,"Well, I took Psych 101. I mean, I took it from an evil government scientist who was skewered by her Frankenstein-like creation before the final, but I know what a Freudian slip is."
WILLOW,D-don't you trust me?
TARA,With my life.
WILLOW,That's not what I mean.
TARA,Can't we just go to the fair?
WILLOW,I don't feel real multicultural right now. (stands up) Wh ... what is it about me that you don't trust?
TARA,"It's not that. I worry, sometimes. You're, you're changing so much, so fast. I don't know where you're heading."
WILLOW,Where I'm heading?
TARA,I'm saying everything wrong.
WILLOW,"No, I think you're being pretty clear. This isn't about the witchcraft. It's about the other changes in my life."
TARA,I trust you. I just ... (looks down) I don't know where I'm gonna fit in ... in your life when...
WILLOW,"When ... I change back? Yeah, this is a college thing, just a, a little experimentation before I get over the thrill and head back to boys' town."
WILLOW,You think that?
TARA,Should I?
WILLOW,"I'm really sorry that I didn't establish my lesbo street cred before I got into this relationship. You're the only woman I've ever fallen in love with, so ... how on earth could you ever take me seriously?"
TARA,"Willow, please!"
WILLOW,Have fun at the fair.
Cut to,"exterior Summers house, day. A couple of Glory's demons walk up the front porch, over to the side window, kneel down and look in the window. Inside we see the living room. Dawn is sitting at the table while Buffy stands."
BUFFY,"Okay, so, I-I think the next step is to make a chart. A schedule. (Dawn gives her an angry look) I'll write down all the things you're supposed to do, and when you have to do them, and then I'll leave a box next to it, which you can mark with an X when you've accomplished the task."
BUFFY,What? You want gold stars? (rolls her eyes) Okay. You can have gold stars.
DAWN,I don't want gold stars. (scoffs) I don't want any of this.
BUFFY,I'm just trying to give you a normal life.
DAWN,"(sarcastic) Well, good luck."
DAWN,"What? (rolls eyes, sits back) What am I doing wrong now?"
BUFFY,"This is for real, Dawn."
DAWN,"No, it's not. I'm not real, so why would my exciting graph of chores be real? Who cares if a key gets an education anyway? (slams her textbook shut, folds her arms again)"
BUFFY,It's a chart. Not a graph. And you are real.
DAWN,Yeah? Those monks put grades K through eight in my head. Can't we just wait and see if they drop nine in there too?
BUFFY,"Damn it, Dawn. This is serious."
DAWN,Why? Why should I care about any of this?
BUFFY,Because they'll take you away!
DAWN,Take me away? What do you mean?
BUFFY,"(softly) They'll take you away from me. That's what your principal told me when you weren't in the room. If I can't make you go to school, then I won't be found fit to be your legal guardian."
DAWN,Where would I go?
BUFFY,"(softly) I don't know. Dad maybe ... or foster care ... I, I didn't really want to ask."
DAWN,"(pause, scoffs) You could've told me that."
BUFFY,I just did.
Cut to,"magic shop. Giles walks over to the counter carrying two cups of tea, goes behind the counter where Anya is doing paperwork, gives her a mug. Pan across to a corner where Willow sits on the floor, beside a bookcase, amongst a pile of cushions, looking sad. Sad music continues."
GLORY,Is this seat taken?
GILES,I hope this isn't a return. Everyone wants petrified hamsters and they're never happy with them.
GILES,You all right?
WILLOW,Yeah.
GILES,"Ah yes, because your good mood is both obvious and contagious."
WILLOW,I had a fight with Tara. It was awful.
GILES,"Oh, I'm sorry. (takes the box and walks toward the shelves behind the counter)"
WILLOW,(OS) Me too.
GILES,"You two don't quarrel much, do you?"
WILLOW,Never. Until today.
GILES,"Well, now it's over."
WILLOW,(very upset) Over? How can it be over? I just found her!
GILES,The quarrel is over.
WILLOW,(quieter) Oh. Yeah.
GILES,"Uh, you'll feel better when you've made your apologies and you'll know that you can fight without the world ending. (walks toward the rear door) I know it all seems bleak now, but as they say, this too..."
GILES,...shall pass.
Cut to,"Giles holding the demon by the ear, dragging him into the shop and throwing him into a chair. Willow and Anya rush over."
ANYA,Wow!
GILES,"Now, what do we have here?"
ANYA,"Oh, he's one of those things that work for Glory!"
GILES,Yes. How helpful.
SLOOK,I do indeed work for the god. Let me go if you do not wish to incur her anger.
GILES,"Well, she's not here. What a marvelous opportunity for you and me to talk."
SLOOK,"I will not betray Glorificus. I will never talk, no matter what heinous torture-"
GILES,"Actually, you're talking quite a lot, just not about the right things. Tell us why you're here."
SLOOK,No words shall pass my lips that will bring peril to Glorificus.
GILES,"Girls, get the twine that's on the counter, let's tie him up."
SLOOK,"No, no! I'll tell you! Anything! Please! Whatever you want! Just, I'll, anything!"
ANYA,What happened?
GILES,He changed his mind.
SLOOK,I'm ... I'm supposed to watch. We're watching the Slayer's people ... while Glory fetches the key.
WILLOW,Glory knows who the key is?
GILES,Oh god. (removes his glasses)
ANYA,We've got to call Buffy.
SLOOK,"Too late. Too late. Glorificus will find the witch, and there's nothing you can do to stop her."
ANYA,Witch? What do you mean?
WILLOW,(horrified) Tara!
SLOOK,She's the new one among you. It wasn't hard to figure out. The glorious one will have found her by now.
GILES,"(yells) Willow, wait! I'll go with-"
WILLOW,"No! Call Buffy a-and go look in Tara's room, I'm gonna check the fair."
GLORY,"Oh, this is nice. Just hangin' out, just us girls. You like that sort of thing, don't you?"
TARA,Aah...
GLORY,Don't ... make a sound.
GLORY,Nah. They won't help you. I'd kill them. You know that.
GLORY,There's no one here that can stop me.
GLORY,"I'll kill her (shot of a random woman) and ... and them (shot of a random couple) I'll kill him, and her and her, (laughs) and it'll all be your fault."
GLORY,"Kinda funny, isn't it? All these people here and ... no one who can do a thing. Not a person who can help you."
GLORY,"But that's people for ya. They're pretty worthless. (watches some people go by) But keys, on the other hand ... keys are worth a very lot."
GLORY,"You lying little tramp! You're not the key, you're nothing! Just another worthless human being!"
TARA,I didn't-
GLORY,I hate being lied to. It makes me feel so betrayed. (considers) Hey! (turns back to Tara) You wanna make it all better?
GLORY,If you tell me who the key really is ... I'll let you go.
GLORY,Think about it. You think your hand hurts? Imagine what you'd feel with my fingers wiggling in your brain. (Tara looks very scared) It doesn't kill you. What it does ... is make you feel like you're in a noisy little dark room ... (Glory frowns and fidgets uncomfortably) naked and ashamed ... and there are things in the dark that need to hurt you because you're bad ... little pinching things that go in your ears ... (Tara begins to cry) and crawl on the inside of your skull. And you know ... that if the noise and the crawling would stop ... that you could remember how to get out.
GLORY,"But you never, ever will."
GLORY,Who ... is ... the key?
GLORY,Fine. Let's get crazy.
WILLOW,(OS) Tara!
WILLOW,Tara!
WILLOW,"By force of heart and mindful power, by waning time and waxing hour ..."
WILLOW,"I echo Diana, um, when I decree ... uh, what is it, what is it?"
WILLOW,No! No!
WILLOW,That she I love must now be free!
WILLOW,Tara!
WILLOW,No!!
WILLOW,"Tara, Tara, are you okay?"
TARA,It's dirty. It's all dirty. And all over me!
TARA,Dirty. Dirty. I'm bad. Bad. (whimpering)
WILLOW,"(crying) Tara. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."
Cut to,"interior hospital. Giles is looking at some X-rays of a hand that are posted on the wall. He removes his glasses and wipes his eyes as he turns and the camera pans across to reveal Anya and Xander, then Tara sitting on the edge of an exam table wearing a hospital gown. She looks straight ahead with a glazed expression. Her hand is bandaged. We see Willow sitting beside her."
WILLOW,Can she go home now?
DOCTOR,"Unfortunately, no. Hospital policy dictates we keep her for the night."
WILLOW,But does she have to? I-I can take care of her at home.
TARA,"It's poisoned. (to Willow, matter-of-factly) Why don't I tell you that? It, it has to be checked, though."
DOCTOR,She your sister?
TARA,"I-i-it has to be verified, of course. Anyone can tell you that. Of course. (looking from one person to the next) Of course, of course."
WILLOW,(staring at Tara) She's my everything.
DOCTOR,"Well, you can get her released first thing in the morning. But she's gotta spend one night in the psych ward. Just for observation. We'll keep an eye on her, do a couple basic tests, then you can take her home. Does that sound fair? (Willow nods uncertainly) Well, sit tight then, and I'll send a nurse by in a few minutes to pick up Tara."
XANDER,"Man, words cannot express how much I hate this place."
GILES,It's dreadful.
ANYA,It's like communism.
BUFFY,"Hey. Will, I'm so sorry."
TARA,They kill mice.
BUFFY,Tara.
BUFFY,"I'm sorry it took me so long, but Dawn's safe with Spike, so I-I can stay as long as you need."
WILLOW,(to Buffy) I'm so scared.
SPIKE VOICEOVER,"Nothin' to be worried about, kid."
SPIKE,No one's gonna hurt you.
DAWN,Oh yeah? Same no one who did that to you?
SPIKE,"What, these? It's just a few bruises."
SPIKE,Nothin' to write home about.
SPIKE,"Hey, chin up, platelet. Don't get scared. Maybe Glory doesn't wanna kill you, maybe it's something-"
DAWN,Worse?
SPIKE,Hey.
DAWN,"You wanna know what I'm scared of, Spike? ... Me. (tearfully) Right now, Glory thinks Tara's the key. But I'm the key, Spike. I am. And anything that happens to Tara ... is 'cause of me. Your bruises, your limp ... that's all me too. I'm like a lightning rod for pain and hurt. (crying) And everyone around me suffers and dies. I ... must be something so horrible ... to cause so much pain ... and evil."
SPIKE,(firmly) Rot.
DAWN,(teary) What do you know?
SPIKE,I'm a vampire. I know somethin' about evil. You're not evil.
DAWN,Maybe ... I'm not evil. But I don't think I can be good. (looks up at Spike with a hopeful expression)
SPIKE,"(considers) Well, I'm not good, and I'm okay."
TARA,(upset) Don't! Please don't with that treachery!
TARA,I told the cat. And now I beg my mother sitting all alone.
WILLOW,"Bye, Tara. I'll see you tomorrow. I love you."
XANDER,Willow. No. It's just for one night. (We see Buffy in the background leaning against the wall)
WILLOW,"Yeah, I-I know, but ... it's a whole night. I don't think I can sleep without her."
ANYA,You can sleep with me.
ANYA,"Well, now that came out a lot more lesbian than it sounded in my head."
BUFFY,"(comes forward) Will, you just have to rest. Okay? Right now there's nothing you can do."
WILLOW,(ponders) Yes there is. (walks out the door)
BUFFY,No. No way.
BUFFY,You cannot even think about taking on Glory.
WILLOW,You saw what she did to Tara. I can't let her get away with it.
BUFFY,"No. You *have* to let her get away with it. Even I'm no match for her, you know that."
WILLOW,But maybe I am.
BUFFY,You're not. And I won't let you go.
WILLOW,This is not your choice. It's mine.
BUFFY,This is not the time.
WILLOW,"When, Buffy? When is? When *you* feel like it? When it's someone *you* love as much as I love Tara? When it's Dawn, is that it?"
BUFFY,"When we have a chance. We'll fight her, when we have a chance. You wouldn't last five minutes with her, Willow. She's a god."
WILLOW,(shakes her head sadly) Fine. I'll wait.
BUFFY,It's the only way.
WILLOW,(skeptical) Yeah.
BUFFY,Can I do anything?
WILLOW,(not turning back) Just let me be alone.
Cut to,"interior magic shop. Willow bursts in at a run. She runs straight to the stairs that lead up to the loft where the more dangerous stuff is kept. She goes up the stairs, takes a small black leather back from the top of a bookshelf, kneels, and begins pulling stuff off the shelves. She opens a drawer and takes out a jeweled dagger, puts it in the bag. She pulls books and vials off the shelves and puts them in the bag. She shoves books off the shelves every which way, finally pulls out one very large old book and puts it on the floor in front of her."
GLORY,"You know, I think I'm a little buzzed from eating that witch! What a mind she has. Mmm, nummy treat."
JINX,Is your grace not the slightest bit concerned about-
GLORY,"What, about the Slayer? Don't be stupid. I know I'm closing in. The key's as good as mine. (the demons all smile) Girl like Buffy's got just so many friends. All I gotta do it rip through 'em one by one until I finally..."
GLORY,Did anybody order an apocalypse?
WILLOW,"Kali, Hera, Kronos, Tonic..."
WILLOW,"Air like nectar, thick as onyx..."
WILLOW,Cassiel by your second star...
GLORY,Uhh. It's the lover. (walks forward) That's so cute.
WILLOW,Hold mine victim as in tar.
WILLOW,I ... owe ... you ... pain!
Cut to,Buffy and Dawn sitting together in Spike's cavern. Spike stands a little ways off.
DAWN,It's all my fault.
BUFFY,"No. (brushes Dawn's hair back) Sweetheart, it is *not* your fault."
DAWN,(teary) How's Willow?
BUFFY,(continues stroking Dawn's hair) She was looking to go all payback-y on Glory for a minute. But I cooled her down a little. Actually a lot.
SPIKE,So she's not gonna do anything rash then.
BUFFY,No. I explained that there was no point.
SPIKE,(walks a little closer) Mm-hmm.
BUFFY,What?
SPIKE,"You - so you're saying that a ... powerful and mightily pissed-off witch ... was plannin' on going and spillin' herself a few pints of god blood until you, what, ""explained""?"
BUFFY,You think she'd ... no. I told Willow it would be like suicide.
SPIKE,I'd do it.
SPIKE,(looks down at the ground) Right person. Person I loved. (looks at Buffy) I'd do it.
DAWN,"Think, Buffy. If Glory had done that to me."
WILLOW,Shatter.
GLORY,"Is that it? Is that the best you can do? You think I care about all this, the apartment, the clothes?"
GLORY,"Now, sucking on your girlfriend's mind?"
GLORY,That was something to treasure.
GLORY,(amused) What's this? Bag of tricks?
WILLOW,Bag of knives.
WILLOW,Spirit of serpents now appear.
WILLOW,"Hissing, writhing, striking near."
GLORY,Now this is getting weak.
GLORY,"And so are you, honey. Aren't ya?"
WILLOW,No!
GLORY,"Know what they used to do to witches, lover? (brings up her other hand with the dagger) Crucify 'em."
BUFFY,They used to bow down to gods.
BUFFY,Things change.
GLORY,That witch barely slowed me down.
WILLOW,(over her shoulder) Thicken.
GLORY,"(shouting) This isn't over, you hear me? It isn't over!"
Cut to,"exterior dorm building, day."
BUFFY,Chicken salad?
WILLOW,Right here.
BUFFY,"Eggplant, that's me ... salami with ... (looks at the sandwich) ew, peanut butter? Dawn. (gives it to Dawn)"
DAWN,"Yeah, like eggplant is normal. It's what, half egg, half plant? 'Cause that's just unnatural."
WILLOW,What's Tara got?
DAWN,Oh. (holds out a sandwich) I ... got her tuna. Does she like...?
DAWN,(gently) Tara?
TARA,Plastic and their six sisters. Six sick sisters. (anxiously) Willow?
WILLOW,"It's okay. Let's just start slow today. Um, Buffy, could I have that?"
WILLOW,Here you go.
WILLOW,That's my girl.
DAWN,Can I help?
BUFFY,What are you gonna need?
WILLOW,I don't know. They gave me a lot of stuff to ... keep her calm.
WILLOW,"(quietly) They said I might have to restrain her at night. But ... sometimes she's fine. She looks at me, and ... she's fine."
BUFFY,I'm sorry I couldn't-
WILLOW,It's okay. I can do this. I'm gonna take care of her. Even if she never...
WILLOW,(softly) She's my girl.
BUFFY,I understand.
WILLOW,(nods) I know you do.
WILLOW,"(to Tara) Hear that, baby? (Tara looks at her) You're my always."
GLORY,I told you this wasn't over.
TARA,"No. The place is cracking! It's cracking! Cracking, no, no, no!"
DAWN,"No, Tara, it's okay."
TARA,"(gasping, staring at Dawn) Oh, look at that, look at that. The light!"
TARA,"Oh, it's so pure! Such pure green energy!"
TARA,"(still staring at Dawn) Oh, it's so beautiful."
Executive Producer,Joss Whedon.
