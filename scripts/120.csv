"<blockquote>GILES VOICEOVER",Previously on <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>...
SPIKE,Why won't you sleep with me again?
BUFFY,Because I don't love you.
WILLOW,See? Clothes.
TARA,Better not get used to 'em.
WILLOW,Yes ma'am.
WARREN,"Say goodnight, bitch."
BUFFY,"Goodnight, bitch."
SPIKE,I'm gonna make you feel it!
BUFFY,Stop!
BUFFY,Ask me again why I could never love you.
SPIKE,"Get nice and comfy, Slayer. I'll be back. And when I do ... things are gonna change."
WARREN,You think you can just do that to me? You think I'd let you get away with that? Think again.
WILLOW,Tara?!
WILLOW,Tara! Baby!
XANDER,Buffy!
XANDER,(OS) She's in the back.
XANDER,This way!
PARAMEDIC 1,She was shot?
XANDER,"Yeah, in the chest."
PARAMEDIC #2,Accidental?
XANDER,"No no, it was a ... He was trying to kill her."
Cut to,"close shot on Tara still lying in Willow's lap. Sound of Willow crying and breathing heavily. Willow's arms have blood on them, as does her shirt. She gently shakes Tara."
WILLOW,"(crying) Oh god, oh no. Please, please, come on.... (crying)"
WILLOW,"Come on, Tara! Please, come on, baby..."
WILLOW,"By Osiris, I command you, bring her back!"
PARAMEDIC #2,Pulse is 100 and weak. Lung sounds are wet.
XANDER,What does that mean? Is she going to...
PARAMEDIC #1,"You need to stand back, okay? If you want us to help her out, we need some space."
WILLOW,Hear me! Keeper of darkness!
DEMON,Witch! How dare you invoke Osiris in this task!
WILLOW,"(crying) Please. Please, bring her back."
DEMON,You may not violate the laws of natural passing.
WILLOW,How? How is this natural?
DEMON,"It is a human death, by human means."
WILLOW,But I-
DEMON,You raised one killed by mystical forces. This is not the same. She is taken by natural order. It is done.
WILLOW,(crying) No. There has to be a way.
DEMON,It is done.
WILLOW,(screams) NOOOO!
PARAMEDIC #2,"(into walkie-talkie) Sunnydale Memorial, do you copy? We have a caucasian female, 21, GSW to the chest."
XANDER,"Come on, Buff, hang on. We're going to get you to the hospital."
XANDER,"Willow, god, are you okay?"
WILLOW,(quietly) How did this happen?
XANDER,Warren. He had a gun.
WILLOW,"(with a brief flash of anger, then blank again) Warren."
XANDER,"It went down too fast, I couldn't stop him."
XANDER,Hey.
XANDER,Will!
PARAMEDIC #1,"Sir, we have to go, are you coming with us or not?"
Cut to,exterior shot of the Sunnydale police station.
Cut to,a holding cell. It's dark despite being daylight outside. Andrew lies on his back on the top bunk.
ANDREW,Think they'll let my aunt bring me my Discman?
JONATHAN,That's what you're worried about? In-flight entertainment? We're in jail!
ANDREW,We're in custody. We haven't been charged yet. (rolling over onto his stomach)
JONATHAN,"Thank you, Dragnet. (walks toward Andrew, angry) It doesn't matter what they call it, they got us, okay? We're going down."
JONATHAN,(quietly) That guy's been looking at me. I think he wants to make me his butt monkey.
ANDREW,(rolling his eyes) Don't flatter yourself. I heard him talking to the guard. He's in here for parking tickets.
JONATHAN,"That doesn't mean anything! The joint changes you. (whispers) I hear they like the small ones, with little hands like their girlfriends."
ANDREW,"You have got to chill out. This isn't Oz, it's like, Mayberry. Besides, Warren is going to find a way to get us out of here."
JONATHAN,(sarcastic) Yeah. I'm sure he'll be busting us out any minute.
ANDREW,"He will. He's coming up with a plan. Like, ""War Games."" Remember that decoder that Matthew Broderick used?"
JONATHAN,"(smiling) Oh, yeah. That was rad. The one he made from the scissors and the tape recorder?"
ANDREW,"I miss ""Ferris"" Matthew. Broadway Matthew? I find him cold."
JONATHAN,"Really? No, I- (catches himself, exasperated) Shut up!"
JONATHAN,(grimly) This is real life. And nobody's coming to get us. Not even your aunt who won't return your one phone call.
ANDREW,(defensively) She must be out of town.
JONATHAN,"She. Doesn't. Care. And neither does your partner in crime, Warren."
ANDREW,"Don't say that. And what do you mean, my partner in crime? We're in this together."
JONATHAN,"(turns back toward Andrew, angry) What do you mean, what do I mean? You two were totally going to fly off and leave me holding the bag."
ANDREW,No we weren't! I was going to - (lamely) carry you. (rolls over onto his back and stares at the ceiling)
JONATHAN,"No, you two were setting me up, and then Warren was going to screw you over too."
ANDREW,"(rolls over again to face Jonathan, tearful) That is so not true!"
JONATHAN,Sure. (sits on the bottom bunk) He's a nice murderer who keeps his word.
ANDREW,"(softly) You're wrong. He's coming for us. He's out there right now, devising a brilliant way to get us out of here."
Cut to,"interior of an underground bar. Warren comes down the stairs outside and enters, wearing a slick suit and dark sunglasses. He strides toward the bar."
WARREN,"Whiskey, straight up. And get a round for the house. I'm feeling expansive."
WARREN,(friendly greeting) Hey.
WARREN,(leaning toward the vamp) Bet you don't get a lot of humans in-
VAMPIRE,I'm watching my program.
WARREN,Wouldn't want to interrupt your 'me' time. (loudly) Not even to buy the guy who killed the Slayer a drink.
VAMPIRE,What's that?
WARREN,Took her out myself. I've been heading an organization. The Trio? You've heard of us.
VAMPIRE,Uh - (exchanging a look with the demon bartender) ...no.
WARREN,"Not important. I cut them loose. I figure, now that Buffy's out of the picture, some things have got to change around here. (to bartender) I need a real gang, you know, not a, not a couple of wannabes."
BARTENDER,And you killed the Slayer?
WARREN,With these hands.
BARTENDER,"What are you, a warlock?"
WARREN,"It's funny you mention that. You know, I've explored all the dark arts ... witchcraft, demonology. You name it, I tried it against the Slayer. But you know what I found *really* works?"
WARREN,Gun.
VAMPIRE,(small grin) You killed the Slayer with a gun.
WARREN,"In her own backyard. Don't underestimate science, my friend. Good old-fashioned metal meets propulsion."
BARTENDER,"(to vampire) Man, this is gonna be good."
WARREN,"(not getting it) Oh, the best. This town is ours."
VAMPIRE,"Ours, maybe. (everyone stops laughing) You are screwed."
BARTENDER,"Metal meets propulsion, yeah. But you still better be a good shot!"
WARREN,"This isn't the evil laugh of victory, is it."
VAMPIRE,"More like the evil laugh of ""you're a dead man."" (more laughter)"
WARREN,"(totally rattled) Okay, uh ... what, what's the joke?"
BARTENDER,(laughing) It was just on the news. Girl was shot.
VAMPIRE,(grinning) In her back yard.
BARTENDER,She survived. She's in the hospital
BARTENDER,Slayers heal fast. Real fast.
VAMPIRE,"Yeah. I was gonna eat you myself during the commercial, but now I think it'll be more fun to let the Slayer de-gut you."
VAMPIRE,"Might want to get a head start, my friend. 'Cause this girl is gonna be coming for you, big time. (chuckling)"
Cut to,"interior magic shop, day. The door suddenly slams open and Willow appears in the doorway. She marches inside. Lamps and light fixtures explode as she walks past them."
ANYA,Willow.
WILLOW,Where do you keep the black arts books?
ANYA,"Something terrible has happened, I know. But you don't have to do-"
WILLOW,(staring up at the loft bookshelves) I need power.
ANYA,(coming out from behind the counter) Not with those books. I can't let you. Willow!
WILLOW,That's better.
DAWN,(calls) Buffy?
DAWN,Buffy?
DAWN,"Hey. Hello? Uh, (pointing toward downstairs) the door was..."
DAWN,Tara?
RACK,"All right, who's next?"
WARREN,I am.
JUNKIE,Hey.
RACK,You're new.
WARREN,"Yeah. (holds up a large wad of cash) And I come bearing dead presidents, so you think we can just skip the small talk?"
RACK,How'd you find me?
WARREN,I talked to a guy. He's one of your regulars. Offered to show me the way for twenty bucks.
RACK,Should have haggled. Most of my customers'll bring you here for five.
WARREN,"(impatiently) Great, great I'll file that away. Look, I'm in a bit of a situation here. I tried to do us all a favor, and eliminate the Slayer, but it ... I...."
WARREN,I guess it didn't take.
RACK,"(walking closer) Killing a Slayer, that's big business for a kid."
WARREN,I'm not a kid.
RACK,(now in Warren's personal space) Okay.
WARREN,"I had my own guys. The Trio, yeah, you've heard of us."
RACK,"Right. What were you, a band or something?"
WARREN,"I thought word traveled in the underworld. You know, we were evil. Robots were my thing. (Rack looking blank) You didn't hear about the freeze ray?"
RACK,(shakes his head) Sorry. So why aren't your guys helping you?
WARREN,"Look, I thought this was a cash for service gig, not an interview process, all right? I need protection. I've got the Slayer after me."
RACK,(moving away) Slayer is the least of your problems.
WARREN,"You're right. Let's talk about my skin troubles. You know, I'd say on the scale of problems, that she ranks!"
RACK,"If I were you, I'd be worried about the witch."
WARREN,(surprised) Witch? W-which witch?
RACK,"Willow. Slayer's pal? (walking closer again) She's the new power, man, anybody with intuition can feel it. She's going to blow this town apart . (now right in Warren's face) Starting ... with you."
WARREN,"Me? What did I, what did I do to her? O-okay, okay, I, I shot her friend..."
RACK,(painfully) I feel death.
WARREN,But the Slayer's alive. And - and she heals.
RACK,"She might, but somebody's stone cold, and that ... is why the witch wants your head. She can sense your essence right now, man. It's just a matter of time before she finds you."
WARREN,"All right. Take it. All right, there's that, and I can get more. Just give me something."
RACK,Hide or fight?
WARREN,"Both. All of it. I, I still have a few tricks up my sleeve, but it's not enough. I need, I need a cover, and I need lots of fire power."
RACK,I can't guarantee anything. Not this time. (softly) The girl is running on pure fury. I've never felt anything like it. (small grin)
WARREN,"Thank you for the tip, Nostradamus. Just load me up, okay?"
Cut to,"Sunnydale hospital. Xander stands in the hallway looking through a window into another room, anxious. A nurse in full scrubs goes past him, holding a small tray. The camera follows her as she goes around a corner and through a door into the room Xander is watching. We see various medical personnel working on Buffy, talking indistinctly. A machine beeps steadily."
NURSE,...standing by.
DOCTOR,We've got to stop that bleeding.
NURSE #1,Where?
DOCTOR,Over by the left ventricle.
NURSE #2,(looking at monitors) BP is down to 80/palp.
DOCTOR,We got more bleeding.
NURSE #2,BP is...
NURSE #1,What's happening?
WILLOW,Leave.
XANDER,Willow.
WILLOW,"(ignoring him, speaking to the medical staff) Now."
XANDER,"Will, what are you doing?! She's going to die."
WILLOW,No she isn't.
WILLOW,It's so small.
BUFFY,What happened?
XANDER,Buffy!
XANDER,"Oh my god, are you okay?"
BUFFY,(confused) Sure. How'd I get here?
XANDER,"You've got to stop doing this. This dying thing's funny once, maybe twice."
BUFFY,Willow?
WILLOW,(very small smile) Buffy. Hey.
BUFFY,What's wrong?
WILLOW,I'll explain. But we've gotta go.
BUFFY,Why?
WILLOW,(not turning back) It's time to find Warren.
Cut to,a ticket counter somewhere. Indistinct announcements over a loudspeaker. A woman in a uniform hands Warren a ticket folder.
WARREN,This'll get me all the way to the border?
CLERK,You'll have to change to the city bus. It's all in the folder.
Cut to,"a highway, daylight. It's fairly deserted with mostly desert on each side. A single car speeds along."
WILLOW,Faster.
XANDER,I'm going as fast as I-
WILLOW,Faster!
XANDER,"Will, would you cut that out? If you wanted to drive..."
BUFFY,We need to stop. I don't like this.
WILLOW,We're close. I can feel him.
BUFFY,"And we'll catch him, and he'll go to jail. Look, I'm finding the whole getting shot very motivating. But you're using magic."
WILLOW,"If I wasn't, you'd be dead. (Xander looking upset)"
BUFFY,"Maybe. But this isn't right. Okay, this isn't how I want it."
WILLOW,Sometimes you don't have a choice.
XANDER,I think Buffy gets the tie-breaker on this one. She was the one on the ouchy end of the bullet.
BUFFY,"Will, you do have a choice. This isn't good for you."
XANDER,"You made the decision to stop for a reason. You promised us. And can I just ask, what's with the make-over of the damned? I mean, the hair...!"
WILLOW,Turn right! Go!
XANDER,Go - where?
WILLOW,Over there! Now!
XANDER,(looking in confusion) Will.
WILLOW,Turn.
XANDER,"(holding up his hands) Fine, fine! Puppetmaster wants to drive? Go right ahead!"
BUFFY,"Willow, wait!"
WILLOW,Stay back.
WILLOW,Get out.
WARREN,Please. I'll-I'll do anything.
WILLOW,(surprised) It's a robot.
WILLOW,"(confused) I, I could feel his essence."
WILLOW,He tricked me. (starts to walk) We'll find him another way.
BUFFY,(turning to follow) And then what?
WILLOW,And then we'll kill him.
BUFFY,"Okay, you need to calm down."
WILLOW,Calm down?
BUFFY,"Look, you're angry. I, I am too. There's no excuse for what Warren did, but that-"
WILLOW,He shot Tara.
WILLOW,"When he shot you, he hit her too. Upstairs in my room."
BUFFY,Oh my god.
WILLOW,Guess the last shot was the charm.
XANDER,She's dead?
WILLOW,She's dead. Now he's dead too.
BUFFY,(very upset) Oh my god ... (whispers) Tara...
XANDER,"Christ, Will, how come you didn't say anything?"
WILLOW,I'm busy.
BUFFY,"W-Willow, please, just stop."
BUFFY,We love you. And Tara. But we don't kill humans. It's not the way.
WILLOW,How can you say that? Tara is dead.
BUFFY,"I know ... I know. And I ... can't understand ... anything. Not what happened ... a-and not what you must be going through. Willow, if you do this, you let Warren destroy you too."
XANDER,"You said it yourself, Will ... the magic's too strong, there's no coming back from it."
WILLOW,I'm not coming back.
BUFFY,"Will, please. Please, we'll get through this together."
WILLOW,We won't! Not your way.
BUFFY,"Please, just-"
WILLOW,No! No more talking. It's done!
BUFFY,Willow? Dawn?
XANDER,Maybe she went to the hospital to find you.
BUFFY,I left there hours ago. She'd be back by now.
BUFFY,Dawn?
BUFFY,(whispers) Oh god.
DAWN,"(O.S., softly) I didn't ... want to leave her alone."
BUFFY,"Dawn. Sweetheart. (kneeling beside Dawn) Come on. Honey, we need to get out of here, okay? (stroking Dawn's hair) Dawn, sweetheart. Be strong for me, okay?"
BUFFY,"Dawn, we need to go downstairs."
DAWN,(crying) I don't understand.
BUFFY,I don't understand either.
CORONER,If you could just sign this?
XANDER,Sure.
CORONER,"Call this number tomorrow, we'll have more information. (giving Xander a piece of paper)"
XANDER,"Okay, thanks. Thank you."
CORONER,I'm sorry for your loss.
XANDER,So that's it.
BUFFY,Are the police gone too?
XANDER,Coming back tomorrow with more of their pretty yellow tape.
BUFFY,(sighing) We need to find Willow.
XANDER,"Yeah, she's off the wagon big-time. Warren's a dead man if she finds him."
DAWN,(bitterly) Good.
BUFFY,"Dawn, don't say that."
DAWN,Why not? (the others looking at her) I'd do it myself if I could.
BUFFY,Because you don't really feel that way.
DAWN,"Yes I do. And you should too. He killed Tara, and he nearly killed you. He needs to pay."
XANDER,Out of the mouths of babes.
BUFFY,Xander.
XANDER,I'm just saying he's ... he's just as bad as any vampire you've sent to dustville.
BUFFY,Being a Slayer doesn't give me a license to kill. Warren's human.
DAWN,(scoffs) So?
BUFFY,So the human world has its own rules for dealing with people like him.
XANDER,"Yeah, we all know how well those rules work."
BUFFY,Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don't. We can't control the universe. If we were supposed to ... then the magic wouldn't change Willow the way it does. And ... we'd be able to bring Tara back.
DAWN,(very quietly) And Mom.
BUFFY,There are limits to what we can do. There should be. Willow doesn't want to believe that. And now she's messing with forces that want to hurt her. All of us.
XANDER,I just ... I've had blood on my hands all day. (looks Buffy in the eye) Blood from people I love.
BUFFY,I know. And now it has to stop. Warren's going to get what he deserves. I promise . But I will *not* let Willow destroy herself.
XANDER,"Okay, where do we go? She could be anywhere."
BUFFY,"(sighs) I don't know, um ... Maybe the Magic Box for some kind of locating spell. (quickly, to Xander) I could go myself."
XANDER,No no. I'm cool. I'll go.
BUFFY,Dawn can't stay here by herself.
DAWN,Let me go with you. I want to.
BUFFY,"No, honey, it's too dangerous."
DAWN,But ... it's Willow. She needs us.
BUFFY,"She does. And you'll help her. Lots. Okay, but first we have to get her home in one piece."
DAWN,But-
BUFFY,Dawn. I'm serious. You've been through enough for more than one ... ever. You should be someplace where you feel safe.
DAWN,(sullen) Fine. I want to go to Spike's.
BUFFY,All right.
XANDER,What?! Not all right. Are you kidding? After what Spike did-
BUFFY,Xander!
BUFFY,I'll get the coats.
XANDER,(quietly) You're not gonna really leave Dawn with Mr. Attempted Rape.
BUFFY,"(quietly) He won't hurt Dawn. I, he-he physically can't. Besides, he wouldn't."
XANDER,"Well, after the other night, I'd say all bets are off on what he's capable of."
BUFFY,"Dawn feels safe with him. We don't have a choice. Right now, he's all we've got."
Cut to,exterior of a UC Sunnydale dorm building.
WILLOW,"Blood of the slain, hear me. Guide me to Tara's killer."
Cut to,interior Spike's crypt. The TV is showing an old movie.
MAN ON TV,"John, why don't you forget this foolishness?"
MAN #2 ON TV,"Stop right where you are, Mr. Norton."
WOMAN ON TV,John! John!
BUFFY,Spike.
CLEM,Suffering cats!
CLEM,(puts hand on his chest) Where did you come from?
BUFFY,"Oh. Clem, I - sorry, I didn't mean to startle you."
CLEM,"It's, uh, it's okay, you just (chuckles) snuck up on me is all."
BUFFY,(apologetic) I made you spill your snacks.
CLEM,"Nah, don't worry about it. (holds up his arm and indicates loose floppy skin) Like I need any more of this. (waves at Dawn) Oh, hi."
DAWN,Hi.
CLEM,Can I get you ladies something? I was just about to mix up some Country Time.
BUFFY,"We're looking for Spike, actually."
CLEM,He didn't tell you?
BUFFY,Tell me what?
CLEM,He left. Town.
BUFFY,Oh.
DAWN,He just took off?
CLEM,"That's why I'm staying here for him. Sweet pad like this goes empty for a few days, you'll lose it for sure. Plus, I ... (indicates the TV) don't have a TV."
CLEM,"I'm surprised he didn't tell you. He kind of left in a hurry, I guess. (awkwardly) Sure I can't get you something? I've got Bugles and, uh, liverwurst..."
BUFFY,"We're fine, thank you. Um, but you could do us a favor. Do you think maybe Dawn could hang out here with you for a while? I have some stuff that I need to do and, uh, I really don't want her to be alone."
DAWN,I still don't see why I just can't-
BUFFY,Dawn. We've been through this. (to Clem) What do you think?
CLEM,No problem. I'd love the company. (to Dawn) Do you like Parcheesi?
DAWN,(trying to be nice) Sure.
CLEM,"Or, we could rent videos. I've been dying to see ""The Wedding Planner."""
DAWN,Either way. I'm good.
CLEM,"Ooh, and here. (indicates the chair) You can have the comfy chair."
BUFFY,I'll be back as soon as I can. (hugs Dawn) I promise.
DAWN,Okay.
BUFFY,(to Clem) Thank you.
BUFFY,Did he say when he'd be back?
CLEM,Spike? No. Only that he could be gone a while.
Cut to,a view of the moon through an exotic tree. Sound of drums and African pipe music.
VILLAGER,<i>Toyenza coyengara. Erio mtuwana.</i>
SPIKE,"Not asking for permission, mate."
VILLAGER,<i>Ymirira! Odja kufa! Ymirira!</i>
VOICE,"You seek me, vampire?"
SPIKE,You do the finger paintings? Nice work.
DEMON,Answer me.
SPIKE,Yeah. I seek you.
DEMON,Something about a woman. The slayer.
SPIKE,"(nods, barely concealed anger) Thinks she's better than me. Ever since I got this bleeding chip in my head, things ain't been right. Everything's gone to hell."
DEMON,And you want to return to your former self.
SPIKE,Yeah.
SPIKE,What?
DEMON,Look what she's reduced you to.
SPIKE,It's this bloody chip-
DEMON,"You were a legendary dark warrior, and you let yourself be castrated. (Spike looking angry) And you have the audacity to crawl in here and demand restoration?"
SPIKE,I'm still a warrior.
DEMON,You're a pathetic excuse for a demon.
SPIKE,(angry) Yeah? I'll show you pathetic. Give me your best shot.
DEMON,You'd never endure the trials required to grant your request.
SPIKE,Do your worst. But when I win ... I want what I came here for.
SPIKE,Bitch is gonna see a change.
Cut to,"interior magic shop. Close on the piles of books on the table, their pages all blank from Willow's actions earlier."
XANDER,You feeling any change? Can you talk?
ANYA,It's wearing off.
ANYA,Willow was here earlier. She put the whammy on me and went straight to the dark arts books. Sucked them dry.
XANDER,"(awkwardly) Look, Anya, something terrible happened."
ANYA,I know. (softly) Tara.
XANDER,"(nods) Willow's out for blood, big time. We need to find her before she finds Warren. Is there something you can do, a, a locator spell?"
ANYA,I don't need a spell. (a bit reluctantly) I can feel her.
XANDER,You can...?
ANYA,"Feel her. Her thirst for vengeance, it's overwhelming."
XANDER,"Is that like, left over from your vengeance demon days? You just sense her?"
ANYA,No. Not left over.
XANDER,Oh.
ANYA,Yeah. (sound of the bell over the door)
XANDER,When?
ANYA,(sourly) When do you think?
BUFFY,Is everyone okay? Did Willow -
ANYA,Got her power boost and took off.
XANDER,Anya's ... Anya was saying she knows where Willow is.
BUFFY,A spell?
XANDER,(bitterly) Not exactly. Seems Anya got her vengeance on again.
BUFFY,(stares at Anya) Oh.
XANDER,"So, Willow's all wrathy ... why don't you go to her? Isn't that your gig?"
ANYA,"(defensively) Normally, I'd have to ... but she doesn't want me."
BUFFY,She wants to do it herself.
ANYA,Yeah.
BUFFY,"Look, Anya, we don't have much time. Which side of this are you on?"
XANDER,"If you know where she is, you can help us."
ANYA,"(stands up, sighs) I'll help. But I'm helping Willow."
ANYA,She's close to him. He's in the woods.
WILLOW,"Run all night, Warren. I'll still find-"
WILLOW,"Axe, not gonna cut it."
WARREN,(nervous laugh) Cute. That's a cute trick.
WARREN,"It was an accident, you know."
WILLOW,"Oh. You mean, instead of killing my best friend, you killed my girlfriend."
WARREN,"It ... it wasn't personal, that's all."
WILLOW,"Well, this is."
WARREN,Capture!
WILLOW: <i>Irretite.</i> (latin translation,"""entangle"")"
WILLOW,Cute tricks.
WARREN,"You're really asking for it, you know that?"
WILLOW,(incredulous) I'm asking for it?
WARREN,"I'm gonna walk away from this. And when I do, you're gonna beg to go join your little girlfriend."
WILLOW,She wasn't your first.
WARREN,"(nervous) Uh, first who?"
WILLOW,Tara. She wasn't the first girl you killed.
WARREN,I don't know what you're talk-
WILLOW,Reveal!
KATRINA,(O.S.) I should have strangled you in your sleep.
KATRINA,Back when we shared a bed. I should have done the world a favor.
WARREN,(nervous laugh) It's a trick.
KATRINA,"Why, Warren? You could have just let me go."
WARREN,(to Willow) Make it shut up. Make it go away.
KATRINA,It didn't have be like that.
WARREN,(to Willow) I'm not kidding!
KATRINA,"How could you say you loved me, and do that to me?"
WARREN,"(suddenly) Because you deserved it, bitch!"
WILLOW,Because you liked it.
WARREN,"Oh, shut up!"
WILLOW,You never felt you had the power with her. Not until you killed her.
WARREN,"(nasty laugh) Women. You know, you're just like the rest of them. Mind games."
WILLOW,"You get off on it. (moving closer) That's why you had a mad-on for the Slayer. She was your big O, wasn't she, Warren?"
WARREN,(still trembling) Are you done yet? Or can we talk some more about our feelings?
BUFFY,What's happening? What do you feel?
ANYA,She's stronger now. Close.
XANDER,What about Warren? Has she-
ANYA,He's still alive. She's not done.
WARREN,(yells) Help! (normal voice) Let me go. (yells) Somebody! Help!!
WILLOW,What's the matter? Thought you wanted to talk.
WARREN,No.
WILLOW,Okay.
WILLOW,I'll talk.
WARREN,"What, what are you doing?"
WILLOW,Shhh.
WARREN,"(seriously freaked) Hey, hey, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry."
WILLOW,"Wanna know what a bullet feels like, Warren? A real one? (Warren looking nervously down at the bullet, then up at her) It's not like in the comics."
WARREN,No. No.
WILLOW,I think you need to. Feel it.
WARREN,Oh god! Stop it!
WILLOW,"It's not going to make a neat little hole. First, it'll obliterate your internal organs. Your lung will collapse. Feels like drowning."
WARREN,(strained) Please! No.
WILLOW,"When it finally hits your spine, it'll blow your central nervous system."
WARREN,"Oh please, stop, god! Please-"
WILLOW,(angrily) I'm talking!
WILLOW,"The pain will be unbearable, but you won't be able to move. Bullet usually travels faster than this, of course. But the dying? It'll seem like it takes forever."
WILLOW,"Something, isn't it? (pensively) One tiny piece of metal destroys everything. (Warren groaning loudly) It ripped her insides out ... took her light away. From me. From the world."
WILLOW,Now the one person who should be here is gone ... and a waste like you gets to live.
WILLOW,Tiny piece of metal. Can you feel it now?
ANYA,Over there.
WILLOW,"I said, can you feel it?"
WARREN,"Please! God! I did wrong, I see that now. I need, I need jail! I need ... But you, you don't want this. You're, you're not a bad person. Not like me."
BUFFY,(O.S.) Willow!
WARREN,"Oh, and when you get caught, you'll lose them too. Your friends. (panting) You don't want that. I know you're in pain, but-"
WILLOW,Bored now.
XANDER,Oh my god.
BUFFY,(shocked) What did you do?
BUFFY,"Willow, what did you do?"
WILLOW,(calmly) One down.
